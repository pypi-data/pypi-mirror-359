Welcome to DAPyr's documentation!
===================================

DAPyr (pronounced "dapper") is a Python package for running, testing, 
and experimenting with data assimilation methods using Lorenz models. 
DAPyr supports quick configuration and running of experiments, 
allowing one to setup and run data assimilation cycles in as little as 
two lines. In addition, DAPyr utilizes 
`numbalsoda <https://github.com/Nicholaswogan/numbalsoda/tree/main>`_ and 
`numba <https://numba.pydata.org/>`_ for model integration, allowing for 
faster runtimes.

Check out the :doc:`usage <userguide/index>` section for further information, including instructions how to :doc:`install <userguide/installation>` the project.
