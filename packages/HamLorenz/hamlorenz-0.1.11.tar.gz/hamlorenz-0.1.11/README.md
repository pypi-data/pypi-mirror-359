## Hamiltonian Lorenz Models

This package implements **Hamiltonian Lorenz-like models**, a class of low-order dynamical systems that extend the classical Lorenz-96 and Lorenz-2005 frameworks by incorporating a **Hamiltonian structure**. These models are designed to preserve certain physical invariants—such as energy and Casimirs—making them particularly well-suited for studying conservative dynamical systems, geophysical flows, and chaotic transport.

## Installation 
Installation within a Python virtual environment: 
```
python3 -m pip install hamlorenz
```

### Features

* **Hamiltonian structure**: The time evolution of the system is derived from a Hamiltonian, preserving energy exactly as in the continuous-time limit.
* **Casimir invariants**: Multiple conserved quantities beyond energy, ensuring the system evolves on a constrained manifold.
* **Symplectic integrators**: Optional numerical solvers designed for long-time energy and Casimir invariant preservation.
* **Lyapunov spectrum computation**: Quantifies the level of chaos in the system via Lyapunov exponents.
* **Fourier-based desymmetrization**: Enables translational symmetry reduction to study physical variables in a more interpretable form.
* **PDF and time series visualization**: Built-in tools to analyze and visualize system statistics and dynamics.

### Applications

* Modeling barotropic dynamics or simplified atmospheric flows.
* Testing chaos detection and prediction techniques.
* Benchmarking conservative integration schemes.
