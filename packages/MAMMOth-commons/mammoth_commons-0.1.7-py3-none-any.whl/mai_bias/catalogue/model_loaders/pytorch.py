        state_path: The path in which the architecture's state is stored.
        model_path: The path in which the architecture's initialization script resides. Alternatively, you may also just paste the initialization code in this field.

        safe_libraries: A comma-separated list of libraries that can be imported.
        multiclass_threshold: A decision threshold that treats outputs as separate classes. If this is set to zero (default), a softmax is applied to outputs. For binary classification, this is equivalent to setting the decision threshold at 0.5. Otherwise, each output is thresholded separately.
