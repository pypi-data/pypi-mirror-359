"""
This file does not contain the functions needed for universal simulation.
It only includes the funcitons needed for simulating the Clifford + S + T
gates and their inverses. By Clifford, we mean {H,Z,CZ,CCZ} set here. 

This file contain all the essential functions required for each step
from creating the polynomial as an array, to returning the final 
state vector after calculating the truth table for each possible values
of variables.
