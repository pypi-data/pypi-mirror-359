## Overview

SQLAlchemy ViewORM extends SQLAlchemy's ORM to provide a clean, Pythonic interface for creating and managing database views. It supports:

- **Standard views**: Traditional simple SQL views that execute their query on each access
- **Materialized views**: Views that store their results physically for faster access
- **Table-simulated views**: For databases that don't support views or materialized views
- **Cross-database compatibility**: Works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and more
- **Materialized view emulation**: for DBMSs without materialized views support like SQLite,
  you can choose what method to use for each model:
  treat as a simple view or mock by a regular table â€“ useful for tests.
- **Dialect-aware features**: Allows views' queries customisation for each database
- **Type annotations**: Fully typed with mypy support.

Well, I developed the lib for my own needs, because lots of other implementations that I found look too weak, and I strive for flexibility with comprehensive features.

## Installation

```bash
pip install SQLAlchemy-ViewORM
```

## Quick Example

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Boolean, select
from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase
from sqlalchemy_view_orm import ViewBase, ViewConfig

# Regular SQLAlchemy model
class Base(DeclarativeBase):
    pass

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    email = Column(String)
    active = Column(Boolean, default=True)

# Define a view based on the User model
class ActiveUserView(ViewBase):
    __tablename__ = "active_users_view"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    email = Column(String)

    # Define view configuration
    __view_config__ = ViewConfig(

        # Define the view's query
        definition=select(
            User.id, User.name, User.email
        ).where(User.active == True),

        # Create as materialized view for better performance
        materialized=True,

        # Enable concurrent refresh (PostgreSQL)
        concurrently=True
    )

# Create the view in the database
engine = create_engine("postgresql://user:pass@localhost/dbname")
ActiveUserView.metadata.create_all(engine)

# Refresh materialized view data
with engine.begin() as conn:
    for cmd in ActiveUserView.get_refresh_cmds(engine):
        conn.execute(cmd)
```

## Features

### View Types

- **Simple Views**: Standard non-materialized views.
  ```python
  __view_config__ = ViewConfig(
      definition=my_select_query,
      materialized=False  # Default
  )
  ```

- **Materialized Views**: Physically stored query results, in DBMSs that supported materialized views (e.g. PostgreSQL and Oracle), and simple views are used in other cases.
  ```python
  __view_config__ = ViewConfig(
      definition=my_select_query,
      materialized=True
  )
  ```

- **Table Views**: For databases without native materialized view support (like SQLite, MySQL), you easily can emulate them with tables.
  ```python
  __view_config__ = ViewConfig(
      definition=my_select_query,
      materialized=True,
      materialized_as_table=True  # Use tables to simulate materialized views
  )
  ```

Which is pretty helpful when developing apps for Postgres while testing with SQLite. Frankly speaking, this is why I developed the lib ðŸ™‚

### Advanced Usage

Define views with dynamic queries to adjust by considering database dialect:

```python
def build_query(dialect):
    # Adapt the query based on the database dialect
    if dialect == 'postgresql':
        return select(User.id, func.lower(User.email).label('email'))
    else:
        # Simpler version for other databases
        return select(User.id, User.email)

class UserEmailView(ViewBase):
    __tablename__ = "user_email_view"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    email = Column(String)

    __view_config__ = ViewConfig(
        definer=build_query,  # Pass a function instead of a fixed query
        materialized=True
    )
```

## Why Use SQLAlchemy ViewORM?

Database views offer numerous advantages:

1. **Abstraction**: Hide complex queries behind simple interfaces
2. **Performance**: Materialized views improve query speed for complex calculations
3. **Consistency**: Ensure the same ORM-based query logic is used across your application
4. **Security**: Restrict access to sensitive data

This library makes it easy to leverage these benefits within your SQLAlchemy applications.
