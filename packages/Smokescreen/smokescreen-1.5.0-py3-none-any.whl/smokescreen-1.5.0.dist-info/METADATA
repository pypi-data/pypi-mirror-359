# Smokescreen: DESC Modules for data concealment (blinding)
> :warning: Important notice :warning: : the term "blinding" is used in the context of data concealment for scientific analysis. We understand this is an outdated term and we are working to update it to a more appropriate term. If you have any suggestions, please let us know.
This repository (under development) contains the modules for data concealment (blinding) at the following levels of the analysis:
- Data-vector measurements
- Posterior distribution [not yet developed]
- (TBC) Catalogues

**You can find the documentation for Smokescreen [here](https://lsstdesc.org/Smokescreen/).**

## Quick Installation
You can install Smokescreen using conda:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge lsstdesc-smokescreen
```

For developer installation or other instructions check the [documentation](https://lsstdesc.org/Smokescreen/installation.html).

For questions contact @arthurmloureiro, @jessmuir, or @jablazek
