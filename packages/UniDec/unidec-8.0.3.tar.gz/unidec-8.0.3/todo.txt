Tim Bug Fixes and Feature Suggestions

Mass Defect tracking to align phases of isotopic distributions for reasonable things

UCD handle sub-integer charge smoothing

Issues with Thrash predictor on thrash_test_data.

Lower Priority:

UniDec rewrite into Cmake

Importer testing for Sciex

UniDec/IsoDec Chimera


Someday Maybe:

Thermo centroided data loading in IsoDecGUI

polarity switching, or "weaving" between scans

Have eng inherit runtime

Cmake install on visual studio

Saer centroiding algorithm

Overlapping Distribution Problem

Correct IsoDec-Py and IsoDec-C divergence (appears to be a charge prediction difference?)
