# Ado Wrapper

This is a Python Package which works as an interface to the Azure DevOps API

It is essentially a wrapper for the (horrible to work with) ADO API, and supports OOP principals.

Any resource can be fetched by calling the `<resource>.get_by_id()` function.

It also includes a solution for managing resources created by this script, which is extremely useful for testing the creation of random resources.
To delete all resources created by this, run the main module with the "--delete-everything" flag.

If you're reading this readme not from the code, here's a link to the [github repo](https://github.com/UP929312/ado-wrapper)


## Setup

It's recommended you create your own ADO organisation and project for testing/development, this is easy and means that  
you won't delete anything or cause problems, but may mean you're missing features such as certain teams or repos.

To test/add to this locally, you'll need to create a few files:  

For tests, add tests/test_data.txt, which contains:
```
ADO Organisation name  
ADO Project name (e.g. MyProject)  
ADO Secondary project name (e.g. can be empty for your testing, so just an empty line unless you're testing the client)  
Email: e.g. first.last@company.com  
Pat token (with good perms), https://dev.azure.com/<ORG>/_usersSettings/tokens  
Existing User ID, print(AdoUser.get_by_email(ado_client, "first.last@company.com").origin_id)  
Existing user descriptor, print(AdoUser.get_by_email(ado_client, "first.last@company.com").descriptor_id)  
```
For development, I recommend adding a script.py with this boiler plate:  

```py
with open("credentials.txt", "r") as file:
    email, ado_access_token, ado_org_name, ado_project = file.read().split("\n")

from ado_wrapper import AdoClient, Secret
from ado_wrapper.resources import *
from ado_wrapper.errors import *
ado_client = AdoClient(email, ado_access_token, ado_org_name, ado_project)
```
And then fill credentials.txt with email, PAT, org, project on different lines.
