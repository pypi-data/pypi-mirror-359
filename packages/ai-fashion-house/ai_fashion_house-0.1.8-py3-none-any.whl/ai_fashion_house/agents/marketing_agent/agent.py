        "1. Accept a user-provided concept â€” this may be abstract, loosely defined, or stylistically expressive.\n"
        "2. Invoke the **style_agent_tool** to interpret the concept and generate a vivid, structured, and fashion-specific prompt.\n"
        "3. Pass the refined prompt to the **image_generation_tool** to produce a high-quality fashion image.\n"
        "4. Use the resulting image: `generated_image.png` to create a short, cinematic fashion video targeting a fashion-forward audience.\n\n"
        "5. Write an strong social media post that captures the essence of the fashion image and video, designed to engage and inspire followers.\n\n"
