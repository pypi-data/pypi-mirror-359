# Strategy Template

This strategy template provides a starting point for creating a new strategy on the Almanak framework. This vanilla template contains the basic required foundation for the Strategy framework to operate.
It currently does nothing and is ready for your ideas to come to life!

## Usage
1. Install the `almanak-sdk`. See the guide here.
2. Read the guide on [How to Create a Strategy](https://docs.almanak.co/docs/create-strategy/)
3. Start implementing your ideas.
4. Test frequently via the sdk `almanak strat test ...`
5. Deploy on the platform via the sdk `almanak strat push ...`
