## Introduction
APC is a decentralized orchestration protocol for heterogeneous AI agent ecosystems. It enables dynamic leadership hand-off, sequenced task execution, checkpointing, failover, and auditability—all without centralized control.

---

## Design Rationale & Goals
- **Decentralized Leadership**: No single point of failure; any agent can become conductor.
- **Dynamic Sequencing**: Workflows defined at runtime, supporting evolving subtask lists.
- **Resilience & Checkpointing**: Recover from agent failures via checkpoints and takeover.
- **Interoperability**: Protobuf/JSON schemas for cross-language support.
- **Extensibility & Security**: Add new message types, mTLS/JWT, and policy enforcement.

---

## Architecture Overview

<img alt="APC Architecture" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepfarkade/apc-protocol/main/docs/images/apc-architecture.png">

🔧 **APC Protocol – High-Level Architecture Summary**
This diagram showcases the core runtime structure of the APC (Agent Protocol for Choreography) system.

- **Conductor Agent:** The central orchestrator that assigns tasks to Worker Agents based on a known plan. It maintains execution state and error recovery logic.
- **gRPC/WebSocket Layer:** A communication backbone that enables bidirectional, low-latency messaging between Conductor and Worker Agents.
- **Worker Agent:** These agents perform domain-specific subtasks. They respond to commands from the Conductor and return results or status updates.
- **Checkpoint Store:** A persistent storage layer used by the Conductor to save execution state. On system failure, it allows the Conductor to recover seamlessly without restarting the entire flow.

This modular setup enables dynamic, scalable, and fault-tolerant agent workflows where control is coordinated yet loosely coupled through standardized message passing and recovery mechanisms.

---

## Message Schemas
- Defined in [proto/apc.proto](../proto/apc.proto)
- Protobuf v3 for cross-language support
- Core messages: `ProposeTask`, `Accept`, `Reject`, `Completed`, `Failed`, `TakeOver`, etc.

---

## State Machines
- **Conductor**: Handles batch goals, proposes tasks, sequences steps, manages failover.
- **Worker**: Accepts/rejects tasks, executes, reports completion/failure.
- **CheckpointManager**: Saves and restores state for resilience.

---

## Checkpointing & Failover
- Pluggable backends: In-memory, Redis, S3
- Auto-checkpointing and recovery logic
- TakeOver messages for dynamic leadership

---

## Transport Adapters
- gRPC: High-performance, strongly-typed
- WebSocket: Lightweight, browser-friendly
- Easily extendable for other transports

---

## Security & Policy
- mTLS: X.509 certificate-based mutual authentication
- JWT: Role/scopes encoded in tokens
- Policy engine for compliance and data sensitivity

---

## Registry & Discovery
- Optional: Register, discover, and load-balance agents
- Example: `registerAgent()`, `discoverAgents(filter)`

---

## SDK Usage
- See [examples/](../examples/) for sample agents
- Install via `pip install apc-protocol`
- Subclass `Conductor` or `Worker` and implement your logic
- Integrate LLMs or custom business logic as needed

### Basic Usage
```python
from apc import Worker, Conductor
from apc.transport import GRPCTransport

# Create a worker
worker = Worker("my-worker", roles=["processor"])

@worker.register_handler("my_task")
async def handle_task(batch_id, step_name, params):
    return {"result": "completed"}

# Setup transport
transport = GRPCTransport(port=50051)
worker.bind_transport(transport)
await transport.start_server()
```

---

## Examples
- [Basic gRPC Example](../examples/basic/simple_grpc.py)
- [LLM Agent Integration](../examples/agents/llm_agent.py)
- [Data Processing Pipeline](../examples/agents/data_processor.py)

### Quick Start Example
```python
# Install: pip install apc-protocol
from apc import Worker
import asyncio

async def main():
    worker = Worker("demo-worker", roles=["demo"])
    
    @worker.register_handler("demo_task")
    async def demo_handler(batch_id, step_name, params):
        return {"message": "Hello from APC!", "data": params}
    
    print("Worker ready!")
    # Add your transport setup here

asyncio.run(main())
```

## FAQ
**Q: Can I use APC with Node.js, Go, or Java?**
A: Yes! Use the Protobuf schema to generate SDKs for any language.

**Q: How do I add a new message type?**
A: Extend the Protobuf schema and regenerate code.

**Q: How do I contribute?**
A: Fork the repo, branch, and submit a PR!

---

## 🧠 Why APC? (The Evolutionary Backdrop)

**MCP (Message-Centered Protocol)** gave agents a common language for basic send/receive—everyone could talk, but only at the lowest level.

**A2A (Agent-to-Agent)** enabled direct peer-to-peer links, letting Agent A push subtasks straight to Agent B. This improved speed, but made systems brittle at scale.

**ACP (Agent Control Protocol)** introduced a central orchestrator to sequence tasks and enforce policies. This fixed deadlocks, but reintroduced a single point of failure and made most agents passive workers.

All three advanced the field, but none provided a flexible, fault-tolerant way for agents to coordinate and think for themselves in complex, branching workflows.

---

## 🚀 Why APC Is the Next Leap

- **Distributed “Conductors”**: Any agent can temporarily assume the conductor role for a workflow, enabling sequencing, dependency checks, and deadlock avoidance—without a heavy, central master.
- **Plug-and-Play Orchestration**: Agents register their orchestration capabilities and load. If one goes offline, another takes over automatically.
- **Context-Aware Scheduling**: Conductors probe agent readiness, context, and load before launching subtasks, avoiding mid-pipeline failures.
- **Graceful Preemption & Handoffs**: When priorities shift, conductors checkpoint running subtasks and offer them to peers—no more “hung” workflows.

---

## 🌟 The Transformative Impact

- **Elastic Workflows**: Agents can dynamically lead or follow, adapting to changing needs.
- **No Orchestration Silos**: Get the governance of ACP without the latency or single-point-of-failure risk.
- **Simplified Developer Experience**: Define tasks and dependencies once—APC’s conductor handshakes handle the rest.

**In short:** APC doesn’t just mediate “who talks to whom”; it embeds a living, breathing conductor in every agent ecosystem—unlocking true multi-agent creativity, resilience, and scale. That’s why APC is the next flagship protocol for Gen-AI agents.

## More Real-World Scenarios & Diagrams

### 📦 Scenario 1: Multi‑Stage Data Pipeline

<img alt="Multi‑Stage Data Pipeline APC Architecture" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepfarkade/apc-protocol/main/docs/images/Scenerio-1.png">

**APC in Action:**

- **Dynamic Conductor Claim:** Agent X volunteers as conductor for this ETL batch.
- **Sequenced Proposals:** X “PROPOSE_TASK: Extract” → Y; on completion, “PROPOSE_TASK: Transform” → Z; then “PROPOSE_TASK: Load” → W.
- **Checkpointing:** After each subtask, X records progress (e.g. raw data, cleaned data) in the checkpoint store.
- **Failover:** If Y times out or fails, X issues a TAKE_OVER and re‑proposes extract to Y2.
- **Completion:** Once W reports “COMPLETED,” X closes the batch.

---

### 💬 Scenario 2: LLM‑Driven Multi‑Agent Chat

<img alt="LLM‑Driven Multi‑Agent Chat APC Architecture" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepfarkade/apc-protocol/main/docs/images/Scenerio-2.png">

**APC in Action:**

- **Orchestration Start:** M receives a new user message and becomes conductor for that turn.
- **LLM Call:** M “PROPOSE_TASK: Generate” → N; N returns the text response.
- **Tool Execution:** M then “PROPOSE_TASK: ToolCall” → O (e.g., fetch weather API); O returns results.
- **Resilience:** If N fails to reply, M “TAKE_OVER” and sends generate request to N2.
- **Unified Flow:** M aggregates both responses, then sends back to the user—all under one batch ID.

---

### 🖼️ Scenario 3: Distributed Image Processing

<img alt="Distributed Image Processing APC Architecture" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepfarkade/apc-protocol/main/docs/images/Scenerio-3.png">

**APC in Action:**

- **Initiation:** P kicks off the image batch, claiming conductor duties.
- **Preprocessing:** P → Q to resize/normalize; upon “COMPLETED,” P → R to classify.
- **Annotation:** After labels arrive, P → S to overlay annotations.
- **Checkpointing & Recovery:** P checkpoints image states after each stage. If Q fails, P hands off to Q2, which resumes from last checkpoint.
- **End‑to‑End Audit:** All message exchanges and checkpoint snapshots are logged for traceability.

---

### 🚚 Scenario 4: Autonomous Fleet Coordination

<img alt="Autonomous Fleet Coordination APC Architecture" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepfarkade/apc-protocol/main/docs/images/Scenerio-4.png">

**APC in Action:**

- **Task Assignment:** F as conductor proposes “Deliver” to G and H in parallel (two drones).
- **Status Aggregation:** Each drone reports back “COMPLETED” when the package is dropped.
- **Last‑Mile Handoff:** F then “PROPOSE_TASK: Last Mile” → I (ground robot).
- **Fault Tolerance:** If G fails mid‑flight, F uses TAKE_OVER to reassign its route to G2 with the same mission parameters.
- **Coordinated Finish:** F collects all completions and closes the delivery workflow.

## 🚀 **How APC Stands Out from AutoGen & Other Multi-Agent Frameworks**

### 🎯 **The Critical Difference: Protocol vs Framework**

| Aspect | **AutoGen (Framework)** | **APC (Protocol + SDK)** |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Architecture** | Application framework with predefined patterns | **Distributed protocol** with pluggable components |
| **Agent Coordination** | Round-robin, sequential chat patterns | **Dynamic leadership** with distributed conductors |
| **State Management** | Conversation history in memory | **Distributed checkpointing** (Redis, S3) with automatic recovery |
| **Failure Recovery** | Manual intervention required | **Automatic takeover** and seamless recovery |
| **Language Support** | Python-centric | **Cross-language** (Python, TypeScript, Java, .NET) via Protobuf |
| **Deployment Model** | Single-process or simple distribution | **Truly distributed** with service discovery |
| **Production Readiness** | Research/prototyping focused | **Enterprise-ready** with security (mTLS, JWT) |

### 🔥 **Key Architectural Advantages**

#### **1. 🎭 Dynamic Leadership vs Fixed Orchestration**

**AutoGen Approach:**
```python
# Fixed conversation pattern - rigid flow
team = RoundRobinGroupChat([agent1, agent2, agent3])
# If agent2 fails, conversation breaks
# Manual recovery required
```

**APC Approach:**
```python
# Any agent can become conductor dynamically
# If current conductor fails, another takes over automatically
# Zero manual intervention needed
conductor1 = Conductor("main")  # Primary
conductor2 = Conductor("backup")  # Can take over seamlessly

workflow.add_step("task1", required_role="processor")
# APC automatically routes to available agents
# If processor1 fails, processor2 takes over from checkpoint
```

#### **2. 💾 Enterprise-Grade Checkpointing vs Memory-Only State**

**AutoGen Limitations:**
- Conversation state lost on failure
- No distributed state management
- Manual recovery from failures

**APC Advantages:**
```python
# Automatic distributed checkpointing
checkpoint_manager = CheckpointManager(
    backend=RedisBackend(redis_client),  # or S3Backend
    interval=30  # Auto-save every 30 seconds
)

# If any agent fails:
# 1. State automatically saved to Redis/S3
# 2. Another agent picks up from exact checkpoint
# 3. Zero data loss, zero manual intervention
```

#### **3. 🌐 True Cross-Language vs Python-Only**

**Protocol Comparison:**
```protobuf
// Protobuf schemas enable true cross-language support
service AgentProtocol {
  rpc ProposeTask(TaskProposal) returns (TaskResponse);
  rpc ReportCompletion(CompletionReport) returns (Acknowledgment);
}

// Same protocol works in:
// - Python agents
// - TypeScript/Node.js agents  
// - Java/Scala agents
// - .NET agents
```

#### **4. 🏭 Production-Ready vs Research Framework**

```python
# Built-in security
transport = GRPCTransport(
    port=50051,
    enable_mtls=True,  # Mutual TLS authentication
    jwt_secret="your-secret",  # JWT token validation
    policy_engine=PolicyEngine()  # Compliance rules
)

# Service discovery
registry = ServiceRegistry(backend="consul")  
conductor.register_with_registry(registry)

# Load balancing
worker_pool = WorkerPool(min_workers=3, max_workers=10)
```

### 🚀 **Real-World Scenario: Why This Matters**

#### **Scenario: Financial Trading System with 10 Agents**

**With AutoGen (Traditional Framework):**
```python
# Problem: Round-robin chat breaks if any agent fails
agents = [risk_analyzer, portfolio_manager, trade_executor, ...]
team = RoundRobinGroupChat(agents)

# What happens when trade_executor crashes?
# ❌ Entire conversation stops
# ❌ Manual restart required  
# ❌ State/context lost
# ❌ Trades may be duplicated or lost
# ❌ No automatic recovery
```

**With APC (Protocol-Based):**
```python
# Multiple conductors can manage the workflow
primary_conductor = Conductor("trading-conductor-1")
backup_conductor = Conductor("trading-conductor-2")

workflow.add_step("risk_analysis", required_role="risk_analyzer")
workflow.add_step("execute_trade", required_role="trade_executor", 
                  dependencies=["risk_analysis"])

# What happens when trade_executor crashes?
# ✅ Backup trade_executor automatically takes over
# ✅ Continues from exact checkpoint  
# ✅ No data loss or duplication
# ✅ Zero manual intervention
# ✅ Full audit trail maintained
```

### 🎯 **When to Choose APC vs AutoGen**

#### **Choose AutoGen When:**
- 🔬 **Research/prototyping** with simple conversational agents
- 🏠 **Single-machine** deployments
- 📝 **Document processing** or basic chat workflows
- 👨‍💻 **Python-only** environment

#### **Choose APC When:**
- 🏭 **Production systems** requiring high availability
- 💰 **Financial/critical** applications where failures are costly
- 🌐 **Multi-language** agent ecosystems  
- 📊 **Complex workflows** with dynamic dependencies
- 🔧 **Enterprise deployment** with security/compliance needs
- ⚡ **Real-time systems** requiring low-latency coordination

### 💡 **Bottom Line**

**AutoGen** is excellent for **conversational AI research** and **simple chat-based workflows**.

**APC** is designed for **production-grade multi-agent systems** where **failure is not an option** and **scalability matters**.

Think of it this way:
- **AutoGen** = WordPress (great for blogs, limited for enterprise)
- **APC** = Kubernetes (enterprise-grade orchestration with true resilience)

# 🎯 **How APC Stands Out: A Comprehensive Protocol Comparison**

After extensive research into current multi-agent protocols, here's how APC differentiates itself and provides unique value:

---

## 📚 **Protocol Landscape Overview**

### **1. ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) by IBM**
- **Focus**: Ontology-based communication using speech acts (ask-one, tell, etc.)
- **Architecture**: Fixed message schemas with predefined performatives
- **Limitations**: 
  - Rigid ontology requirements across all agents
  - No built-in orchestration or workflow management
  - Limited fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms
  - Heavy reliance on shared knowledge bases

### **2. A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol) by Google**
- **Focus**: Direct peer-to-peer agent communication
- **Architecture**: Point-to-point messaging using Protocol Buffers
- **Limitations**:
  - No centralized coordination or sequencing
  - Prone to deadlocks in complex workflows
  - Manual dependency management required
  - Limited error handling and recovery

### **3. MCP (Model Context Protocol)**
- **Focus**: Standardized way to connect LLMs to data sources and tools
- **Architecture**: Client-server with 1:1 connections between hosts and servers
- **Limitations**:
  - Single-threaded interaction model
  - No multi-agent orchestration capabilities
  - Limited to context provision, not workflow execution
  - No built-in checkpointing or state management

### **4. AutoGen by Microsoft**
- **Focus**: Conversational multi-agent framework
- **Architecture**: Round-robin and group chat patterns
- **Limitations**:
  - Conversation breaks if any agent fails
  - Manual intervention required for recovery
  - Memory-only state management
  - Python-centric with limited cross-language support

---

## 🚀 **How APC Revolutionizes Multi-Agent Systems**

### **🎭 1. Dynamic Distributed Leadership**

**Traditional Protocols:**
```python
# Fixed orchestration - single point of failure
central_orchestrator = CentralController()
if central_orchestrator.fails():
    # Entire system stops
    system.halt()
```

**APC Innovation:**
```python
# Any agent can become conductor dynamically
conductor_pool = [agent1, agent2, agent3]
if current_conductor.fails():
    backup_conductor = select_available_conductor()
    backup_conductor.resume_from_checkpoint()
    # Zero downtime, seamless continuation
```

### **💾 2. Enterprise-Grade Checkpointing**

**Traditional Limitations:**
- **AutoGen**: Conversation state lost on failure
- **MCP**: No state persistence between sessions
- **ACP/A2A**: Manual state management required

**APC Advantage:**
```python
# Automatic distributed checkpointing
checkpoint_manager = CheckpointManager(
    backend=RedisBackend(),  # or S3, MongoDB
    interval=30,  # Auto-save every 30 seconds
    compression=True,
    encryption=True
)

# Complete workflow state preserved
workflow_state = {
    "current_step": "data_processing",
    "completed_steps": ["extraction", "validation"],
    "agent_states": {...},
    "intermediate_results": {...},
    "timing_metadata": {...}
}
```

### **🌐 3. Protocol-Based Cross-Language Potential**

**Current Implementation:**
| Protocol | Language Support | Implementation Status |
|----------|------------------|-----------------------|
| **ACP** | Java-focused | Limited to JVM ecosystem |
| **A2A** | Protocol Buffers | Good serialization, poor orchestration |
| **MCP** | Multi-language | Context only, no workflow coordination |
| **AutoGen** | Python-centric | Limited cross-language agents |
| **APC** | **Python (Full) + Cross-language ready** | **Protobuf foundation + Python SDK** |

**APC Cross-Language Foundation:**
```protobuf
// Universal protocol definition in proto/apc.proto
service APCService {
  rpc ProposeTask(ProposeTaskRequest) returns (Response);
  rpc SendAccept(AcceptResponse) returns (Response);
  rpc SendCompleted(CompletedNotification) returns (Response);
  rpc SendFailed(FailedNotification) returns (Response);
  rpc SendTakeOver(TakeOverRequest) returns (Response);
}

// ✅ Current: Python SDK (fully implemented)
// 🚧 Roadmap: TypeScript, Java, .NET SDKs
// 📋 Protocol ready: Any language can implement APC via Protobuf
```

**Cross-Language Status:**
- ✅ **Protobuf schema**: Universal protocol definition ready
- ✅ **Python SDK**: Complete implementation with all features
- 🚧 **Other languages**: Protobuf allows any language to implement APC clients
- 📋 **Community**: Ready for community contributions of additional language SDKs

### **🔄 4. Intelligent Workflow Orchestration**

**Traditional Approach:**
```python
# Manual dependency management and sequencing
def run_pipeline():
    step1_result = agent1.extract_data()
    if step1_result.success:
        step2_result = agent2.validate_data(step1_result.data)
        if step2_result.success:
            step3_result = agent3.process_data(step2_result.data)
            # 50+ lines of manual orchestration code
```

**APC Approach:**
```python
# Declarative workflow definition
workflow = conductor.create_workflow("data_pipeline")
workflow.add_step("extract", required_role="extractor")
workflow.add_step("validate", required_role="validator", 
                  dependencies=["extract"])
workflow.add_step("process", required_role="processor",
                  dependencies=["validate"])

# APC handles everything automatically:
# - Role-based agent selection
# - Dependency resolution
# - Error handling and retries
# - Performance monitoring
# - Automatic scaling
result = await conductor.execute_workflow(workflow)
```

## 🎯 **Real-World Impact: Why APC Matters**

### **🏭 Enterprise Production Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Financial Trading System**
**Problem with Traditional Protocols:**
- **AutoGen**: Round-robin chat breaks if risk analyzer fails → trading halts
- **MCP**: No coordination between multiple analysis models
- **ACP**: Complex ontology setup for financial terminology
- **A2A**: Manual coordination leads to race conditions

**APC Solution:**
```python
# Multiple redundant conductors
primary_conductor = Conductor("trading-primary")
backup_conductor = Conductor("trading-backup")

workflow.add_step("risk_analysis", required_role="risk_analyzer")
workflow.add_step("compliance_check", required_role="compliance_officer")
workflow.add_step("execute_trade", required_role="trade_executor",
                  dependencies=["risk_analysis", "compliance_check"])

# Automatic failover:
# - If risk_analyzer_1 fails → risk_analyzer_2 takes over
# - If primary_conductor fails → backup_conductor resumes
# - All state preserved via distributed checkpoints
# - Complete audit trail maintained
```

#### **Scenario 2: Healthcare Diagnosis Pipeline**
**Traditional Protocol Challenges:**
- **Patient data privacy** requires secure multi-agent coordination
- **Critical timing** - diagnosis delays can be life-threatening
- **Regulatory compliance** needs complete audit trails
- **Multi-specialist coordination** across different systems

**APC Benefits:**
```python
# Secure, compliant, fault-tolerant workflow
workflow = conductor.create_workflow("diagnosis_pipeline")
workflow.add_step("image_analysis", required_role="radiology_ai")
workflow.add_step("symptom_analysis", required_role="clinical_ai")
workflow.add_step("specialist_review", required_role="human_specialist",
                  dependencies=["image_analysis", "symptom_analysis"])

# Built-in features:
# - mTLS encryption for patient data
# - HIPAA-compliant audit logging
# - Automatic backup specialist assignment
# - Real-time progress monitoring
# - Instant failover if any AI model becomes unavailable
```
