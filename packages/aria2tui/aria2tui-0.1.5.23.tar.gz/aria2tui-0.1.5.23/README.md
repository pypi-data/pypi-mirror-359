# Aria2TUI

Aria2TUI is a TUI frontend for the Aria2 download utility which fetches data from an aria2c daemon over RPC and displays it using my TUI picker [listpick](https://github.com/grimandgreedy/listpick).

## Quickstart

Install aria2tui using pip and add download the config file.

```
python -m pip install aria2tui &&
mkdir ~/.config/aria2tui/ &&
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grimandgreedy/Aria2TUI/refs/heads/master/src/aria2tui/data/config.toml -O ~/.config/aria2tui/config.toml
```

After editing your config and ensuring that your url, port, and secret token are correct you are all set to go:

```
aria2tui
```

If you have multiple daemons you can specify another config file:

```
ARIA2TUI_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config/aria2c_torrents.toml aria2tui
ARIA2TUI_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config/aria_on_home_server_config.toml aria2tui
```

If you wish to use it regularly, then it may be useful to add aliases to your ~/.bashrc.
```
alias a2="python /path/to/Aria2TUI/aria2tui.py"
alias a2t="ARIA2TUI_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config/aria2c_torrents.toml aria2tui"
alias a2n="ARIA2TUI_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config/aria_on_home_server_config.toml aria2tui"
```

in addition to those requirements the application uses:
 - `nvim` for viewing/editing download options as well as adding URIs, magnet links and torrent files
 - `xdg-open` and `gio` for opening files.

## Tips

 - Press '?' to see the help page which will list the available keys.
 - If you have problems starting aria2c, check that you have an aria2c config file at ~/.config/aria2/aria2.conf

## Important

While I use Aria2TUI every day, it is still in development and there are many things that still need to be cleaned up.

Some things that should be mentioned:

 - Realistically Aria2TUI will only work in a UNIX (linux, macos) environment. If you register your interest I might be able to look into what I would need to change.
 - If you are performing bulk operations and the downloads are changing state rapidly--e.g., hundreds of images are changing from active/waiting to completed--it is recommended to stop the auto-refresh and operate on a static list.
    - This can be done by either:
      - exiting to the main menu ('q') and going to "View Downloads"; or
      - Pressing ~ and toggling the auto-refresh in the default "Watch Downloads" viewer.
    - You know that auto-refresh is active because there is a refresh symbol in the top right.
 - Note: This was created for personal use and so some of the code is quite ugly and/or buggy and simply needs to be re-written.
