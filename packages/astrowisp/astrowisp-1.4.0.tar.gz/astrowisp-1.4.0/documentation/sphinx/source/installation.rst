We provide wheels for many operating systems, python versions, and
architectures. In most cases::

    pip install astrowisp

or::

    pip install astrowisp --user

should work for Linux, Windows, and MacOS (13 or earlier). Installation on MacOS
Apple chip MacOS computers is not currently supported, but we plan to add it in
the future. At the time of writing, the latest supported python version is 3.12.
