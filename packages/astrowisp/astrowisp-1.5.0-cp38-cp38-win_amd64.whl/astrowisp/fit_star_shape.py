    """
    Fit for the PSF/PRF of stars and their flux.

    The PSF and PRF describe the distribution of light from a point source at
    infinity on the imaging device pixels.

        * PSF is the distribution of light produced by the optical system in the
          plane of the detector for a point source at infinity.

        * PRF is the response of a detector pixel at some offset from the
          center of the source. That is, the PRF is the PSF convolved with
          the sensitivity of detector pixels.

    Both representations use a general piece-wise polynomial model in which the
    area around the source location is split into a rectangular, but in general
    irregular, grid of cells. Over each cell the PSF/PRF is modeled as a
    bi-cubic polynomial. The resulting function is constraned to have continuous
    values, first order derivatives and x-y cross-derivative across cell
    boundaries. Further, it's value, first derivative and the x-y cross
    derivative are contsrainted to go to zero on the outside boundaries of the
    grid.

    Attributes:
        _library_psf_fitter:    The library object for carrying out PSF/PRF
            fitting.

        _library_configuration:    Library configuration object set per the
            current :attr:`configuration`

        _result_tree:    The IOTree instance containing the last
            fittintg results, on None, if no fitting has been performed yet.

        mode(str):    Are we doing 'PSF' or 'PRF' fitting (case
            insensitive).

        configuration (dict):    The configuraiton for how to carry out PSF/PRF
            fitting. The following keys are used (others are ignored by this
            class):

            mode (str):
                What kind of fitting to do 'PSF' or 'PRF' (case insensitive).

            grid (list of floats):
                A comma separated list of grid boundaries.  Can either be a
                single list, in which case it is used for both the horizontal
                and vertical boundaries. If different splitting is desired in
                the two directions, two lists should be supplied separated by
                ``;``. The first list should contain the vertical (x) boundaries
                and the second list gives the horizontal (y) ones. Sometimes it
                is desirable to treat the PSF as a uniform distribution of light
                over pixels. This is accomplished by setting a grid with just
                outer boundaries (e.g. ``-5,5``) which automatically makes the
                PSF equal to zero everywhere, leaving only the background (i.e.
                flat light distribution). If such a grid is set, this also
                changes how stars excluded from shape fitting are treated.
                Normally, the fluxes of these stars are fit after the shape is
                determined using the "good" stars, but if zero PSF model is
                used, any sources excluded from the shape fit through the other
                configurations have their flux set to NaN to exclude them from
                further processing. If you want to keep all sources with zero
                PSF model, then make sure none are excluded from shape fitting.

            initial_aperture (float):
                This aperture is used to derive an initial guess for the
                amplitudes of sources when fitting for a piecewise bicubic PSF
                model by doing aperture photometry assuming a perfectly flat
                PSF.

            subpixmap (2D numpy array):
                The sub-pixel map, for PSF fitting only.

            smoothing (float):
                How much smoothing penalty to impose when fitting the PSF.
                ``None`` for no smoothing. Value can be both positive and
                negative and will always result in smoothing (less for negative
                values).

            max_chi2 (float):
                The value of the reduced chi squared above which sources are
                excluded from the fit. This can indicate non-point sources or
                sources for which the location is wrong among ohter things.

            pixel_rejection_threshold (float):
                A number defining individual pixels to exclude from the PSF fit.
                Pixels with fitting residuals (normalized by the standard
                deviation) bigger than this value are excluded. If zero, no
                pixels are rejected.

            max_abs_amplitude_change (float):
                The absolute root of sum squares tolerance of the source
                amplitude changes in order to declare the piecewise bicubic PSF
                fitting converged.

            max_rel_amplitude_change (float):
                The relative root of sum squares tolerance of the source
                amplitude changes in order to declare the piecewise bicubic PSF
                fitting converged.

            min_convergence_rate (float):
                If the rate of convergence falls below this threshold,
                iterations are stopped. The rate is calculated as the fractional
                decrease in the difference between the amplitude change and the
                value when it would stop, as determined by the
                :attr:`max_abs_amplitude_change` and
                :attr:`max_rel_amplitude_change` attributes.

            max_iterations (int):
                No more than this number if iterations will be performed. If
                convergence is not achieved before then, the latest estimates
                are output and an exception is thrown. A negative value allows
                infinite iterations. A value of zero, along with an initial
                guess for the PSF causes only the amplitudes to be fit for PSF
                fitting photometry with a known PSF. It is an error to pass a
                value of zero for this option and not specify and initial guess
                for the PSF.

            gain (float):
                The gain in electrons per ADU to assume for the input images.

            cover_grid (bool):
                If this option is true, all pixels that at least partially
                overlap with the grid are assigned to the corresponding source.
                This option is ignored for sdk PSF models.

            src_min_signal_to_noise (float):
                How far above the background (in units of RMS) should pixels be
                to still be considered part of a source. Ignored if the
                piecewise bibucic PSF grid is used to select source pixels
                (cover-bicubic-grid option).

            src_max_aperture (float):
                If this option has a positive value, pixels are assigned to
                sources in circular apertures (the smallest such that all pixels
                that pass the signal to noise cut are still assigned to the
                source). If an aperture larger than this value is required, an
                exception is thrown.

            src_max_sat_frac (float):
                If more than this fraction of the pixels assigned to a source
                are saturated, the source is excluded from the fit.

            src_min_pix (int):
                The minimum number of pixels that must be assigned to a source
                in order to include the source is the PSF fit.

            src_max_pix (int):
                The maximum number of pixels that car be assigned to a source
                before excluding the source from the PSF fit.

            src_max_count (int):
                The maximum number of sources to include in the fit for the PSF
                shape. The rest of the sources get their amplitudes fit and are
                used to determine the overlaps. Sources are ranked according to
                the sum of (background excess)^2/(pixel variance+background
                variance) of their individual non-saturated pixels.

            bg_min_pix (int):
                The minimum number of pixels a background estimate must be based
                on in order to include the source in shape fitting.

            magnitude_1adu (float):
                The magnitude that corresponds to a flux of 1ADU.


    Example:
        Create and configure a PRF fitting object, allowing up to third order
        dependence on image position, on a grid which splits the area around the
        source in 16 squares of 2pix by 2pix size each and using an aperture
        with 5 pixel radius for the initial estimate of source amplitudes:

        >>> from astrowisp import FitStarShape
        >>> fitprf = FitStarShape(mode='prf',
        >>>                       grid=[-4.0, -2.0, 0.0, 2.0, 4.0],
        >>>                       initial_aperture=5.0)
