"""
Unit tests for connection pool exhaustion scenarios.

Tests how the async wrapper handles:
- Pool exhaustion under high load
- Connection borrowing timeouts
- Pool recovery after exhaustion
- Connection health checks

Test Organization:
==================
1. Pool Exhaustion - Running out of connections
2. Borrowing Timeouts - Waiting for available connections
3. Recovery - Pool recovering after exhaustion
4. Health Checks - Connection health monitoring
5. Metrics - Tracking pool usage and exhaustion
6. Graceful Degradation - Prioritizing critical queries

Key Testing Principles:
======================
- Simulate realistic pool limits
- Test concurrent access patterns
- Verify recovery mechanisms
- Track exhaustion metrics
