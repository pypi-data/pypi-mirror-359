# If your package directory is just 'aurite' directly under 'src/'
# and 'src' itself is not part of the package name installed in site-packages,
# then py.typed should be in 'src/aurite/py.typed'.
# The [tool.setuptools.packages.find] where = ["src"] include = ["aurite*"]
# and package_dir = {"" = "src"} in pyproject.toml ensures 'src/aurite'
# is treated as the 'aurite' package.
