Introduction
============

This software manual details the installation instructions, usage guidelines, and example code snippets needed to confidently use the available models.
The current models focus exclusively on slags and can be employed to estimate molar volume, density, electrical conductivity, diffusivity and viscosity.

All current models have classes for unary, binary and multicomponent systems.
Generally, each of these model classes, irrespective of the physical property, functions in the same way.
We will therefore first give a holistic description of the three class types in :ref:`slag-mpp-model-implementation`, and then attend to the specific models of :ref:`density`, :ref:`molar-volume`, :ref:`electrical-conductivity`, :ref:`diffusivity`, and :ref:`viscosity`.
