Supplementary Examples
======================

This section provides additional examples and guides on how to set up and use ``auxi-mpp`` models, particularly focusing on the :term:`BFF` required for binary and multicomponent models.


Bond Fraction Function Example
------------------------------

All binary and multi component models require the user to provide a :term:`BFF`.
Here we provide a condensed guide on how to set up a :term:`BFF` that implements `ChemApp for Python <https://python.gtt-technologies.de/doc/chemapp/main.html#>`_.
