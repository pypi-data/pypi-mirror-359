            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Bagz

## Overview

*Bagz* is a format for storing a sequence of byte-array records, typically
serialised protocol buffers. It supports per-record compression and fast
index-based lookup. All indexing is zero based.

## Installation

To install Bagz from source we recommend using
[uv] (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). The install will download required
dependencies apart from curl (`libcurl-devel`) and OpenSSL (`openssl-devel`).
These need to be installed in a location that cmake's `find_package` searches.

```sh
uv pip install .
```

## Python API

### Python Reader

Reader for reading a single or sharded Bagz file-set.

```python
from collections.abc import Sequence, Iterable

import bagz
import numpy as np

# Bagz Readers support random access. The order of elements within a Bagz
# file is the order in which they are written. Records are returned as `bytes`
# objects.
data = bagz.Reader('/path/to/data.bagz')

# Bagz Readers can be configured like this - here we require that the file was
# written with separate limits.
data_separate_limits = bagz.Reader('/path/to/data.bagz', bagz.Reader.Options(
    limits_placement=bagz.LimitsPlacement.SEPARATE,
))

# Bagz Readers are Sequences and support slicing, iterating, etc.
assert isinstance(data, Sequence)

# Bagz Readers have a length.
assert len(data) > 10

# Can access record by row-index.
fifth_value: bytes = data[5]

# Can slice.
data_from_5: bagz.Reader = data[5:]

# Slices are still Readers.
assert isinstance(data_from_5, bagz.Reader)

assert data_from_5[0] == fifth_value

# Can access records by multiple row-indices.
fourth, second, tenth = data.read_indices([4, 2, 10])
assert fourth == data[4]
assert second == data[2]
assert tenth == data[10]

# Can iterate records.
for record in data:
  do_something_else(record)

# Can read all records. This eager version can be faster than iteration.
all_records = data.read()

# Can iterate sub-range of records.
for record in data[4:9]:
  do_something_else(record)

# Can read a sub-range of records. This eager form can be faster than
# iteration.
sub_range = data[4:9].read()

# Can use an infinite iterator as source of indices. (Reads ahead in parallel.)
def my_generator(size: int) -> Iterable[int]:
  rng = np.random.default_rng(42)
  while True:
    yield rng.integers(size).item()

data_iter: Iterable[bytes] = data.read_indices_iter(my_generator(len(data)))
for i in range(10):
  random_item: bytes = next(data_iter)
```

#### Python Reader - `Index` and `MultiIndex`

You can use `Index` to find the first index of a record and `MultiIndex` to find
all instances of an item.

```python
keys = bagz.Reader('/path/to/keys.bag')
# Get the index of the first occurrence of key.
index = bagz.Index(keys)
key_index: int = index[b'example_key']

# Get all occurrences of key.
multi_index = bagz.MultiIndex(keys)
all_indices: list[int] = multi_index[b'example_key']
```

### Python Writer

For writing a single Bagz file.

Example:

```python
import bagz

# Compression is selected based on the file extension:
# `.bagz` will use Zstandard compression with default settings.
# `.bag` will use no compression.
with bagz.Writer('/path/to/data.bagz') as writer:
  for d in generate_records():
    writer.write(d)

# Adjust compression level explicitly.
# Note this will no longer use the extension to detemine whether to compress.
with bagz.Writer(
    '/path/to/data.bagz',
    bagz.Writer.Options(
        compression=bagz.CompressionZstd(level=3)
    ),
) as writer:
  for d in generate_records():
    writer.write(d)
```

## Options

### Reader Options

`bagz.Reader.Options` has these optional arguments.

*   `compression`: Can be one of:
    *   `bagz.CompressionAutoDetect()`: Default - Uses extension whether to
        compress. (`.bagz` - Compressed (ZStandard), `.bag` - Uncompressed)
    *   `bagz.CompressionNone()`: Records are not decompressed.
    *   `bagz.CompressionZstd()`: Records are decompressed using Zstandard.
*   `limits_placement`: Can be one of:
    *   `bagz.LimitsPlacement.TAIL`: Default- Reads limits from a tail of file.
    *   `bagz.LimitsPlacement.SEPARATE`: Reads limits from a separate file.
*   `limits_storage`: Can be one of:
    *   `bagz.LimitsStorage.ON_DISK`: Default - Reads limits from disk for each
        read.
    *   `bagz.LimitsStorage.IN_MEMORY`: Reads all limits from disk in one go.
*   `max_parallelism`: Default number of threads when reading many records.
*   `sharding_layout`: Can be one of:
    *   `bagz.ShardingLayout.CONCATENATED`: Default - See [Sharding](#sharding)
    *   `bagz.ShardingLayout.INTERLEAVED`: See [Sharding](#sharding)

### Writer Options

`bagz.Writer.Options` has these optional arguments.

*   `compression`: Can be one of:
    *   `bagz.CompressionAutoDetect()`: Default - Uses extension whether to
        compress. (`.bagz` - Compressed (Zstandard), `.bag` - Uncompressed)
    *   `bagz.CompressionNone()`: Records are not compressed.
    *   `bagz.CompressionZstd(level = 3)`: Records are compressed using
        Zstandard the level of the compression can be specified.
*   `limits_placement`: Can be one of:
    *   `bagz.LimitsPlacement.TAIL`: Default - Writes limits to a tail of file.
    *   `bagz.LimitsPlacement.SEPARATE`: Writes limits to a separate file.

## GCS Support

Bagz supports Posix file-systems and Google Cloud Storage (GCS). If you have
files on GCS you can access them with using the prefix `/gs:` to the path.
These examples assume you have gcloud CLI installed.

From the shell:

```sh
gcloud config set project your-project-name
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Then use the 'gs:' file-system prefix.

```python
import pathlib
import bagz

# (This may freeze if you have not configured the project.)
reader = bagz.Reader('gs://your-bucket-name/your-file.bagz')

# Path supports a leading slash to work well with pathlib.
bucket = pathlib.Path('/gs://your-bucket-name')
reader = bagz.Reader(bucket / 'your-file.bagz')
```

## Sharding

An ordered collection of Bagz-formatted files ("shards") may be opened together
and indexed via a single `global-index`. The `global-index` is mapped to a
`shard` and an index within that shard (`shard-index`) in one of two ways:

1.  **Concatenated** (default). Indexing is equivalent to the records in each
    Bagz-formatted shard being concatenated into a single sequence of records.

    Example:

    When opening four Bagz-formatted files with sizes `[8, 4, 0, 5]`, the
    `global-index` with range `[0, 17)` (shown as the table entries) maps to
    `shard` and `shard-index` like this:

    ```
                   | shard-index
    shard          |  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
    -------------- | -----------------------
    00000-of-00004 |  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
    00001-of-00004 |  8  9 10 11
    00002-of-00004 |
    00003-of-00004 | 12 13 14 15 16
    ```

    Mappings

    `global-index` | `shard`          | `shard-index`
    -------------: | :--------------: | -------------
    `0`            | `00000-of-00004` | `0`
    `1`            | `00000-of-00004` | `1`
    `2`            | `00000-of-00004` | `2`
    ...            | ...              | ...
    `8`            | `00001-of-00004` | `0`
    `9`            | `00001-of-00004` | `1`
    ...            | ...              | ...
    `15`           | `00003-of-00004` | `3`
    `16`           | `00003-of-00004` | `4`

2.  **Interleaved** where the global-index is interleaved in a round-robin
    manner across all the shards.

    Example:

    When opening three Bagz-formatted files with sizes `[6, 6, 5]`, the
    `global-index` with range `[0, 17)` (shown as the table entries) maps to
    `shard` and `shard-index` like this:

    ```
                   |  shard-index
    shard          |  0  1  2  3  4  5
    -------------- | -----------------
    00000-of-00003 |  0  3  6  9 12 15
    00001-of-00003 |  1  4  7 10 13 16
    00002-of-00003 |  2  5  8 11 14
    ```

    Mappings

    `global-index` | `shard`          | `shard-index`
    -------------: | :--------------: | -------------
    `0`            | `00000-of-00003` | `0`
    `1`            | `00001-of-00003` | `0`
    `2`            | `00002-of-00003` | `0`
    ...            | ...              | ...
    `6`            | `00000-of-00003` | `2`
    `7`            | `00001-of-00003` | `2`
    `8`            | `00002-of-00003` | `2`
    ...            | ...              | ...
    `15`           | `00000-of-00003` | `5`
    `16`           | `00001-of-00003` | `5`

## Bagz file format

The Bagz file format has two parts: the `records` section and the `limits`
section.

*   The `records` section consists of the concatenation of all (possibly
    compressed) records. (There are no additional bytes inside or between
    records, and records are not aligned in any way.)
*   The `limits` section is a dense array of the end-offsets of each record in
    order, encoded in little-endian 64-bit unsigned integers.

These can be stored with *tail-limits* in one file, where the `limits` sections
is appended to the `record` section or *separate-limits* where they are stored
in separate files.

### Tail-limits example

Given Bagz file formatted file with the following 3 uncompressed records:

Records  |
-------- |
`abcdef` |
`123`    |
`catcat` |

The raw bytes of the Bagz file formated file corresponding to the records above:

```
0x61 a 0x62 b 0x63 c 0x64 d 0x65 e 0x66 f
0x31 1 0x32 2 0x33 3
0x63 c 0x61 a 0x74 t 0x63 c 0x61 a 0x74 t
0x06   0x00   0x00   0x00   0x00   0x00   0x00   0x00  # 6 byte offset
0x09   0x00   0x00   0x00   0x00   0x00   0x00   0x00  # 9 byte offset
0x0f   0x00   0x00   0x00   0x00   0x00   0x00   0x00  # 15 byte offset
```

The last 8 bytes represent the end-offset of the last record. This is also the
start of the `limits` section. Therefore reading the last 8 bytes will directly
tell you the offset of the `records`/`limits` boundary.
