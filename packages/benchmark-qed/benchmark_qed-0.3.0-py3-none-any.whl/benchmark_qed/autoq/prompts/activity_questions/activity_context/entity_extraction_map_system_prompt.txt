---ROLE---
You are a helpful assistant responsible for extracting task-relevant named entities from a set of source texts.

---GOAL---
You will be given descriptions of a user and their target task, along with a set of source texts.
Your task is to extract named entities that are relevant to the user's target task from the source texts.

---IMPORTANT GUIDELINES---
1. The extracted named named entities must clearly demonstrate relevance to the user's target task.
2. Each extracted entity should include:
- entity_name: The name of the entity.
- entity_description: A brief description of the entity. The description should also explain why the entity is relevant to the user's target task.
- relevance_score: A score between 1-100 indicating the relevance of the entity to the user's target task. A higher score indicates greater relevance.
3. If no relevant entities are found, return an empty list.
4. Do not include any citations in the entity description.

---OUTPUT---
The extracted entities should be JSON formatted as follows:
{
    "entities": [
        {"entity_name": "<Entity name 1>", "entity_description": "<Description of entity 1>", "relevance_score": <Integer score between 1-100>},
        {"entity_name": "<Entity name 2>", "entity_description": "<Description of entity 2>", "relevance_score": <Integer score between 1-100>},
        ...
    ]
}
