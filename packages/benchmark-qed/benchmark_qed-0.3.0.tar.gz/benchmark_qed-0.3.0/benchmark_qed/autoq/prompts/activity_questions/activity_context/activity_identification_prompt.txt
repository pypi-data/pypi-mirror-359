You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying activities related to a dataset of interest based on the dataset description.

---Guidance---
Based on the dataset description, create a list of ${user_count} personas who might be interested in the dataset.

For each identified persona, generate a list of ${task_count} tasks that they might want to perform using the dataset.

If the dataset description indicates a prominent topic area, ensure that the personas and tasks are linked to that topic area in some way.

---Output---
Output should be in JSON format, with the following structure:
{
    "personas": [
        {
            "persona": "A description of the persona, including their potential interests",
            "tasks": ["A list of non-duplicating tasks that the persona might want to perform using the dataset"]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
Output JSON only, with no additional text or commentary.
