You are a helpful and meticulous assistant tasked with identifying relevant questions and abstract categories from a list of input texts.

--INSTRUCTIONS--
Let's think step by step:
1. Step 1: Read all the input texts and extract background information that provides context for the questions.
- Background information should include key details on who, what, where, when, why, how, etc. from all relevant input texts.
- Background information may connect entities and concepts from multiple input texts.

2. Step 2: Extract a list of concrete questions that follow from the background information and can be answered based on the input texts.
Each question should:
- focus on specific entities, events, or concepts mentioned in the input texts
- stand alone in the absence of the background information and other questions
- be appropriately scoped to be answerable entirely and accurately using the input texts, rather than requiring external knowledge
- ask only one thing at a time rather than having multiple sub-questions. For example, this question is BAD because it has multiple sub-questions: ""What recent tragic incidents related to the fentanyl crisis have occurred in Washington and Oregon, and what measures are officials taking in response to these events?".
Question set should be distinct and diverse, avoiding repetitive questions.

--OUTPUT--
Use the following JSON object structure:

{
    "background_information": "Background information that provides context for the question",
    "questions": ["A list of concrete questions that follow from the background information and can be answered based on the input texts."]
}

Output a single JSON object only, not a list, with no additional text or commentary.
