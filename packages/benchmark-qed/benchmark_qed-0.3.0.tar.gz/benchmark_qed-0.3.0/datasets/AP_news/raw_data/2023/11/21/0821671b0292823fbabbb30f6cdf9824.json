    "description_summary": "The Missouri Supreme Court has turned away an appeal about how to word a ballot question on access to abortion. The state\u2019s Republican secretary of state has suggested wording that would ask voters whether they are in favor of allowing \u201cdangerous and unregulated abortions until live birth.\u201d A state appeals court in October said the wording was politically partisan. Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft appealed the decision, but on Monday the Missouri Supreme Court declined to hear his argument. The Missouri Legislature has already banned most abortions in the state, but proponents of access to the procedure are seeking to put the policy decision directly before voters.",

In all seven states where abortion has been <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-abortion-us-supreme-court-health-michigan-23bfba4a07de57b175d9de1281ecace6\">on the ballot</a> since the U.S. Supreme Court <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0\">struck down Roe v. Wade</a> last year, voters have either supported protecting abortion rights or rejected attempts to erode them.</p><p>In Missouri, officials and advocates on both sides are grappling with <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/missouri-abortion-68362de7c0c0f6344543308ec4569b5b\">how to word the question</a> that could go on the ballot. Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft has proposed asking voters whether they are in favor of allowing \u201cdangerous and unregulated abortions until live birth.\u201d</p><p>A state appeals court in October <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-missouri-ballot-constitution-ruling-edb5f44fc0f9799d01cda22cd1f70b40\">said the wording was politically partisan</a>. Ashcroft appealed the decision, but on Monday the Missouri Supreme Court declined to hear his argument.</p><p>Summaries are used on Missouri ballots to help voters understand sometimes lengthy and complex constitutional amendments and other ballot proposals. Ashcroft, who is running for governor in 2024, said his wording \u201cfairly and accurately reflects the scope and magnitude\" of each of the six proposed abortion rights ballot measures.</p><p>\u201cMy responsibility as secretary of state is to make sure the people of Missouri have ballot language that they can understand and trust,\" Ashcroft said in a news release. \"If these petitions make it to the ballot, the people will decide. I will continue to do everything in my power to make sure Missourians know the truth.\u201d</p><p>A statement from the ACLU of Missouri said the \u201crepeated rejection of the Secretary of State\u2019s arguments verify that his case has no legal bearing.\"</p><p>Ashcroft is the son of John Ashcroft, a former governor, U.S. senator and U.S. attorney general under President George W. Bush. Jay Ashcroft is among four Republicans who have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/governor-missouri-ashcroft-election-republican-cceea45c2a7369a9ec37ea85ec6998c6\">announced their candidacies</a> for governor next year.</p><p>Ashcroft\u2019s original description of the proposed abortion amendments, which could go on the ballot in 2024 if supporters gather enough voter signatures, would have asked voters whether they want to \u201callow for dangerous, unregulated, and unrestricted abortions, from conception to live birth, without requiring a medical license or potentially being subject to medical malpractice.\u201d</p><p>In October, an appeals court panel wrote that allowing unrestricted abortion \u201cduring all nine months of pregnancy is not a probable effect of initiatives.\u201d The panel largely upheld summaries that were written by a lower court judge to be more impartial.</p><p>Those summaries would tell voters the amendments would \u201cestablish a right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraceptives\u201d and \u201cremove Missouri\u2019s ban on abortion.\u201d</p><p>Missouri's current law makes most abortion a felony punishable by five to 15 years in prison for anyone who performs or induces one. Medical professionals who do so also could lose their licenses. The law prohibits women who undergo abortions from being prosecuted.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ohio-abortion-amendment-election-2023-fe3e06747b616507d8ca21ea26485270\">Ohio voters approved</a> a constitutional amendment that ensures access to abortion and other forms of reproductive health care.</p><p>Measures to protect abortion access will be on 2024 ballots in Maryland and New York. Legislative efforts or petition drives are underway in a variety of other states. There are efforts to protect or expand access in Arizona, Florida, Nevada and South Dakota; and to restrict it in Iowa, Nebraska and Pennsylvania. Drives are on for both kinds of measures in Colorado.</p>",
