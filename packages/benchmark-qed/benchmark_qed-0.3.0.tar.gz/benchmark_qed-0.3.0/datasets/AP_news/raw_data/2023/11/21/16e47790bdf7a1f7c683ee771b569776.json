The bills filed Monday also include a proposal to speed up an increase in the state\u2019s minimum wage and a measure that would automatically restore the rights of convicted felons who have completed their sentences. Bills filed in both the House and Senate would make buying, selling or transferring an assault firearm a Class 1 misdemeanor, subject to up to 12 months in jail. The state Senate passed a similar bill earlier this year, but it died in the House, which was then controlled by Republicans.",

The amendments would then need to pass the legislature during a second year and then be put to voters for approval in a state referendum.</p><p>Del. Charniele Herring, who is sponsoring the House resolution to protect abortion access, said it's become \u201call too clear that without constitutional protection, access to reproductive health care is at risk.\u201d</p><p>Bills filed in both the House and Senate would make buying, selling or transferring an assault firearm a Class 1 misdemeanor, subject to up to 12 months in jail.

While the topic of abortion access is relevant to health, the document primarily focuses on legislative actions and political processes rather than health itself. The other topics mentioned (assault weapons, minimum wage, and felons' rights) are not related to health. Therefore, the document has some relevance to health but is not primarily focused on it."
