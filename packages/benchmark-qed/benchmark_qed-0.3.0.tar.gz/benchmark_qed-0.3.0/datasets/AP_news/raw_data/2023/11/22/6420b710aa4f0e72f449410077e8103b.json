Truvada is manufactured by U.S.-based Gilead Sciences Inc., which in January warned that millions of dollars\u2019 worth of fake versions of its HIV drugs were being sold in the U.S., posing dangers to patients. But their discovery in Kenya, East Africa\u2019s commercial hub, shows the herculean task of tackling fake medicines.",
