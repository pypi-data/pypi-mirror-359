    "description_summary": "Physicians and the former, sole abortion provider in North Dakota are asking a state district court judge to block enforcement of part of a revised law that bans most abortions. In the request filed Tuesday, they argue a provision that allows the procedure to protect a woman\u2019s health is too vague. Earlier this year, the Republican-led Legislature overwhelmingly passed a bill that essentially revised the state's abortion laws. They did so in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision striking down the constitutional right to an abortion. Republican Gov. Doug Burgum signed the bill into law in April.",

(AP) \u2014 Physicians and the former, sole abortion provider in North Dakota on Tuesday asked a judge to block enforcement of part of a revised law that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-north-dakota-ban-exceptions-da5a7b70eb8757cb563529881f3c4b40\">bans most abortions,</a> saying a provision that allows the procedure to protect a woman\u2019s health is too vague.</p><p>North Dakota outlaws all abortions, except in cases where women could face death or a \u201cserious health risk.\u201d People who perform abortions could be charged with a felony under the law, but patients would not.</p><p>Tuesday\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction asks the state district court judge to bar the state from enforcing the law against physicians who use their \u201cgood-faith medical judgment\u201d to perform an abortion to treat pregnancy complications that could \u201cpose a risk of infection, hemorrhage, high blood pressure, or which otherwise makes continuing a pregnancy unsafe.\u201d</p><p>The doctors and clinic are asking the injunction to remain in place until their suit against the full law goes to trial next year.</p><p>Physicians have perceived the law's language for \u201cserious health risk\u201d to be \u201cso vague\u201d that they \u201cdon't know at what point a condition rises to the level of being what the statute calls a \u2018serious health risk,\u2019\u201d Center for Reproductive Rights attorney Meetra Mehdizadeh told The Associated Press.</p><p>\u201cPhysicians want to be able to provide treatment for their patients before their health declines and before they experience serious and potentially life-threatening complications,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause of the restrictions placed on abortion access in North Dakota, they don\u2019t know whether they can do that legally.\u201d</p><p>The state's revised abortion law also provides an exception for pregnancies caused by rape and incest, but only in the first six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. It also allows for treatment of ectopic and molar pregnancies, which are nonviable situations.</p><p>The Red River Women\u2019s Clinic sued the state last year after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision, which overturned the court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling establishing a nationwide right to abortion. The lawsuit targeted the state\u2019s since-repealed trigger ban \u2014 a ban designed to go into effect immediately if the court overturned Roe v. Wade \u2014 as unconstitutional. The clinic <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-minnesota-north-dakota-fargo-1a9bd7e83d5e8f213adf81d3109112a4\">moved last year</a> from Fargo, North Dakota, to neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota, where abortion remains legal.</p><p>A judge <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-lawsuits-north-dakota-fargo-8fc7f3f915e75de78ac964a1b12b9893\">granted a preliminary injunction</a> blocking the ban from taking effect last year, which the state Supreme Court <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ban-north-dakota-0259418f32b3f56432b0b8f5c880ff7e\">upheld in March</a>. In April, the Republican-led Legislature overwhelmingly passed a bill revising the state's abortion law.</p><p>Republican Gov. Doug <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-north-dakota-six-week-ban-2bccde2925d30dd4772aaed84f3c2d98\">Burgum signed that bill</a> into law in late April. In June, the clinic <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ban-north-dakota-lawsuit-749f9be3f8dcc2906fd6fc3a988be9f3\">filed an amended complaint,</a> joined by several doctors in obstetrics, gynecology and maternal-fetal medicine. A jury trial is scheduled for August 2024.</p><p>Chief Justice Jon Jensen wrote <a href=\"https://www.ndcourts.gov/supreme-court/opinion/2023ND50\">in the court's March decision</a> that \u201cit is clear the citizens of North Dakota have a right to enjoy and defend life and a right to pursue and obtain safety, which necessarily includes a pregnant woman has a fundamental right to obtain an abortion to preserve her life or her health.\u201d</p><p>Republican state Sen. Janne Myrdal, who sponsored <a href=\"https://www.ndlegis.gov/assembly/68-2023/regular/documents/23-0137-08000.pdf\">the bill,</a> called Tuesday's filing \u201csad\" and said it could have come earlier.</p><p>\u201cWe can do a lot better in North Dakota than what these people who are suing us are intending to do, so we're going to stand firm and continue to protect life,\u201d she told the AP.</p><p>The Associated Press sent a text message to North Dakota Republican Attorney General Drew Wrigley seeking comment.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Kimberlee Kruesi in Nashville, Tennessee, contributed to this report.</p>",
