The request from Rome prosecutors essentially closes the investigation without any charges. The investigation had focused on whether delayed lockdowns and Italy's overall preparedness contributed to the toll. Already prosecutors had closed their case without filing charges against three of Italy\u2019s past health ministers. On Thursday, they asked a judge to archive the case against nine other officials, including a former top official at the World Health Organization, Dr. Ranieri Guerra.",

WHO said it was pulled because it contained inaccuracies and was published prematurely.</p><p>Guerra had been the former head of the department of prevention in the Italian health ministry until 2017 and was a WHO envoy to Italy during the pandemic.
