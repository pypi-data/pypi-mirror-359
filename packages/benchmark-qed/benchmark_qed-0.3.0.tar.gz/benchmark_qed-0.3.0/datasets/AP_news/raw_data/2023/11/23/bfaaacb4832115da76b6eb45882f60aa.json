Russell ruled on Tuesday that a proposed ballot initiative offered by abortion rights advocates in the western swing state is too broad. Abortion rights have become a mobilizing issue for Democrats after the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade, which established a nationwide right to abortion. The proposed Nevada petition would have have enshrined the \u201cfundamental right to reproductive freedom\u201d which includes prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, birth control, vasectomy, tubal ligation, abortion and abortion care into the state constitution.",

(AP) \u2014 A judge has struck down an effort to enshrine reproductive rights, including abortion, in Nevada\u2019s constitution, as abortion rights advocates in the western swing state attempt to follow other states in putting the question before voters in 2024.</p><p>Judge James T. Russell in Carson City District Court concluded on Tuesday that the proposed ballot initiative is too broad, contains a \u201cmisleading description of effect\u201d and has an unfunded mandate.</p><p>The petition, if passed by voters, would have amended the state constitution to include the \u201cfundamental right to reproductive freedom,\u201d including prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, birth control, vasectomy, tubal ligation, abortion and abortion care.</p><p>\u201cThis is probably the clearest case I have seen that I think there is a violation of the single-subject rule,\u201d Russell said on Tuesday, according to KOLO-TV Reno, which <a href=\"https://www.kolotv.com/2023/11/22/nevada-judge-strikes-down-reproductive-rights-initiative-petition/\">first reported</a> the ruling. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of them over the years and in respect to this particular matter, there are too many subjects. Not all of which are functionally related to each other.\u201d</p><p>Russell, the son of former Republican Gov. Charles Russell, was appointed to the bench in January 2007 by moderate Republican Gov. Kenny Guinn. He <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-nevada-11ad69318d4a6025ab3f167fd3be9c76\">was threatened</a> after dismissing a lawsuit brought by former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign seeking to nullify President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s electoral win in Nevada.</p><p>The political action committee Nevadans for Reproductive Rights filed the petition to enshrine reproduction rights in the constitution with the Nevada Secretary of State's office on Sept. 14.</p><p>On Oct. 5, the Coalition for Parents and Children PAC filed a complaint with the court challenging the petition's legality. If allowed to proceed, Nevadans for Reproductive Rights would need just over 100,000 signatures to get the issue on the ballot.</p><p>Asked about a possible appeal to the Nevada Supreme Court, Nevadans for Reproductive Rights attorney Bradley Schrager said the group is \u201cconsidering its options.\u201d</p><p>Nevadans for Reproductive Rights president Lindsay Harmon said the group \u201cwill not let one judge\u2019s misguided ruling deter us from giving Nevadans the opportunity to vote to permanently protect their reproductive rights in the Nevada Constitution.\u201d</p><p>Jason Guinasso, an attorney for the Coalition for Parents and Children PAC, said he was happy with the ruling but expected the other side to appeal.</p><p>Abortion rights have become a mobilizing issue for Democrats since the U.S. Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 court decision establishing a nationwide right to abortion.</p><p>Earlier this month, Ohio <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ohio-abortion-amendment-election-2023-fe3e06747b616507d8ca21ea26485270\">became the seventh state</a> in which voters decided to protect abortion access.</p><p>Meanwhile, constitutional amendments protecting abortion access are already set to appear on the 2024 ballot in New York and Maryland, and could also show up in a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ballot-measure-2024-state-vote-e7d635835dc3a440789ad87787553ec1\">host of other states</a>, including <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/missouri-abortion-ballot-measure-wording-0821671b0292823fbabbb30f6cdf9824\">Missouri</a> and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-arizona-ballot-voters-2024-a7ea711840cbe2103a9c75c4c4dd4ef3\">neighboring Arizona.</a></p><p>Advocates on both sides of the issue are trying to get questions about abortion access on the ballot in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ballot-measure-2024-state-vote-e7d635835dc3a440789ad87787553ec1\">at least a dozen states</a> across the country.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-poll-roe-dobbs-ban-opinion-fcfdfc5a799ac3be617d99999e92eabe\">Public polling shows</a> about two-thirds of Americans say abortion should generally be legal in the earliest stages of pregnancy. Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade in June 2022, that sentiment has been underscored in elections both in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-abortion-us-supreme-court-health-michigan-23bfba4a07de57b175d9de1281ecace6\">Democratic and deeply Republican states</a>.</p><p>Abortion rights up to 24 weeks are already codified into Nevada law through a 1990 referendum vote, where two-thirds of voters were in favor.
