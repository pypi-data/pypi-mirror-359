    "description_summary": "When Daniel Skousen scrubs at the ash and soot covering his Maui home, he worries about the smell. More specifically, he worries about what chemicals created the burning-trash-barrel scent that has lingered since a deadly wildfire tore through Lahaina in August. He wants an independent expert to check the environmental safety testing being done by government agencies, but so far he hasn't been able to get the raw data. Environmental Epidemiologist Irva Hertz-Picciotto studies the health effects of such fires. She says there's a lot that scientists don't yet know about the long-term health impacts of wildfires like the one that destroyed Lahaina.",

Nearly 7,000 were <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hawaii-maui-wildfires-lahaina-housing-5a43b95a20e17dd3679c6ebc580994c7\">still in short-term lodging</a> two months later.</p><p>The rubble left behind includes electrical cables, plastic pipes and vehicle tires that emit dangerous dioxins when burned; lead from melted vehicles or old house paint; and arsenic-laden ash from termite-resistant building materials.</p><p>After a major wildfire <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/marshall-fire-colorado-cause-91aad87da67fd883b9294df1ff386865\">burned 1,000 homes</a> in Boulder County, Colorado, in 2021, health officials learned that even professionally remediated homes were often still polluted with ash, char and other toxic substances long <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wildfires-fires-colorado-denver-ad43bbca5cd0f099740a9a66d783c29c\">after the fire</a>, said Bill Hayes, the county's air quality program coordinator.</p><p>The reason? High winds \u2014 like those that plagued Maui during the wildfire this summer \u2014 forced fine particulate matter into every crevice, Hayes said. Those particulates would sit inside window panes, behind light switches, between shingles and elsewhere until the winds started up again, re-contaminating the home.</p><p>\u201cChar is a carcinogen, so we don\u2019t ever say any level of those particulates are safe,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThat became a challenge in the cleanup \u2013 determining the level of when is it clean enough?\u201d</p><p>State and federal agencies have released regular updates on Lahaina\u2019s relative safety. The water in much of the town is still unsafe to drink, and visitors have been advised to use protective gear in impacted areas. Officials say pregnant people and kids should stay out of the burn zone, though the Hawaii Department of Education says the schools, which are above the burned part of town, are safe.</p><p>Crews have installed air quality monitors throughout town and are spraying a soil sealant to prevent toxic ash from being washed into the ocean or blowing around.</p><p>An attorney representing Skousen and about two dozen other Lahaina residents sent a public records request to the Environmental Protection Agency last month asking for all records regarding residential testing of contaminants in Lahaina and their impact to human health.</p><p>The EPA's reply, sent earlier this month, wasn't reassuring: \u201cNo records could be located that are responsive to your request.\u201d</p><p>EPA spokesman Kellen Ashford told The Associated Press his agency did some <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hawaii-maui-fires-epa-corp-of-engineers-landfills-a6e5d44293af87e957893dc42cb86621\">environmental hazard testing</a> in the burn zone, but only to determine the immediate risk for workers involved in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hawaii-maui-lahaina-wildfire-landfill-memorial-b93d8e193911a7e6bca91618f1650d2c\">the initial cleanup</a>.</p><p>He referred further questions about such testing to the Hawaii Department of Health, which he said was responsible for determining longer-term safety for residents.</p><p>The Hawaii Department of Health's Environmental Health Services Division also told Skousen's attorney it had no records about residential testing of contaminants to release.</p><p>The Health Department declined interview requests. Spokesman Shawn Hamamoto said in an email the department will pursue additional air quality and ash testing when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers begins removing debris from Lahaina.</p><p>\u201cI think that they're playing \u2018hide the ball,\u2019\u201d said Skousen's attorney, Edward Neiger. \u201cThe question is, why do they feel the need to hide anything?\u201d</p><p>Ashford acknowledged some residents are skeptical of the cleanup efforts. He said the EPA has people stationed at the Lahaina Civic Center and at work sites to talk to community members about their concerns.</p><p>Andrew Shoemaker, a fine art photographer who operated a gallery on Lahaina\u2019s famous Front Street, believes it's an important part of healing to go back to the burned areas to see what is left, but he has recently had a lung infection and doesn't want to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfire-smoke-832caae1e622b10766521598fccc6e63\">risk his health</a>.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even want to take the chance of going over there,\u201d he said.</p><p>Dioxins, toxic compounds that can be released when plastic pipes, tires and other household materials are burned, are a particular concern for Shoemaker. Dioxins can last for decades inside the human body, and can cause reproductive and developmental problems, damage the immune system, interfere with hormones and cause cancer, according to the World Health Organization.</p><p>The EPA has found that forest fires and household trash burning in backyard burn barrels \u2014 how Skousen now describes the scent of Lahaina \u2014 are both major sources of dioxin emissions.</p><p>Irva Hertz-Picciotto, a professor and environmental epidemiologist with University of California-Davis, said the air monitors are effective and can measure particles that are about 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair.</p><p>Still, there is a lot that scientists don\u2019t yet know about the long-term health risks posed by fires, Hertz-Picciotto said.</p><p>That post-fire smell noticed by Skousen can be a result of off-gassing, she said, which occurs when volatile organic compounds are absorbed into surfaces and released later.</p><p>Even with careful air quality monitoring, off-gassing can expose residents and cleanup workers to toxic fire emissions for months, and research shows only some volatile organic compounds can be trapped by high-quality air particle filters, according to the <a href=\"https://cires.colorado.edu/news/how-mitigate-post-fire-smoke-impacts-your-home\">Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences</a> at the University of Colorado Boulder.</p><p>\u201cIf it smells like burned plastic or burned electrical cables, then probably those chemicals are in the air and not healthy,\u201d Hertz-Picciotto said. \u201cThe other side of that, though, is even if you can\u2019t smell it, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>Skousen is a teacher and runs a cleaning business on the side. He\u2019s spent his off hours in Lahaina working on cleaning his and his neighbors\u2019 homes. Skousen and his wife decided to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/maui-lahaina-fire-schools-reopen-eb727f3d5e7345d098777708071716bb\">homeschool their kids</a> at their temporary residence outside of Lahaina for now rather than risk exposing them to possible health problems.</p><p>Most of the guidelines for human exposure to pollutants are based on industrial settings, where people might work 40 hours a week \u2014 not their homes, where they might spend 90% of their time, said Hayes, the Boulder County air quality coordinator. Whether a home can be made safe enough for residency comes down in part to the resident's risk tolerance, Hayes said.</p><p>\u201cThere is no black-and-white, clear-cut answer,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they have young children in the home, or anyone has respiratory conditions, they might want to do significantly more cleaning than what the guidance documents are recognizing.\u201d</p>",
