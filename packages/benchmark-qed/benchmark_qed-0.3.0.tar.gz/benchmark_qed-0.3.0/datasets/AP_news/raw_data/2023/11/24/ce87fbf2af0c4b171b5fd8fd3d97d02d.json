Rudy brand whole cantaloupes and Freshness Guaranteed brand and RaceTrac brand pre-cut cantaloupes joined the list Friday.</p><p>Health officials say anyone who bought <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/sundsvall-11-23/index.html\">the recalled fruits</a> should throw them away and wash surfaces that touched them with hot, soapy water or in a dishwasher.</p><p>Most people infected with salmonella develop diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps within six hour to six days after consuming food contaminated with the bacteria. Illnesses typically last four to seven days. Vulnerable people, including children, people older than 65 and those with weakened immune systems may develop severe illnesses that require medical care or hospitalization.</p><p>___</p><p>AP Health Writer JoNel Aleccia contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
