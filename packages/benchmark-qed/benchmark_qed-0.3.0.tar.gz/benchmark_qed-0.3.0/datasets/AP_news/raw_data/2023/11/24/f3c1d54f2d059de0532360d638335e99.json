Here are the facts: DNA fragments used in the development of the coronavirus vaccine -- such as a portion of SV40\u2019s DNA sequence \u2014 are not causing health problems in people who have received the COVID-19 vaccine. Newly released footage from the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol does not show a federal agent disguised as a Trump supporter waving his badge. A video shows Israeli soldiers raising the country\u2019s flag over a United Nations-operated school in Gaza City, not Shifa Hospital. And President Joe Biden did not abruptly leave this year's turkey pardoning, a video was edited to make it appear that way.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>A roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week. None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts:</p><p>___</p><p><a href=\"No evidence that DNA sequence used in Pfizer shot leads to cancer and other health issues\">No evidence that DNA sequence used in Pfizer shot leads to cancer and other health issues</a></p><p>CLAIM: Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine contains a DNA sequence called Simian Virus 40 that can cause health problems, including cancer.</p><p>THE FACTS: No evidence has been found to suggest DNA fragments used in the development of the coronavirus vaccine -- such as a portion of SV40\u2019s DNA sequence -- are causing health problems in people who have received the COVID-19 vaccine. A recent congressional hearing r <a href=\"https://apnews.com/ap-fact-check/no-monkey-virus-dna-was-not-found-in-covid-vaccines-00000188e957d32da188e9ff1aef0000\">evived the baseless claim</a> that coronavirus vaccines contain dangerous levels of monkey virus DNA. Following the hearing, social media users began sharing a post with information from The Epoch Times website that reported Congress was warned at the hearing about \u201cDNA fragments\u201d detected in the inoculation made by Pfizer and BioNTech. The post cites testimony from Dr. Robert Malone, who played a role in developing the messenger RNA, or mRNA, technology used in the vaccine, claiming the shot includes a DNA sequence called Simian Virus 40, or SV40. \u201cThe sequence leaves behind residual DNA that could cause problems,\u201d reads one Instagram post. But the Nov. 13 hearing at the U.S. Capitol, which was held by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and other vaccine critics in the House of Representatives, repeated long-debunked falsehoods about the contents of the shot and purported health risks like cancer. Government regulatory agencies and vaccine experts told The Associated Press that the Simian Virus itself isn\u2019t present in the vaccine, and there\u2019s no evidence anything contained in the vaccine could alter a person\u2019s DNA or lead to cancer and other illnesses. The European Medicines Agency, which regulates vaccines in European Union nations, explained that \u201cnon-functional\u201d fragments of SV40\u2019s DNA sequence are used as \u201cstarting material\u201d in producing the vaccine. But they\u2019re mostly being broken down and removed in the manufacturing process. Trace amounts might remain at \u201cvery low levels\u201d in the final product, the agency and others acknowledged, but they are well within established safety guidelines.\u201c EMA has seen no evidence of an association between mRNA vaccines and adverse events that could be linked to the presence of DNA material, nor are we aware of any scientific evidence showing that the very small amounts of residual DNA that may be present in vaccine batches could integrate into the DNA of vaccinated individuals,\u201d the Amsterdam-based agency wrote in an emailed statement. The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates vaccines in the U.S., echoed the sentiment, saying no safety concerns about residual DNA in COVID vaccines have been identified, despite more than one billion shots being administered. \u201cThe FDA stands behind its findings of quality, safety, and efficacy for the mRNA vaccines,\u201d the agency wrote, deferring further questions to Pfizer and other vaccine makers. Pfizer, in an emailed statement, stressed that the use of the SV40 sequence is common practice in developing vaccines, including the influenza and hepatitis shots that have been administered globally for decades. \u201dThere is no evidence to support claims that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine contains plasmid DNA that could potentially impact a person\u2019s DNA or be a theoretical cancer risk,\u201d the company wrote, referring to DNA materials used to trigger an immune response during vaccine development. Spokespersons for The Epoch Times didn\u2019t respond to messages seeking comment.</p><p>\u2014-Associated Press writer Philip Marcelo in New York contributed this report.</p><p>___</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-capitol-attack-undercover-federal-agent-footage-636596392458\">Newly released Jan. 6 footage does not show a federal agent flashing his badge while undercover</a></p><p>CLAIM: Security camera footage from Jan. 6, 2021, shows a federal agent disguised as a supporter of then-President Donald Trump during the attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p><p>THE FACTS: The man in the video is not a federal agent. It's Kevin James Lyons, a Chicago man who <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/capitol-riot-kevin-lyons-nancy-pelosi-photograph-f9b4cb14f515bba880c4e4bc97ad0cd3\">was sentenced</a> in July to more than four years in <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/illinois-man-sentenced-felony-charge-actions-during-jan-6-capitol-breach\">federal prison</a> for his role in the attack. Multiple images of Lyons at the Capitol, dressed as he is in the footage, appear in <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.227059/gov.uscourts.dcd.227059.89.0.pdf\">court documents</a>. The false claim emerged after House Speaker Mike Johnson <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jan-6-tapes-congress-capitol-insurrection-c737a543c379413ad6e025ac603ac3e3\">on Nov. 17 began releasing</a> thousands of hours of footage from the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/capitol-siege\">Capitol insurrection</a>. Social media users \u2014 including members of Congress \u2014 seized on a clip saying it proved that undercover federal agents participated in the riot. The video, which is 5 minutes and 31 seconds long, shows rioters and law enforcement personnel moving through a hallway in the Capitol. At 21 seconds into the video, a man appears from behind a column wearing a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat, a camouflage scarf covering most of his face, and a dark blue sweatshirt layered over a green sweatshirt. He walks toward the camera, flashing his palms at the 36-second mark with a small object in his right hand. \u201cAnd that ladies and gentlemen is a badge\u2026 with a red hat and fully disguised,\u201d reads one post on X that shared a screenshot of the footage paused as Lyons is flashing his palms. But these claims play on enduring <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/arizona-ap-fact-check-ted-cruz-congress-767d5dad0631f88bb0b10a45115a1bc6\">conspiracy</a><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/television-donald-trump-washington-conspiracy-theories-congress-0ddc173391135ac2cdaa335e3c9b4881\">theories</a> about federal agents orchestrating the events of Jan. 6. Lyons <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/capitol-riot-kevin-lyons-nancy-pelosi-photograph-f9b4cb14f515bba880c4e4bc97ad0cd3\">was sentenced</a> on July 14 to 51 months in <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/illinois-man-sentenced-felony-charge-actions-during-jan-6-capitol-breach\">federal prison</a> for the part he played in the riot. <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.227059/gov.uscourts.dcd.227059.89.0.pdf\">Court documents</a> include multiple images of Lyons inside the Capitol, dressed in the same outfit as in the security footage. For example, one shows Lyons recording himself in a mirror in the office of then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In another, he sits in a car holding a framed photograph from Pelosi\u2019s office, which shows her with the late Congressman John Lewis, a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/john-lewis-us-news-ap-top-news-mitch-mcconnell-immigration-89dac7a5b1e404e49b58bef127186759\">civil rights movement icon</a> who died in July 2020. It is unclear exactly what Lyons is holding in his right hand when he flashes his palms. Lyons was convicted in April of <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/case-multi-defendant/file/1410511/download\">six charges</a>, including obstruction of an official proceeding. In addition to prison time, he was ordered to pay $2,000 in restitution to the Architect of the Capitol and complete 36 months of supervised release.

But posts online misrepresent the footage,,saying the video was taken at Gaza\u2019s largest hospital, which became <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-shifa-hospital-ce8fda9821a011a6cb6e4a3df5c90916\">a focal point</a> in the latest conflict between <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\">Israel and Hamas</a> this month. In the video, three soldiers walk along a flat rooftop carrying a flagpole bearing the Israeli flag and its distinctive Star of David, along with another purple and white flag. The group, dressed in heavy military gear, silently affixes the pole to a short column along the edge of the roof before quickly walking away. \u201cThey set up their flag on top of the Al Shifa Hospital To congratulate themselves on \u201cconquering\u201d a place filled with premature babies, injured kids and dead woman,\u201d the text on the brief clip reads. But the flag wasn\u2019t raised at Shifa Hospital \u2014 which Israel <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\">raided last week</a>, claiming it hid a command center for Hamas \u2014 but at a school elsewhere in the city. Juliette Touma, a spokesperson for the U.N.\u2019s Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, confirmed in an email Tuesday that the building shown in the video houses one of its schools in the Hamas-controlled Gaza City. Indeed, at one point in the video, the three soldiers step over the letters \u201cUN\u201d written in large dark-colored capital letters on the rooftop floor. But Touma declined to say which of the <a href=\"https://www.unrwa.org/activity/education-gaza-strip\">more than 180 schools</a> the agency operates in the Gaza Strip is shown in the video. She also said it was unclear when the flag was raised or whether or not it\u2019s still there. \u201cThis is what we have for now and we don\u2019t have more details,\u201d Touma wrote. Spokespersons for the Israeli government and military didn\u2019t respond to emails seeking comment. But the video appears to have been taken from the roof of a school building at the intersection of Tariq Ibn Ziyad and Al-Naser roads, which is located about one mile from the hospital. <a href=\"https://earth.google.com/web/@0,-0.9935,0a,22251752.77375655d,35y,0h,0t,0r\">Satellite imagery on Google</a> Earth shows the letters \u201cUN\u201d painted on the long flat roof of one building, and matches several distinctly-styled structures that are shown in the video surrounding the campus complex that includes at <a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/directions?engine=fossgis_osrm_car&route=31.52408%2C34.44328%3B31.52580%2C34.44915#map=16/31.5253/34.4470\">least four</a> schools for boys.

It\u2019s unclear who first shared the video, but Israeli journalist Hallel Bitton Rosen <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BittonRosen/status/1724739195057435035\">shared</a> a longer, clearer version of the footage on his <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.instagram.com/reel/Czqf98XtAsp/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1700679089553112&usg=AOvVaw3a8JF_fq5P9KuzlbqusyPj\">social media accounts</a> on Nov. 15.

He can be seen waving to the crowd, plus giving a thumbs up and a salute, before leaving the event. But in the edited clip he leaves abruptly after the pardoning, turning away from the crowd and breaking into a light jog for a few moments before slowing to a walk as he makes his way to the White House.
