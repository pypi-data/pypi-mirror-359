How and when their impacts are felt remains unclear. Existing abortion-related lawsuits are moving again through the courts since voters decided the issue, raising questions about implementation. The amendment voters approved Nov. 7 did not repeal any existing Ohio laws relating to abortion or reproductive rights. That has prompted some anti-abortion activists to step up pressure on Republican elected officials to extend their efforts to halt, delay or significantly water it down. It passed with a strong 57% majority of the vote.",

How and when their impacts are felt remains unclear.</p><p>Existing abortion-related lawsuits are moving again through the courts now that voters have decided the issue, raising questions about implementation.</p><p>The amendment declared an individual\u2019s right to \u201cmake and carry out one\u2019s own reproductive decisions\u201d and passed with a strong 57% majority. It was the seventh straight <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-2024-elections-republicans-ohio-virginia-90255a62d83ad9f1d86b407c9455bb0a\">victory in statewide votes</a> for supporters of abortion access nationally since <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0\">the U.S. Supreme Court overturned constitutional protections</a>.</p><p>But the amendment voters approved Nov. 7 did not repeal any existing Ohio laws, prompting some anti-abortion activists to step up pressure on Republican elected officials to extend <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-democracy-threats-republicans-ballot-initiatives-ohio-3d6e2f0d0f5993ddd75522b662d2eb34\">their efforts</a> to halt, delay or significantly water it down.</p><p>\u201cA lot of that hard work of figuring out what state laws are inconsistent with the amendment and what state laws can remain, does tend to devolve to the courts,\u201d said Laura Hermer, a professor of law at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota, who studies access to health coverage and care in the U.S. \"It\u2019s difficult to imagine that the Legislature will say, \u2018All right, you win. We\u2019re going to repeal the heartbeat ban' and so forth.\u201d</p><p>The state Legislature is controlled by Republicans whose leaders opposed the November ballot amendment, which was known as Issue 1. The Ohio Supreme Court also is controlled by Republicans, who have a 4-3 majority, and will be the final judge of constitutional questions. Several of the Republican justices have taken actions or made statements over the years that have caused abortion rights organizations and ethics attorneys to question their objectivity on the subject.</p><p>Minority Democrats in the Ohio House announced legislation two days after the election aimed at avoiding a piecemeal approach to implementing the amendment. Among other steps, they called for repealing the state\u2019s ban on most abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, which is around six weeks, and a 24-hour waiting period.</p><p>\u201cThere are over 30 different restrictions in place,\" said state Rep. Beth Liston, a physician and co-author of the Reproductive Care Act. \"And I think that it is important that we don't require citizens to go to court for every restriction, and, quite frankly, that we don't let harm occur in the interim.\u201d</p><p>House Minority Leader Allison Russo was careful not to criticize the high court, which holds sway over the fate of those laws.</p><p>\u201cMy hope is they will uphold the rule of law and the constitution,\u201d she said.</p><p>Chief Justice Sharon Kennedy last week ordered lawyers for the state and a group of abortion clinics to tell the court how they believe the measure\u2019s passage has affected <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ohio-b4c582e669c70bddafb29f5b65b19810\">a case</a> involving Ohio\u2019s ban on most abortions <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/0b1deb8c1f5d41d8ab4c9e32446a55ce\">once fetal cardiac activity is detected</a>, which <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-ohio-government-and-politics-d4dd3a0c4816ccb9f56df30163f58b9e\">has been on hold</a> since October 2022.</p><p>A day after voters approved the amendment, U.S. District Judge Michael Barrett made a similar request of the parties in a long-running <a href=\"https://apnews.com/b251cc639c98e705fbe4d5c5382adf6a\">federal lawsuit</a> challenging a set of state restrictions imposed on abortion providers\u2019 operations. They included a requirement that clinics obtain agreements with a nearby hospital for emergency patient transfers, as well as a prohibition against public hospitals entering into those agreements.</p><p>At least three other Ohio abortion laws also have been on hold in the courts.</p><p>Passing legislation to bring Ohio law in line with the new constitutional amendment has so far been a non-starter with Republican lawmakers, who mostly opposed it and took <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/constitutional-access-ohio-house-abortion-ballot-95cae24b996ce943c976dbf06d7d9867\">extraordinary steps</a> to defeat it.</p><p>With a primary election in their GOP-heavy districts only months away, they are facing fierce pressure from <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ohio-constitutional-amendment-election-misinformation-d7b3d8273389a432b011964c14959789\">anti-abortion groups</a> to go in the other direction and either pass laws countering the amendment or using their supermajorities to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ohio-abortion-overthrow-judicial-powers-77a68c1e6ee6fc79462f6aaf4ea1a323\">strip courts of their power</a> to interpret it.</p><p>\u201cThe (Ohio) Constitution specifically says reigning in out-of-control courts is the legislators' job,\" the anti-abortion group Faith2Action argues in a recently released video. \u201cSo let's call on the legislators to do their job, to use their constitutionally granted right to represent us and to keep pro-abortion judges from repealing Ohio laws based on an amendment that doesn't even mention a single Ohio law.\u201d</p><p>The video argues that the \u201cright to life\u201d created in Ohio's constitution is inalienable and that the U.S. Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade punted the abortion issue to \u201cthe people's elected representatives.\u201d</p><p>But in his <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf\">concurring opinion</a> in that ruling, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, wrote that constitutional amendments were among the avenues for deciding the future of abortion access.</p><p>\u201cMoreover, the Constitution authorizes the creation of new rights \u2014 state and federal, statutory and constitutional,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"But when it comes to creating new rights, the Constitution directs the people to the various processes of democratic self-government contemplated by the Constitution \u2014 state legislation, state constitutional amendments, federal legislation, and federal constitutional amendments.\u201d</p><p>For now, Republican Ohio House Speaker Jason Stephens has said legislation targeting the power of state courts will not be considered. GOP Senate President Matt Huffman has ruled out lawmakers pushing for an immediate repeal of Issue 1, as had once been suggested, saying nothing like that should be tried, at least in 2024.</p><p>How Attorney General Dave Yost will proceed also is being closely watched.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/SpecialPages/FINAL-ISSUE-1-ANALYSIS.aspx\">legal analysis of Issue 1</a> that the Republican published before the election, Yost said the amendment created a new standard for protecting abortion access that \u201cgoes beyond\u201d the law of the land under Roe v. Wade.</p><p>\u201cThat means that many Ohio laws would probably be invalidated ... and others might be at risk to varying degrees,\u201d he wrote.</p><p>Hermer, the law professor, said that statement is convenient for lawyers fighting to implement the constitutional amendment but such an analysis isn't legally binding for Yost.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t necessarily have to stand down, but, of course, having already said that, it\u2019s going to make it a bit more difficult to hold those sorts of positions,\u201d she said.</p>",

It covers the potential impact on existing laws, the role of the courts, and the responses from various political figures and groups. While the primary focus is on the legal and political aspects, the topic of abortion is inherently related to health, particularly reproductive health. Therefore, the document is relevant to the topic of health, though it is not exclusively focused on health-related issues."
