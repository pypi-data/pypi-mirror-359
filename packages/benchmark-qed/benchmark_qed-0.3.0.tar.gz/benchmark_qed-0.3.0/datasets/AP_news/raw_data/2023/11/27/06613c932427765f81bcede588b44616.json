    "description_summary": "A year after protests pushed Beijing to end its stringent \u201czero-COVID\u201d controls, a retired architect is on the road displaying portraits of life under the policy. But Zeng Fanzhi has a different perspective from the protesters, one shaped by the tumult of China\u2019s recent past and a lifetime of service to the Chinese state. Zeng sees China\u2019s adherence three years of \u201czero-COVID\u201d protocols as necessary and considers the paintings he created as a tribute to the heroism of ordinary people. During that time, millions of people were tested, locked in apartments, or carried off to quarantine centers as China worked to eliminate the coronavirus.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>SHENZHEN, China (AP) \u2014 In one painting, a child sits, mouth wide open, as a worker in white medical garb extends a long cotton swab toward her tonsils. In another, a masked officer and medical workers stand guard in front of an apartment cordoned off with ropes and seals reading \u201cCLOSED,\u201d as residents look on with frustration and despair.</p><p>These are some of the portraits that Zeng Fanzhi, 85, has painted to commemorate three years of China\u2019s strict \u201czero-COVID\u201d controls, which <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-health-china-fires-covid-4ffc00e5f6761be48f5887d57d66c708\">sparked nationwide protests</a> a year ago. But Zeng, a retired architect living in Shenzhen, is not a critic of the measures, under which millions of people were tested, locked in apartments, or carried off to quarantine centers.</p><p>Zeng has spent much of his life in service to the Chinese state, designing monuments in Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square and coal plants for the Ministry of Coal. He\u2019s a member of Shenzhen\u2019s state-sponsored artist\u2019s association and his paintings feature on stamps and win prizes.</p><p>The artist has a different perspective from the young protesters \u2014 one shaped by early years in China living through war and revolution, and later years witnessing decades of prosperity and growth. To Zeng, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/why-china-covid-rules-so-strict-bba6e93e5e5ef8b47fc2251a95a6b2a5\">China\u2019s adherence to \u201czero-COVID\u201d controls</a> was necessary, and its people\u2019s adherence to it heroic.</p><p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping \u201csays that artistic creation must be from \u2018The People\u2019s Standpoint,\u2019\u201d Zeng says, explaining his focus on ordinary people. \u201cThis means art should reflect the reality of people's lives. The subjects of my paintings are aligned with this direction.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Growing up, Zeng lived through some of the most tumultuous periods in Chinese history. Born to civil servants who fled for Chongqing, China\u2019s wartime capital in World War II, Zeng grew up moving from city to city, fleeing the invading Japanese and the Chinese civil war that followed.</p><p>The Communist Party\u2019s victory in 1949 ended decades of strife in China, bringing some stability to the country. Zeng aspired to be an artist and took art school entrance exams in 1957, but failed twice. His parents encouraged him to study architecture instead.</p><p>Soon after, the founder of Communist China, Mao Zedong, launched the Great Leap Forward, an ambitious but disastrous campaign to transform the impoverished country into an industrial power. Millions starved to death, and students across China spent time in political study sessions.</p><p>In 1962, fresh from college, Zeng was assigned to work for an architectural team in Beijing and put in charge of drafting designs for Tiananmen Square and the Avenue of Heavenly Peace.</p><p>A few years later, Zeng and his wife, a fellow architect, decided to move to Pingdingshan \u2014 home to one of the largest coalfields in China, nestled among mountains in the heart of the country.</p><p>There, for 20 years, they designed coal separation plants, from coal crushers to worker\u2019s dorms.</p><p>By the 1980s, the couple was getting antsy. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/a94a0d7a824b474fb11545e8c4481c21/40-years-after-death-maos-mixed-legacy-looms-over-china\">Mao had died</a> and a new reformist leader, Deng Xiaoping, was in charge. China was opening up, and opportunity beckoned on the coasts. They begged to be relocated.</p><p>\u201cWe felt like we weren\u2019t being put to our best use, so we want to jump ship,\u201d Zeng said.</p><p>College graduates like them were in scarce supply, and jobs were easy to find. They moved to Shenzhen, an experimental economic zone located next to Hong Kong in China\u2019s south. The \u201990s saw China\u2019s leaders experimenting with market capitalism, and Shenzhen was rapidly developing. Zeng began working at Shenzhen University, which back then was located in the distant suburbs and built among fields with muddy roads winding up to the entrance.</p><p>In the years that followed, Shenzhen boomed, and Zeng\u2019s family prospered. Millions came to Shenzhen to work in factories that exported goods to overseas markets. Zeng and his wife designed dozens of Shenzhen\u2019s apartments and office towers, which rose like reeds out of empty fields.</p><p>Newly affluent, they bought an apartment near the center of the city, while their children went overseas for study. Today, Shenzhen has more skyscrapers than New York or Tokyo.</p><p>\"We\u2019ve seen a lot of ups and downs in our life,\u201d says his wife, Zhao Sirong. \u201cShenzhen was a fledging city, and we were pioneers.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Zeng turned 80 that he retired from architecture. Finally, Zeng was able to pursue his true passion: painting.</p><p>Despite his old-school training, he learned his new trade in a distinctly 21st-century fashion. Day by day, he watched tutorials of master artists online.</p><p>Zeng\u2019s art is informed by socialist realism, a style he encountered growing up in Maoist China. He cites works by famed Russian realist painter Ilya Repin as inspiration, such as \u201cBarge Haulers on the Volga,\" which shows 11 men dragging a barge, exhaustion on their faces. It\u2019s an unflinching depiction of backbreaking labor, the quiet heroism of ordinary people in harsh conditions.</p><p>\u201cIt left a deep impression on me,\u201d Zeng said.</p><p>Zeng found himself drawn to similar themes. One of his paintings, \u201cLife is Not Easy,\" portrays a migrant worker bundled in scarves, selling vegetables and shivering as snow swirls around her.</p><p>Zhao, Zeng\u2019s wife, complains about his rigorous painting routine. Zeng drives to his studio every morning, painting till late afternoon. The octogenarian works weekends, leaving his wife with only her plants to keep her company.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want from my husband is that he walks slower and stops acting like a young man,\u201d Zhao said, chuckling and sighing. \u201cWhy is he working so hard? I don't understand.\"</p><p>But Zhao still supports her husband's craft because she believes regular activity is key to preventing mental decline. They wonder at young people who spend their days idle, swiping endlessly on cellphone videos and whiling away their savings on outdoor games of mahjong in steamy Shenzhen.</p><p>\u201cMy life is still very fulfilling,\u201d Zeng says. \u201cSome say painting must be tiring for you. OK, sure, but is gambling tiring for you?\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>As the coronavirus spread, Zeng was fascinated by how it upended daily life around him.</p><p>First he painted nurses swabbing residents, then children attending online classes. Then, last year, as controls grew strict and Zeng\u2019s compound was locked down, he spent his days sitting on his balcony, painting <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-china-beijing-covid-9a2189e1fe30673fe2b3c605d1444b60\">residents locked in their complexes</a>, guards standing sentry, and masked delivery drivers tossing groceries over fences.</p><p>\u201cThis was an unimaginable event that\u2019s never happened before in the whole world,\u201d Zeng says.</p><p>Zeng and his wife caught the virus last winter, when controls were abruptly lifted. Though his wife recovered quickly, Zeng spent weeks recuperating. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/zero-covid-exit-china-reopening-investigation-05e1bf6d14e3b77ade26b719093ac43b\">Across China, hundreds of thousands perished</a> as the infected overran hospitals and medication ran out of stock.</p><p>\u201cWe were all infected,\u201d Zhao said. \u201cWe struggled through the past three years, and then things suddenly opened up. We weren't psychologically prepared.\"</p><p>Despite the pandemic\u2019s historic nature, few depictions of the era exist in China outside official exhibits and state television glorifying the government\u2019s role in combatting the virus. Under Xi, the state has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/poland-china-dissident-artist-censorship-658f1c56ef1263a7a246d09c1a0a07fb\">tightened controls on artist expression</a>, leading to some going overseas.</p><p>At a Beijing art exposition this fall, one of Zeng\u2019s paintings was tucked away behind a column. The exposition, he said, deemed it too negative, as it depicted residents confined to their homes.</p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t put it on display,\u201d he said with a chuckle, walking out of his booth and gesturing to the painting.</p><p>But Zeng sees his art as commemoration, not criticism. He lived through a \u201cgreat historical event,\" he says, and he sees his artwork as an observation honoring all the sacrifice and difficulty endured by ordinary people.</p><p>For Zeng and Zhao, their government benefits \u2014 including public medical care, subsidized food, free public transit, and a pension of 10,000 yuan ($1,400) a month \u2014 is well beyond what they imagined having when they were younger, growing up in a China scarred by war.</p><p>\u201cWe understand the country\u2019s measures,\u201d Zhao says. \u201cWe all feel that on the whole, our policy was correct, because if we reopened too early, it could have been like <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/us-covid-death-toll-one-million-7cefbd8c3185fd970fd073386e442317\">the United States, where the death rate was very high</a>.\u201d</p><p>Today, Zeng is hard at work on a new series portraying Chinese leader Xi Jinping, which he hopes will serve as positive \u201cpolitical promotion\u201d. His latest depicts Xi sitting humbly among villagers. He tentatively calls it, \u201cChairman Xi Taking Us on the Road to Prosperity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy work can play a role in promoting the superiority of our distinctive socialist system,\" Zeng says. \u201cOur current era is a great era, and I want to paint paintings that capture this era.\"</p>",

While it does touch on health-related topics such as COVID-19, the zero-COVID policy, and the impact of the pandemic, the main emphasis is on Zeng's artistic career, his perspective on the measures, and his contributions to Chinese state art. Therefore, the document is only somewhat relevant to the topic of health, as it provides context on health-related events but is not centered on health itself."
