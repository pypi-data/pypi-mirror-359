The Department of Health and Social Care said Monday that it has put forward a pay offer to doctors\u2019 unions after weeks of talks. Union leaders agreed to put the proposals to their members for a vote. The results won\u2019t be known until January. Thousands of senior doctors walked off their jobs for 48-hour periods earlier this year, causing major disruptions at hospitals across England. Those strikes came on top of similar actions by junior doctors, nurses and other health workers demanding higher pay amid the U.K.\u2019s soaring inflation and cost-of-living crisis.",

The doctors' union said the government was investing 4.95% more in salaries for senior doctors, though the amount each doctor will get depends on their contracts.</p><p>Thousands of senior physicians walked off the job <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/uk-hospitals-doctors-strikes-d904a2d97474427659df293f89ab2778\">for 48-hour periods</a> earlier this year to demand better pay and working conditions from the government, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/britain-doctors-strike-pay-dbf17778e72d4698d0ab0b213eee3643\">causing major disruptions</a> at hospitals across England.</p><p>Those strikes came on top of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/british-politics-strikes-business-767b07a9e15a7e4974ea69bb1e3cd9bb\">similar industrial actions</a> by junior doctors, nurses and other health workers who organized their own strikes to obtain pay raises amid the U.K.'s soaring inflation and cost-of-living crisis.</p><p>Senior doctors said their pay has shrunk by a third in real terms over the past 14 years.</p><p>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the new offer was a \u201cfair deal\u201d for senior doctors and will be good news for patients.</p><p>This year's strike actions have put further pressure on Britain's under-funded and under-staffed <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/uk-national-health-service-nhs-anniversary-9bd203359632d8945c1cbae9031c1615\">National Health Service</a>, leading to the postponement of more than 1 million hospital appointments. The disruption also cost the NHS some 1.4 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) in lost income and staff coverage, according to health executives.</p><p>Amanda Pritchard, chief executive of NHS England, said the progress in pay negotiations was welcome news, especially because demand for hospital care always surges in winter.</p><p>\u201cThis agreement is a critical first step, and we now need all parties to continue to work together to find a solution to remaining pay disputes as soon as possible,\" she said.</p><p>Government officials earlier reached pay deals with nurses and other health workers, but they are still negotiating with doctors in the early stages of their careers over pay.</p>",
