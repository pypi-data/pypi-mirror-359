He posted on his social media site Saturday that he is \u201cseriously looking at alternatives\u201d to \u201cObamacare\u201d if he wins a second term. Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign cast the call as yet another \u201cextremist\u201d proposal from the GOP front-runner. The back-and-forth points to what could be a key issue in a general election rematch between Trump and Biden. Health care has generally been a better issue for Democrats than Republicans, who have largely abandoned efforts to repeal the law in recent years.",

And they rapidly moved to mobilize a response, including new advertising in battleground states contrasting Biden\u2019s efforts to lower drug costs with Trump\u2019s comments.</p><p>\u201cDonald Trump is campaigning on a threat to rip away health care from millions of Americans, so we\u2019re going to use every tool in our arsenal to make sure the American people know that lives are literally on the line next November,\u201d said Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler.</p><p>The back-and-forth points to what could be a key issue in a general election rematch between Trump and Biden if both win their parties' nominations, as is widely expected.</p><p>Biden's team has long operated under the assumption that Trump would be the GOP nominee, given his commanding lead in the polls, and has stepped up efforts in recent weeks to cast his proposals as extreme and to paint him as a danger to democracy. Biden, in particular, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-democracy-election-2024-president-8ff0337afec92264ae6fbaf36f55e683\">has begun painting a vision of a catastrophic future</a> if Trump wins \u2014 a strategy that could motivate lukewarm Democratic voters who may be driven more by a desire to stop Trump than to deliver a second term to Biden amid lingering concerns over <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/inflation-economy-prices-government-and-politics-89706a04bc727d3e58ab6bb4b2efa995\">high inflation</a>, the direction of the country and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-age-poll-trump-2024-620e0a5cfa0039a6448f607c17c7f23e\">his age</a>.</p><p>Health care has generally been a better issue for Democrats than Republicans, who have largely abandoned efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in recent years.</p><p>And Biden's campaign quickly seized the opportunity. Beyond the new ads, the campaign will host a press call Tuesday with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper to highlight the potential impact of repealing the law, while state Democratic parties in swing states will host their own events.</p><p>\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s America is one where millions of people lose their health insurance and seniors and families across the country face exorbitant costs just to stay healthy. Those are the stakes next November,\u201d Biden-Harris 2024 spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement.</p><p>Trump has not spent much time discussing health care as he has laid out <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-policies-agenda-election-2024-second-term-d656d8f08629a8da14a65c4075545e0f\">an aggressive agenda for a potential second term</a> that has focused on immigration crackdowns and mass deportations, as well as efforts to target political rivals.</p><p>But Trump weighed in on the issue Saturday morning on his Truth Social site.</p><p>\u201cThe cost of Obamacare is out of control, plus, it\u2019s not good Healthcare. I\u2019m seriously looking at alternatives,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe had a couple of Republican Senators who campaigned for 6 years against it, and then raised their hands not to terminate it. It was a low point for the Republican Party, but we should never give up!\u201d</p><p>He was referring to July 2017, when the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., blocked Trump\u2019s long effort to repeal the health care law, which has proven increasingly popular.</p><p>About 6 in 10 Americans say they have a favorable opinion of the health reform bill signed into law in 2010, known commonly as the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare, according to <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/interactive/kff-health-tracking-poll-the-publics-views-on-the-aca/#?response=Favorable--Unfavorable&aRange=twoYear&group=Party%2520ID::Democrat\">a KFF poll conducted in May 2023</a>.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/one-year-election-day-republicans-perceived-better-handling-economy\">recent ABC News/Ipsos poll</a> found 37% of Americans trust Democrats to do a better job than Republicans on handling health care, versus about 1 in 5 \u2014 18% \u2014 who trust Republicans over Democrats on this issue. About one-third (34%) trust neither party.</p><p>Still, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-poll-harris-survey-economy-354924a2ed1e4833668a2554f12c7f9f\">a June 2023 AP-NORC poll</a> showed a minority of U.S. adults \u2014 44% \u2014 approving of how Biden was handling health care, with 53% disapproving. That included 69% of Democrats and 17% of Republicans \u2014 measurements in line with Biden\u2019s overall job approval.</p><p>Trump's comments came in response to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/obamacare-medical-loss-ratio-elizabeth-warren-mike-braun-letter-healthcare-pbm-af77e284\">a Wall Street Journal op-ed</a> he shared highlighting <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-braun-urge-department-of-health-and-human-services-hhs-inspector-general-to-determine-if-vertically-integrated-health-care-companies-are-hiking-prescription-drug-costs-evading-federal-regulations\">concerns raised</a> by Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Mike Braun, R-Ind., that large insurance companies are using their pharmacies \u201cto evade federal requirements that limit the percentage of premium dollars spent on profits and administration, known as the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR), resulting in sky-high prescription drug costs and excessive corporate profits.\u201d</p><p>Biden's Health and Human Services Department says <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/03/23/biden-harris-administration-celebrates-affordable-care-acts-13th-anniversary-highlights-record-breaking-coverage.html\">more than 40 million are insured</a> through coverage related to provisions of the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>Moussa said Trump \u201cwould try to rip it away if he returns to power.
