The spill on Wednesday led to the closure of more than 2 miles of Southern California coastline to swimmers and surfers. The Orange County Health Care Agency\u2019s environmental division says the spill occurred following a break in a main sewer line. The closure affects much of the coastline in the upscale beach city about 50 miles southeast of Los Angeles. The health agency says the area will be closed until water quality tests meet acceptable standards. Officials have not said where exactly the break occurred.",
