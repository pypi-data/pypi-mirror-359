Christopher Luxon outlined 49 actions he said his conservative government intends to take in the next 100 days. He said Wednesday the first new law he planned to pass would narrow the central bank\u2019s mandate to focus purely on keeping inflation in check. Many of the actions he plans would repeal initiatives from the previous liberal government. His plan to repeal requirements for low nicotine levels in cigarettes, fewer retailers and a lifetime ban for youth were criticized as a setback for public health and a win for the tobacco industry.",

This aspect of the document is directly related to public health, as it involves regulations on smoking and nicotine levels, which have significant health implications. However, the document also covers other topics such as education reforms and economic policies, which are not related to health.
