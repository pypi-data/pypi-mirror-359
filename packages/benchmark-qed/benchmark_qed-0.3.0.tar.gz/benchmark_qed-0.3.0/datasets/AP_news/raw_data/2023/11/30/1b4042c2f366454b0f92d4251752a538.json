At the start of one meeting, he quipped: \u201cAs you can see, I\u2019m alive.\u201d Francis turns 87 in a few weeks. He had part of one lung removed as a young man.

On Tuesday, the Vatican announced he was cancelling his planned participation in the U.N. climate conference on doctors\u2019 orders.</p><p>\u201cThe reason is that it\u2019s very hot there, and you go from heat to air conditioning,\u201d Francis told the health care workers. \u201cThank God it wasn\u2019t pneumonia. It\u2019s a very acute, infectious bronchitis.\u201d</p><p>Previously the Vatican had said <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pope-francis-vatican-audiences-flu-600fd34afaa58bbe2447546c3a0deaeb\">Francis was suffering from a lung inflammation and the flu</a>. Francis had a previous case of acute bronchitis in the spring, when he was hospitalized for three days at Rome's Gemelli hospital so he could <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/vatican-pope-francis-illness-lung-inflammation-ef8ac8a607db7d71f995f12542ac6768\">receive intravenous antibiotics</a>.</p><p>The Vatican No. 2, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, said Thursday the Holy See was still trying to figure out how it would be represented at Dubai, where <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/cop28/\">the U.N. climate conference, or COP 28</a>, is underway. Parolin, the secretary of state, recalled that he had represented the Vatican at past U.N. climate conferences and could do the same in Dubai.</p><p>Francis was supposed to have left Rome on Friday, spoken at the conference Saturday, presided over the inauguration of a faith pavilion on the sidelines of the meeting Sunday and then returned to Rome. Parolin said doctors recommended against the trip \u201cto avoid any deterioration (in his condition) and so he can recover as soon as possible.\u201d</p>",
