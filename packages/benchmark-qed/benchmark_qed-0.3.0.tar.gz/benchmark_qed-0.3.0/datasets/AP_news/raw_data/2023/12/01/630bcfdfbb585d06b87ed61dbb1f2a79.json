Renowned opera singer David Daniels and his husband recently pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a singer who pressed the case for years. And a recent report by the BBC quoted several men saying the former CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch used a middleman to exploit them for sex. Advocates say there\u2019s an additional layer of trauma for male victims of sexual abuse, regardless of their sexual orientation.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>When Sam Schultz was sexually assaulted, it felt like a part of them died.</p><p>It took eight years and the burgeoning #MeToo movement to spur them to go public and make a police report, and an additional five years for their attackers to plead guilty.</p><p>Now, as much as Schultz hopes there\u2019s a reckoning coming in gay and queer communities, too, it feels like they are the one shouldering the blame, not the attackers. Instead of being able to focus on recovery, Schultz has been saddled with worries from other gay men that talking about sexual abuse in their community will hurt the fight for LBGTQ+ rights.</p><p>The pain of the assault and ensuing public attention and court proceedings have taken a huge toll.</p><p>\u201cIt is an exhausting and horrifying journey that I almost quit because it just takes way too much of a person,\u201d Schultz said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd to any person who has pursued justice and quit along the way, I get it. The system is not built for us. The system is built to protect certain people.\u201d</p><p>As many as 95% of male sexual violations go unreported, according to research cited in a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10135558/\">review of scientific</a> literature about male victims of sexual assault, published in April in the journal Behavioral Sciences. Four of five men who reported assaults regretted doing so, saying that police were often unsympathetic and disinterested and that the process just added more trauma.</p><p>Men may fail to report sexual assault because of stigma, shame, guilt and embarrassment; fear of not being believed; privacy concerns; and worries that their sexual orientation or masculinity will be questioned, according to research cited in the article.</p><p>Prominent male sexual abuse and assault survivors have come forward in recent years, including actor <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y_xqIz1CXc\">Anthony Edwards,</a> of \u201cER\u201d fame, who serves as the board chair and national spokesperson for the nonprofit 1in6 \u2014 so named because of research indicating that at least 1 in 6 men have experienced sexual abuse or assault.</p><p>__</p><p>This story includes discussion of sexual assault. If you or someone you know needs help, call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800-656-4673 or go to <a href=\"https://hotline.rainn.org/\">https://hotline.rainn.org</a>.</p><p>__</p><p>Schultz, now 37, described a wrenching and maddening journey from assault, when they were just 23, to adjudication and beyond.</p><p>Schultz was an aspiring opera singer and a graduate student at Houston\u2019s Rice University when they met David Daniels, a famous countertenor, and Scott Walters, a conductor, through the city\u2019s music circles. Schultz remembers admiring Daniels for being a \u201cproud gay man\u201d in a conservative art form.</p><p>The two invited Schultz to the closing of the Houston Grand Opera\u2019s \u201cXerxes,\u201d in which Daniels was starring, Schultz said. Later that night at a cast party, the couple invited Schultz to their apartment afterward, cautioning the young singer not to tell anyone, lest others get jealous.</p><p>Schultz was handed a drink and later woke up in an unfamiliar room, naked and bleeding. Shock and then fear set in.</p><p>Schultz discussed the assault with relatives, friends and a therapist but didn\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/2018/08/22/singer-claims-he-was-drugged-and-raped-in-2010-by-classical-music-power-couple/\">go public until 2018,</a> when the #MeToo movement provided more comfort in making a report.</p><p>Daniels and Walters were arrested in 2019 and maintained the encounter with Schultz was consensual until, just as the two were going to trial on charges of first-degree aggravated sexual assault, they accepted a deal to plead guilty to sexual assault of an adult, a second-degree felony. Both were sentenced to eight years\u2019 probation and required to register as sex offenders.</p><p>The men still tell others in the opera community that they aren\u2019t guilty, Schultz said, and that the plea was just to avoid prison. Schultz saw others in the opera community rally around the attackers, and was criticized for besmirching the reputation of prominent gay men.</p><p>Ted Gideonse, an associate professor of teaching of health, society and behavior at the University of California, Irvine, public health program, noted that for gay and bisexual men, lines of consent have been historically muddy. That doesn\u2019t make it right. The longtime illicit nature of sexual encounters between men meant that by necessity they had to be coded.</p><p>Schultz sees some signs of things changing for men who report abuse.</p><p>Just last month, the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-66889779\">BBC published a report</a> after a two-year investigation that uncovered stories alleging that Mike Jeffries, the former CEO of clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch, used a middleman to exploit young adult men for sex at events he hosted at his home in New York and at hotels in Paris, London and elsewhere.</p><p>A dozen men described events involving sex acts that were run for Jeffries and his partner, Matthew Smith, from 2009 to 2015. Jeffries stepped down from Abercrombie & Fitch in 2014.</p><p>After Schultz first told their own story, a man in his 60s heard it on the radio and realized he had been sexually assaulted in college, too.</p><p>\u201cHe wrote to me that he broke down crying at the breakfast table and for the first time started to understand what had happened to him when he was in college,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cAnd I think a lot of men push experiences away so they don\u2019t ever have to deal with them.\u201d</p>",
