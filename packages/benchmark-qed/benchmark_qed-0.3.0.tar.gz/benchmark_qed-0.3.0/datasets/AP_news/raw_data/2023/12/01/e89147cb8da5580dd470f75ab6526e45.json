The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that COVID-19 remains the main cause of hospitalizations and deaths in the country. The agency said a surge in RSV infections may be about to peak. And CDC officials say they are also looking into reports of outbreaks of pneumonia in two states, but say they don\u2019t believe it\u2019s due to anything unusual. As the flu season progresses, 11 states are now reporting a high level of illnesses.",

In a new CDC report on Friday, the agency said the tally was up to 11 states \u2014 mostly in the South and Southwest.</p><p>In the last month, RSV infections rose sharply in some parts of the country, nearly filling hospital emergency departments in Georgia, Texas and some other states. But \"we think we\u2019re near the peak of RSV season or will be in the next week or so,\" Cohen said.</p><p>RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus is a common cause of mild coldlike symptoms but it can be dangerous for infants and older people.</p><p>Cohen was asked about pneumonia cases in children reported in Massachusetts and in Warren County, Ohio, near Cincinnati. There are a number of possible causes of the lung infection, and it can be a complication of COVID-19, flu, or RSV.</p><p>In Ohio, health officials have reported 145 cases since August and most of the children recovered at home. The illnesses were caused by a variety of common viruses and bacteria, officials said.</p><p>Massachusetts health officials said there\u2019s been a modest increase in pneumonia in kids but that it is appropriate for the season.</p><p>China recently had a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/china-respiratory-illnesses-who-ff6da613bf15d6848f12095b8e0d8fd1\">surge in respiratory illnesses</a> which health officials there attributed to the flu and other customary causes.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
