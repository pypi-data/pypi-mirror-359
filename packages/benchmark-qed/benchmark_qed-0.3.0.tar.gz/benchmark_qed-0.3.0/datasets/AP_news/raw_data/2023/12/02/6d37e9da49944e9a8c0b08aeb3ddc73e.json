    "description_summary": "The United States has taken action to reduce methane emissions from oil and natural gas production. The Environmental Protection Agency says a new Biden administration rule announced Saturday will sharply reduce methane and other harmful air pollutants that contribute to global warming. The agency also says the rule will promote use of cutting-edge methane detection technologies and deliver significant public health benefits such as fewer asthma attacks and hospital visits. U.S. officials announced the rule at the U.N. climate conference being held in the United Arab Emirates. Air pollution from oil and gas operations can cause cancer, harm the nervous and respiratory systems and contribute to birth defects.",

Air pollution from oil and gas operations can cause cancer, harm the nervous and respiratory systems and contribute to birth defects.</p><p>EPA Administrator Michael Regan and White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi announced the final rule at the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cop28-united-nations-climate-change-dubai-aljaber-543225dd77913eee8ca69bc53ea3da76\">U.N. climate conference</a> in the United Arab Emirates. Separately, the president of the climate summit announced Saturday that 50 oil companies representing nearly half of global production have pledged to reach <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-changemethanecop28-58c756d843fbc696b28a330295505be7\">near-zero methane emissions</a> and end routine flaring in their operations by 2030.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-dubai-cop28-climate-change-faa8031d0e41b3b9458eecebf03e564b\">Vice President Kamala Harris</a>, the top American representative at the summit, said the U.S. and other nations must act boldly to confront the fallout from climate change.</p><p>\u201cThe urgency of this moment is clear,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe clock is no longer just ticking. It is banging. And we must make up for lost time.\u201d</p><p>The U.S. rule on methane emissions is part of a broader effort by the Biden administration that includes financial incentives to buy electric vehicles and upgrade infrastructure \u2014 spending that Harris said will total roughly $1 trillion over 10 years.</p><p>Oil and gas operations are the largest industrial source of methane, the main component in natural gas and far more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term. It is responsible for about one-third of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Sharp cuts in methane emissions are a global priority to slow the rate of climate change and are a major topic at the conference, known as COP28.</p><p>Presidents, prime ministers and royals from nations rich and poor have vowed to reduce how much their countries spew heat-trapping gases and asked their colleagues to do better.</p><p>\u201cOn Day One, President Biden restored America\u2019s critical role as the global leader in confronting climate change,'' Regan said, referring to Biden's actions <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-executive-orders-b5b409da08e42414b9a12e2c67ee2df6\">returning the U.S. to the Paris climate agreement</a> and ordering an immediate review of environmental regulations rolled back by the previous administration.</p><p>The methane rule finalizes a proposal Biden <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-joe-biden-business-scotland-europe-aa0893a5aaa68f4ec3a431dc2712a587\">made at a UN climate conference in Scotland in 2021</a> and expanded <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-business-prices-oil-and-gas-industry-climate-environment-3a5b7049478ec7161fcbd18f1ebdb0ba\">a year later at a climate conference in Egypt</a>. It targets emissions from existing oil and gas wells nationwide, rather than focusing only on new wells, as previous EPA regulations have done. It also regulates smaller wells that will be required to find and plug methane leaks. Such wells currently are subject to an initial inspection but are rarely checked again for leaks.</p><p>Studies have found that smaller wells produce just 6% of the nation\u2019s oil and gas but account for up to half the methane emissions from well sites.</p><p>The plan also will phase in a requirement for energy companies to eliminate routine flaring, or burning of natural gas that is produced by new oil wells.</p><p>The new methane rule will help ensure that the United States meets a goal set by more than 100 nations to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030 from 2020 levels, Regan said.</p><p>The EPA rule is just one of more than 100 actions the Biden administration has taken to reduce methane emissions, Zaidi added.</p><p>\u201cFrom mobilizing billions in investment to plug orphaned wells, patch leaky pipes and reclaim abandoned mines, to setting strong standards that will cut pollution from the oil and gas sector, the Biden-Harris Administration is putting the full throw-weight of the federal government into slashing harmful methane pollution,'' he said.</p><p>The new rule will be coordinated with <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/inflation-biden-health-seniors-medicare-9c2b70dc2f2d7291acc4292799ff342c\">a methane fee</a> approved in the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/technology-science-congress-climate-and-environment-f084d23d61ebb068068d4aa92c82fdbb\">2022 climate law.</a> The fee, set to take effect next year, will charge energy producers that exceed a certain level of methane emissions as much as $1,500 per metric ton of methane. The plan marks the first time the U.S. government has directly imposed a fee, or tax, on greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>The law allows exemptions for companies that comply with the EPA\u2019s standards or fall below a certain emissions threshold. It also includes $1.5 billon in grants and other spending to help companies and local communities improve monitoring and data collection, and find and repair natural gas leaks.</p><p>Harold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association, called the new rule a victory for public health.</p><p>\u201cEPA heeded the urgent guidance of health experts across the country and finalized a strong methane rule that, when fully implemented, will significantly reduce hazardous air pollutants and climate-warming methane pollution from the oil and gas industry,'' he said in a statement.</p><p>Methane has been shown to leak into the atmosphere during every stage of oil and gas production, Wimmer said, and people who live near oil and gas wells are especially vulnerable to these exposure risks.</p><p>David Doniger, a climate expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, called methane a \u201csuper-polluter.\u201d He said in an interview that the Biden plan \"takes a very solid whack at climate pollution. I wish this had happened 10 years ago (under the Obama administration), but I'm really happy it's happening now.''</p><p>Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, said the new rule ensures that \u201cthe U.S. now has the most protective methane pollution limits on the books. With other countries also zeroing in on methane as a key climate risk, it\u2019s a signal to operators worldwide that clean-up time is here,'' he said.</p><p>The American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry's top lobbying group, said it was reviewing the rule to see whether it meets a dual goal of reducing emissions while meeting rising energy demand.</p><p>\"Smart federal regulation can help build on industry\u2019s progress to date,'' said Dustin Meyer, an API vice president.</p><p>The oil industry has generally welcomed direct federal regulation on methane, preferring a national standard to a hodgepodge of state rules. Even so, energy companies have asked EPA to exempt hundreds of thousands of the nation\u2019s smallest wells from the pending rule.</p><p>__</p><p>Associated Press writer Will Weissert in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.</p>",
