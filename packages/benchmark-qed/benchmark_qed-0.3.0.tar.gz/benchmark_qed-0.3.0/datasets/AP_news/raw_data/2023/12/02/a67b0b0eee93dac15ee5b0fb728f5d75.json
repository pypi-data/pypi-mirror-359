A jury on Friday convicted of Stacey Vaillancourt of manslaughter and child cruelty in the 2019 death of Harper Rose Briar. The 6-month-old was found unresponsive while in Vaillancourt\u2019s care, and an autopsy determined she had high concentrations of diphenhydramine, an ingredient in over-the-counter antihistamines including Benadryl. Vaillancourt\u2019s defense attorney said there was no evidence to prove Vaillancourt sedated the infant, but the prosecutor told jurors that no one else could have done it.",
