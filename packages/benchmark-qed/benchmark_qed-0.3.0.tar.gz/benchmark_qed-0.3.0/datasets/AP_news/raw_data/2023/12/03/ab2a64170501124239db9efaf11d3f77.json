Under a brown haze over Dubai, participants at the COP28 summit moved beyond lofty rhetoric and calls for unity to curb global warming to concerns like the deaths of at least 7 million people globally from air pollution each year and the spread of diseases like cholera and malaria as global warming upends weather systems. In the background and off-stage \u2014 participants were also turning attention to tough negotiations over the next nine days to push for more agreement on ways to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times.",

Conference of Parties on climate to hold its first \u201cHealth Day\u201d in its 28th edition, saying the threats to health from climate change were \u201cimmediate and present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlthough the climate crisis is a health crisis, it\u2019s well overdue that 27 COPs have been and gone without a serious discussion of health,\u201d he said. \u201cUndoubtedly, health stands as the most compelling reason for taking climate action.\u201d</p><p>After two days of speeches by dozens of presidents, prime ministers, royals and other top leaders \u2014 in the background and on-stage \u2014 participants were also turning attention to tough negotiations over the next nine days to push for more agreement on ways to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times.</p><p>Pope Francis, who was forced to abandon plans to attend because of a case of bronchitis, on Sunday said that \u201ceven from a distance, I am following with great attention the work.\u201d In remarks read at the Vatican by an aide, the pope called for an end of what he called \u201cbottlenecks\u201d caused by nationalism and \u201cpatterns of the past.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cop28-un-climate-talks-uae-restrictions-speech-activists-critics-5bf679a5b4736ff758ec6ec99b98f0b5\">Protests began in earnest</a> Sunday at COP28: In one, a group gave mock resuscitation to an inflatable Earth.</p><p>\u201cWell, I mean, it\u2019s cheesy doing CPR on the Earth,\u201d said Dr. Joe Vipond, an emergency room physician from Alberta, Canada, who took part. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of in a lot of trouble right now,\" he said, so will do \"anything we can do to bring attention to this issue.\u201d</p><p>Saturday capped off with conference organizers <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-changemethanecop28-58c756d843fbc696b28a330295505be7\">announcing that 50 oil and gas companies had agreed to reach near-zero methane emissions</a> and end routine flaring in their operations by 2030. They also pledged to reach \u201cnet zero\u201d for their operational emissions by 2050.</p><p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said \u201cthe promises made clearly fall short of what is required.\u201d</p><p>In comments Sunday, he called the methane emissions reductions \u201ca step in the right direction.\u201d But he criticized the net zero pledge for excluding emissions from fossil fuel consumption \u2014 where the vast majority of the industry's greenhouse gases come from \u2014 and said the announcement provided no clarity on how the companies planned to reach their goals.</p><p>\"There must be no room for greenwashing,\" he said.</p><p>Germany\u2019s climate envoy Jennifer Morgan said Sunday the oil and gas industry needs to go beyond just cutting emissions that are generated to make those products and slash emissions from indirect activities too, as well as fossil fuels burned by the end users.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s 2023,\u201d the former Greenpeace International co-director said. \u201cI was already speaking to Shell about this in 1998.\u201d</p><p>Temperature rises caused by the burning of oil, gas and coal have worsened natural disasters like floods, heat waves and drought, and caused many people to migrate to more temperate zones \u2014 in addition to the negative knock-on effects for human health.</p><p>\u201cOur bodies are ecosystems, and the world is an ecosystem,\u201d said John Kerry, the U.S. climate envoy. \u201cIf you poison our land and you poison our water and you poison our air, you poison our bodies.\u201d</p><p>He said his daughter Vanessa, who works with the WHO chief, \u201crepeats to me frequently that we should not measure progress on the climate crisis just by the degrees averted, but by the lives saved.\u201d</p><p>A COP28 declaration backed by some 120 countries stressed the link between health and climate change. It made no mention of phasing out planet-warming fossil fuels, but pledged to support efforts to curb health care sector pollution, which accounts for 5% of global emissions, according to the WHO head.</p><p>In the United States, 8.5% of greenhouse gas emissions come from the health sector and the Biden Administration is trying to use funds from the Inflation Reduction Act to try to cut that down, Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services Admiral Rachel Levine said.</p><p>U.S. officials said one of the main issues has been waste anesthesia emissions from hospitals and greenhouse gases that escape when patients are treated for respiratory diseases like asthma with albuterol inhalers.</p><p>Part of the solution may come through raising awareness: when officials used a system that showed anesthesiologists how much gas they used and how much escaped, emissions fell by as much as half, said Dr. John Balbus, the Health and Human Services climate change and health equity director.</p><p>Dr. Yseult Gibert of Montreal said 70 percent of operating-room emissions come from the way patients are given anesthesia. She said some types of anesthesia are more climate-friendly than others, without sacrificing on quality or effectiveness when it comes to care.</p><p>A <a href=\"n the fight against HIV, Tuberculosis, Malaria, for women and children\u2019s health and when dealing with global emergencies in LMICs.\">report last week issued</a> by Unitaid, which helps get new healthcare products to low- and middle-income countries, explored how product redesign, improvements in manufacturing and other measures could reduce the carbon footprint of 10 products used for health emergencies, women's and children's health, and HIV, malaria and tuberculosis.</p><p>Forest fires caused in part by climate change can have dramatic effects on homes, health and lives. Heat waves, which can be deadly, also can weigh on mental health, Gibert said, while poor air quality can make life harder for those facing lung and heart ailments and cause respiratory issues, like asthma in kids.</p><p>\u201cNot a lot of people know that the climate crisis is a health crisis,\u201d she said.</p><p>The impact of human activity on the climate was visible to conference-goers in Dubai, an oil-rich boom city that often faces higher levels of air pollution than other places on Earth due to its location. Haze is common.</p><p>The Dubai government, on its <a href=\"https://dubaiairenvironment.dm.gov.ae/air_quality\">web site</a>, listed its Air Quality Index level mostly at \u201cgood\u201d on Sunday.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.iqair.com/ae/world-air-quality-ranking\">IQAir</a>, a Swiss vendor of air-quality monitoring products, listed Dubai as the city with the 18th-worst air quality in the world with \u201cmoderate\u201d air quality levels as of noon local time on Sunday. It cited high levels of two types of particulate matter in the air and advised mask-wearing for \u201csensitive groups\u201d and a reduction of outdoor exercise.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell, Seth Borenstein and Peter Prengaman in Dubai and Frances D'Emilio in Rome contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.
