    "description_summary": "There is no piped water or sewage system in Athi River, near Kenya's capital Nairobi, and drought is making clean water supplies more scarce and expensive for locals. But for those whose homes are kitted out with water filters distributed by local groups, the nearby river \u2014 polluted, prone to drought and usually unsafe for drinking \u2014 is becoming a cheaper and more reliable source of clean water. Bucket Ministry, a nonprofit organization, provided over 600 water filters to households in the four neighborhoods in Athi River since August and plans to up that number to 6,000. Advocates say stop-gap solutions like filters make a difference, but underlying issues like climate change-fueled drought and poor water management need to be addressed.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>BONDENI-JUA KALI, Kenya (AP) \u2014 As the sun rises in the Bondeni-Jua Kali neighborhood on the outskirts of Kenya\u2019s capital Nairobi, dozens of women and men step out of their corrugated iron homes with yellow jerricans, skip over pools of sewage and make their way to a nearby water vending station.</p><p>There is no piped water or sewage system in the area, and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/politics-somalia-climate-and-environment-droughts-938278de19defb24971e9221121d8034\">drought</a> has made clean water supplies more scarce and expensive for locals. Twice a week, trucks with 5,000 to 10,000 liters (1,300 to 2,600 gallons) of water will fill up vending stations across Athi River where residents can buy 20 liters (five gallons) for 20 Kenyan Shillings ($0.16). A household of four needs about five gallons a day, and weekly incomes are about $13, according to data from Kenya\u2019s Finance Ministry.</p><p>But for those whose homes are kitted out with water filters distributed by a local nonprofit, the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kenya-athi-river-at-risk-eb5956f6cfbe72331b9dae38d5d390ca\">nearby river \u2014 polluted, prone to drought and usually unsafe for drinking</a> \u2014 is becoming a cheaper and sometimes more reliable source of clean water. And while advocates say underlying issues like <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment\">climate change</a> -fueled drought and poor water management need to be urgently addressed, solutions like filters make a short-term difference because deliveries are often not enough for the neighborhoods\u2019 needs.</p><p>Many rely on unsafe alternatives if they miss out on the trucked-in stocks.</p><p>\u201cSometimes, we get to the water vending stations and find that the queue is long and then the water finishes and you have to wait,\u201d said 46-year-old resident Joyce Ngui. \u201cMost of the times you don\u2019t have money to buy even the salty water sold around. So we have no choice but to use the swamp water,\" she said.</p><p>When The Associated Press met Ngui, she was heading to a swamp to draw water to clean her family\u2019s clothes and for cooking. Part of the slimy swamp is clogged with overgrown water lilies. Ngui doesn\u2019t have a water filter, so she can\u2019t turn the swamp water into something suitable for drinking.</p><p>Ngui would like a filter, \u201cso that we can be able to filtrate the dirty water and be able to drink it,\u201d she said. Otherwise, \u201cit just has germs and diseases.\u201d</p><p>Bucket Ministry, a Christian nonprofit organization, has been providing communities around Nairobi and other parts of Kenya with the easy-to-use water filters. It provided over 600 filters, made by the water filtering company Sawyer, to households in the four neighborhoods in Athi River since August and plans to up that number to 6,000.</p><p>The devices are the size of a small water bottle and are fitted with a hose pipe onto a bucket. They can filter water from the river and nearby swamps into potable water that can be used by residents.</p><p>\u201cIt filters every germ or pathogen that causes water-borne diseases,\" said Derrick Mesulamu, the country director for the group. \u201cIt is designed in such a way that it has micro holes that don\u2019t allow those particles that cause water-borne diseases to pass through.\u201d</p><p>Josephine Mutile, a resident with a water filter, is already seeing the benefits.</p><p>\u201cI have been sick often and visiting the hospital where I am tested and told that I have typhoid, or an amoeba infection or diarrhea. Boiling water (to kill viruses and bacteria) is expensive because cooking gas is expensive,\u201d Mutile said. \u201cNow I have this filter, it will help me a lot.\u201d</p><p>Data from the Machakos County health ministry, of which Athi River is part, says that four out of 10 cases at public health clinics in the area are related to water-borne disease. At least 10 people died following a cholera outbreak in Mavoko area in the region between October last year and March.</p><p>Machakos' local government has been desilting and cleaning up the river, but most of the pollution, including plastic bags and bottles, happens upstream, where residents in poorer areas of Nairobi dump waste into the Nairobi River that then flows into the Athi River.</p><p>\u201cBecause of water scarcity, residents in Machakos have turned to rivers, shallow wells or other sources which are contaminated with pollutants \u2014 including human and animal waste,\u201d said Machakos County Governor Wavinya Ndeti.</p><p>She told The AP that the county government is cracking down on industries that have been disposing chemical waste and other pollutants into the Athi River.</p><p>Authorities \u201chave put in place regulations to monitor and limit industrial pollution, but the effectiveness all depends on compliance and strict enforcement, which we will do,\" she said.</p><p>Historically, Athi River is a water-scarce region, grasslands turned brown from the scorching sun and huge tracts of land were left untilled as residents couldn't farm the drylands.
