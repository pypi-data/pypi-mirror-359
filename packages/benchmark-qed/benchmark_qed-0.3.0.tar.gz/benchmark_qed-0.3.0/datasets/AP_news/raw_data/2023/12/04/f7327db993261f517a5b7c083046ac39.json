The legislation aims to protect the health of youths and mitigate the environmental impacts of the increasingly popular disposable products known as \u201cpuffs.\u201d The National Assembly is expected to vote on the measure Monday night. If passed, it would move to the Senate, and could go into effect by September 2024. The initiative aligns with a global trend, with the UK, Ireland, and Germany considering similar measures. New Zealand and Australia already have implemented restrictions.",

If passed, it would then move to the Senate and could go into effect by September 2024.</p><p>Disposable e-cigarettes are small, battery-powered devices that deliver vaporized nicotine with various flavorings. While they do not contain tobacco, many include nicotine, a dangerous chemical known for its addictive properties.</p><p>Marion Catellin, president of the Alliance Against Tobacco, told The Associated Press that \u201csingle-use e-cigarettes are made of plastic. They contain a lithium battery and other heavy metals including cobalt and bromine. And these pods contain nicotine which is a highly toxic product \u2026 On the basis of its environmental impact alone, these single-use e-cigarettes puffs warrant a ban.\u201d</p><p>Disposable e-cigarettes differ from reusable <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/vaping\">vaping devices</a> in that they are not designed to be refilled or recharged. Their small, non-rechargeable lithium batteries often end up in landfills.</p><p>Their rising popularity among teenagers, due to their tangy or fruity tastes and colorful designs, is causing alarm among lawmakers.</p><p>This bill is part of a broader trend. The UK, Ireland, and Germany are considering similar measures. New Zealand and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/australia-tobacco-vaping-56f48b72d13893b9ec7efd9baf7f0017\">Australia</a> have already implemented restrictions. New Zealand\u2019s measures include mandating lower nicotine levels and restrictions on vape shop locations near schools.</p><p>The surge in disposable e-cigarettes in the U.S. market, primarily from China, following the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s 2020 ban on flavored reusable e-cigarettes like Juul, exemplifies the broader challenge. The flavor restrictions didn\u2019t apply to disposable products, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fda-vapes-vaping-elf-bar-juul-80b2680a874d89b8d651c5e909e39e8f\">which proliferated in the wake of the regulation</a>.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press journalist Alex Turnbull in Paris contributed.</p>",
