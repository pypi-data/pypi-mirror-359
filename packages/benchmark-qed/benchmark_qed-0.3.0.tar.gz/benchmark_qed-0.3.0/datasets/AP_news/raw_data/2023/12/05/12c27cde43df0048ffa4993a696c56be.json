The Wisconsin State Journal reports that the county already stopped requiring the repayments from 2020 forward. It's now looking to stop pursuing cases before that date. The county budget passed in November calls for asking the state to stop pursuing older births. That could expunge 3,000 cases. Advocates for the switch say demanding repayment from unwed fathers increases parental stress and can lead to birth problems.",
