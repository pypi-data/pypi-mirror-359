The agency lodged charges against Frontier in 2018, after several <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/8e8db16cb80c4d8a80a7461d3f9151c8\">pilots sued the airline</a>.</p><p>Aditi Fruitwala, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups that filed the lawsuit, said the settlement should send a message to airlines and other employers about making reasonable accommodations to pregnant and breastfeeding employees.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful this will inspire more change and stronger protections for workers across the airline industry,\u201d Fruitwala said.</p><p>Frontier's vice president for labor relations, Jacalyn Peter, said the airline is \u201cat the forefront of accommodating the needs of pregnant and breastfeeding mothers in the airline industry.\u201d She said advances in wearable lactation technology made it possible to reach a settlement that maintains safety.</p><p>Last year, Frontier settled a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-health-denver-lawsuits-airlines-c7c7d16449935f687b0d23e2097e3a9d\">similar lawsuit by flight attendants</a>. The employees said Frontier forced them to take unpaid leave for pregnancy-related absences and didn't let them pump breast milk while working.</p><p>Frontier did not admit liability in settling the lawsuits. In the case involving Denver-based pilots, the airline also agreed to comply with a current union agreement letting pregnant pilots fly if they have medical approval.</p><p>The airline also agreed to continue to let breastfeeding pilots reduce their schedules to 50 hours of flying per month, and to update and make available a list of lactation facilities at airports.</p>",
