The health care giant said Tuesday that it will roll out a new reimbursement model designed to make costs more predictable. The company will start offering it next year to some third-party cash discount card administrators. Cash discount cards like those offered by GoodRx can give customers a break on out-of-pocket costs for some prescriptions, depending on the person\u2019s coverage and the drug. CVS Health drugstores will use its new model more broadly in 2025.",
