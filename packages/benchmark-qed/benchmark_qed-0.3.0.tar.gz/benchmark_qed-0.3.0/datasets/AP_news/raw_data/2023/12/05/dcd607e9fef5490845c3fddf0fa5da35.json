U.S. Attorney Carlton S. Shier says the Americans with Disabilities Act protects people in recovery from the disorder. Shier said Monday that the settlement requires the jail to ensure that any FDA-approved medication is available. The agreement follows an investigation by the Justice Department that stemmed from a complaint alleging the jail refused to provide an inmate with a lawfully prescribed medication. The agreement says Big Sandy denies allegations of discrimination but agrees to the terms of the settlement.",

The complaint alleged that the jail refused to provide an inmate with lawfully prescribed buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder.</p><p>Big Sandy denied allegations of discrimination, but agreed to cooperate with the federal government and fully comply with requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the agreement said. The jail in Paintsville serves Johnson, Lawrence, Magoffin, and Martin counties.</p><p>The agreement requires Big Sandy to revise its policies to medically evaluate all individuals for the disorder and to provide access to all three forms of FDA-approved medications. It also requires the jail to ensure that inmates already taking medication will continue on it and those that need it to have access even if they weren't being treated before being incarcerated, the settlement said.</p>",
