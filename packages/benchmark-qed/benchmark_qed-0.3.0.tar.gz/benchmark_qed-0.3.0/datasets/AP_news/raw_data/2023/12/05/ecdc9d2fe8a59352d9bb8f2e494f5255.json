That\u2019s similar to the rate for Hispanic and Alaska Native patients \u2013 and nearly double the rate for white patients. The poll released Tuesday by KFF, a health policy research group, found people of color brace against discrimination in health care far more often than white people. Experts say the survey points to deeper problems that can influence critical interactions between a doctor and patient.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>A trip to the doctor\u2019s office comes with a bit of preparation for most, maybe even an internal pep talk to prepare for being told to get more exercise or calm a simmering fear of needles.</p><p>But dressing well in hopes of warding off unfair treatment \u2013 or even bracing for being insulted?</p><p>A <a href=\"https://files.kff.org/attachment/Topline-KFF-Survey-on-Racism-Discrimination-and-Health.pdf\">newly released poll by KFF</a>, a health policy research group, found many patients of color \u2014 including 3 in 5 Black respondents \u2014 take such steps at least some of the time when seeing a doctor.</p><p>The poll found that 55% of Black respondents said they feel like they must be very careful about their appearance to be treated fairly at medical visits. That\u2019s similar to the rate for Hispanic and Alaska Native patients \u2013 and nearly double the rate for white patients.</p><p>Nearly 30% of Black respondents prepare to be insulted, also about double the rate for white patients.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s exhausting,\u201d survey respondent Christine Wright, 60, told The Associated Press.</p><p>Wright, who is Black, says she\u2019s faced years of discrimination \u2013 including once being called a racial slur by a nurse. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017 and recently found a doctor she trusts. But she still makes sure to dress well for any medical appointments, putting on jewelry, a nice coat and making sure her hair is done.</p><p>She braces herself for looks and comments from doctors and staff. \u201cThey don\u2019t control you,\" she tells herself. \"They don\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t matter what they\u2019re saying about you. Because you\u2019re not that.\u201d</p><p>While more than 90% of those polled said they were not treated unfairly or with disrespect in a health care setting because of their race or ethnic background in the past three years, the anticipation of unequal treatment can influence patients\u2019 interactions with their doctors, experts say. That\u2019s a particular concern because of the <a href=\"https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/from-birth-to-death/index.html\">wide disparities in health outcomes along racial lines</a> in the U.S.</p><p>\u201cThis survey shows the impact racism and discrimination continues to have on people\u2019s health care experiences,\u201d said KFF President Drew Altman.</p><p>Dr. Allison Bryant, an obstetrician at Massachusetts General Hospital who was not involved in the survey, said it provided important \u2013 though not necessarily surprising \u2013 results.</p><p>Bryant, who also serves as her hospital system's associate chief health equity officer, said she has heard similar stories from patients of color and seen it in the system's own patient satisfaction data. And as a Black woman, she lives the experience herself, often double-checking she has her ID or wedding ring visible to ward off assumptions from others.</p><p>\u201cI think everybody experiences that to some extent,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cBut I understand why it\u2019s more exaggerated in individuals of color, who have a legacy of not being treated well.\u201d</p><p>The behavior indicates a deeper problem, Bryant said, one that can influence critical interactions between a doctor and patient.</p><p>If you anticipate someone may treat you badly you may be more tense, you may not speak properly, she said. \u201cThere are deep harms that are associated with this that go beyond what it might look like at the surface, which is like, \u2018I put on some high heels and I put on some lipstick.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Jeymie Luna Rold\u00e1n, 45, also participated in the survey. She thinks her previous lack of health insurance or her imperfect English contributed to her bad experiences at the doctor. She spoke to the AP in Spanish.</p><p>\u201cIn my case, I\u2019m Latina,\u201d said Rold\u00e1n, of Lake Worth, Florida. \u201cSo when I have an appointment, I have to dress up a little \u2013 put on earrings, makeup \u2013 so that they don\u2019t see me in my work clothes. There\u2019s a saying that goes, \u2018Como te miro, te trato.\u2019\u201d</p><p>That translates to: \u201cYou\u2019re treated how you look.\u201d</p><p>Despite high percentages of people saying they prepare for insults or feel their appearance can influence how they are treated at the doctor, 93% said they have not felt they were treated unfairly or with disrespect in a health care setting because of their race or ethnic background in the past three years.</p><p>But there were still wide differences among racial groups. Asians and Hispanics were three times more likely to say they\u2019ve been treated badly in a health care setting because of their race than white respondents and Black respondents were 6 times more likely.</p><p>Beyond the doctor\u2019s office, 58% of American Indians and Alaska Natives, 54% of Black respondents, 50% of Hispanics, and 42% of Asians said they experienced at least one type of discrimination in daily life at least a few times in the past year. That includes getting poorer service at stores and restaurants, being threatened, harassed, or treated like they are not smart, or being criticized for speaking a language other than English.</p><p>While this shows health care is just one of the settings where discrimination is persistent, Bryant said, being treated with disrespect at a car dealership or profiled at a department store poses a different type of risk. A dismissive cardiologist not ordering the right tests because a patient doesn\u2019t \u201clook the part\u201d is potentially more dangerous.</p><p>\u201cThe consequences in health care are really striking and very frightening, honestly, to understand what people need to do to be taken seriously, to be seen as a whole person,\u201d she said. \u201cI think these data really speak to that.\u201d</p><p>__</p><p>AP video journalist Mary Conlon contributed to this report.</p><p>__</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
