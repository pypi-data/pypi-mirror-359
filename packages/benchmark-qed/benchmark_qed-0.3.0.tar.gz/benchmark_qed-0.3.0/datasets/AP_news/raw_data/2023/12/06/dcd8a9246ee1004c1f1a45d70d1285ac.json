A lawsuit originally filed in September 2022 by a group of Indiana residents and the group Hoosier Jews for Choice makes the case that the ban violates a 2015 religious freedom law approved by Republican lawmakers. After a county judge ruled in favor of the residents last year, Indiana's attorney general appealed the decision. The court heard arguments Wednesday but did not indicate when it would rule on the appeal.",

The court heard arguments Wednesday at the Indiana Statehouse, but did not indicate when it would rule on the appeal.</p><p>The lawsuit argues the ban violates Jewish teachings that \u201ca fetus attains the status of a living person only at birth\u201d and that \u201cJewish law stresses the necessity of protecting the life and physical and mental health of the mother prior to birth as the fetus is not yet deemed to be a person.\u201d It also cites theological teachings allowing abortion in at least some circumstances by Islamic, Episcopal, Unitarian Universalist and Pagan faiths.</p><p>Solicitor General James Barta argued in court that the ban does not violate the law because \u201cthe unborn are persons entitled to protections.\" Three judges hearing arguments peppered him with questions about current exemptions to the abortion ban, including in limited cases of rape and incest.</p><p>\u201cAren't religious beliefs just as important as those concerns?\u201d Judge Leanna K. Weissmann asked.</p><p>The judges also questioned ACLU of Indiana\u2019s legal director Ken Falk about the state Supreme Court's decision earlier this year <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/indiana-abortion-ban-dc149c0716e3cf5be604bb5f427db7b8\">to uphold the ban</a>. Falk said at least some of the residents have changed their sexual practices because of the ban despite of their religion's teaching on abortion.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Indiana Attorney General\u2019s office said in a written statement it looks forward to the court\u2019s ruling. \u201cWe once again stood up for the rights of the most vulnerable today,\u201d the statement said.</p><p>The suit is one of many across the country wherein religious freedom is cited as a reason to overturn a state's abortion ban, including one <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-lawsuit-religious-leaders-missouri-c0332a5d0d0a5671afcd7e6640a15f7d\">in Missouri</a> and one in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-2022-midterm-elections-health-kentucky-legislature-26ecd225013231ee8766248633d289a3\">Kentucky</a>.</p><p>In the Missouri case, 13 Christian, Jewish and Unitarian leaders are seeking a permanent injunction barring the state\u2019s abortion ban. The lawyers for the plaintiffs said at a court hearing state lawmakers intended to \u201cimpose their religious beliefs on everyone\u201d in the state.</p><p>The lawsuit will likely to go to the state Supreme Court. Indiana\u2019s near total abortion ban went into effect in August after the Indiana Supreme Court upheld it in the face of a separate legal challenge from the ACLU.</p><p>The ACLU of Indiana revamped its efforts impede the ban in November. In a separate and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-indiana-providers-broaden-access-00801f91be3b314c21673c8de8d8aa85\">amended complaint</a>, abortion providers are seeking a preliminary injunction on the ban in order to expand its medical exemptions and block the requirement that abortions be performed at a hospital.</p><p>Indiana <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-us-supreme-court-health-indianapolis-indiana-83fe300188fcf15d8a3b4a36ceee7443\">became the first state</a> to enact tighter abortion restrictions after the U.S. Supreme Court ended federal abortion protections by <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0\">overturning Roe v. Wade</a> in June 2022. The near total ban makes exceptions for abortions at hospitals in cases of rape or incest and to protect the life and physical health of the mother or if a fetus is diagnosed with a lethal anomaly.</p>",

Instead, it centers on legal arguments, religious beliefs, and court proceedings. Therefore, the document is somewhat relevant to the topic of health but not highly focused on it."
