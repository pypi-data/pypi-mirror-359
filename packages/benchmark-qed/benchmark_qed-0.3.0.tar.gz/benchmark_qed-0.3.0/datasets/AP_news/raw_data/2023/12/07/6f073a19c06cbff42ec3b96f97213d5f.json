December 2, 2023.</p><p>Editorial: More mental health resources, collaboration are vital</p><p>The job of police officers in enforcing laws and keeping the peace is daunting enough without the added burden of being mental health professionals.</p><p>Yet that is far too often a role police have to play.</p><p>That point was driven home Wednesday during a town hall hosted by The Kentucky Judicial Commission at Sloan Convention Center. It was the final of nine sessions across the state.</p><p>Commission members have traveled Kentucky for town halls to gather input on how to improve how the state\u2019s justice system addresses people with challenges involving mental illness, substance use and intellectual or developmental disabilities.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve learned much from the citizens of Kentucky about what our needs are and what our strengths are,\u201d said Kentucky Supreme Court Deputy Chief Justice Debra Hembree Lambert, who chairs the mental health commission. \u201cThis has been a very powerful journey.\u201d</p><p>One of the many important issues discussed was the scenario where police, called to a scene, often encounter individuals suffering a mental health crisis that is not necessarily a crime.</p><p>Melanie Watts, director of community engagement for LifeSkills and a former Bowling Green Police Department officer, said that city police have crisis intervention training that helps officers de-escalate such a situation.</p><p>\u201cPolice do not need to be involved with the mentally ill at all times,\u201d Watts said. \u201cThe police have been put in a situation they did not ask to be put in ... .\u201d</p><p>The solutions to that problem, and the many others discussed Wednesday, are not simple, but it\u2019s clear more resources and more collaboration between those in our judicial system and mental health providers are good first steps.</p><p>We applaud The Kentucky Judicial Commission for putting a spotlight on these issues, and encourage our legislators to support and fund appropriate initiatives to address these often neglected issues.</p><p>___</p><p>Ashland Daily Independent. December 2, 2023.</p><p>Editorial: Proud of student\u2019s courage</p><p>The accident could have been worse, but in the heat of the moment, nobody knew. That\u2019s why a young man who jumped in to help deserves recognition, and he got that recognition at the Boyd County School Board meeting this week.</p><p>The school system\u2019s transportation manager, Amy Conley, wrote a letter, which was read at the meeting, commending Boyd County High School sophomore and Navy JROTC Cadet Joshua Summers for helping during a bus accident on Nov. 10.</p><p>First, Summers checked on the driver, and then assisted the driver in recording student names, seat numbers and dates of birth, all the while helping keep his fellow students remain calm and organized and offering assistance any way he could.</p><p>Summers made the staff and faculty in Boyd County proud, showing courage and leadership.</p><p>Summers is a shining example of those traits. The community should be proud, too. His acts inspire continued faith in the upcoming generations.</p><p>END</p>",

The first editorial discusses the need for more mental health resources and collaboration between the judicial system and mental health providers in Kentucky. This directly addresses issues related to mental health, which is a significant aspect of the broader topic of health. The second editorial, however, is about a student's courageous actions during a bus accident and does not relate to health. Given that half of the document is highly relevant to health, the overall relevance is moderate."
