Health officials in both countries also reported dozens of new illnesses on Thursday. In the U.S., at least 230 people are sick and 96 have been hospitalized since mid-November. Many of those who fell ill reported eating pre-cut cantaloupe sold in clamshell packages and trays. Salmonella can cause serious illness in young children, people older than 65 and those with conditions that weaken their immune systems.",
