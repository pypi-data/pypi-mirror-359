    "description_summary": "The family of a Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputy who killed himself has filed a $20 million wrongful-death claim against the county, blaming years of working in jails and mandatory overtime for his depression. The claim was filed Thursday on behalf of the family of Deputy Arturo Atilano-Valdez, who shot himself at home on Nov. 7, leaving behind his wife and two daughters. The claim says Atilano-Valdez spent the last 12 years assigned to jails despite requests to be transferred. A similar claim was filed last month in the case of a deputy who was killed by a gunman in September. That claim contends overtime left him too fatigued to stay alert to threats. Sheriff Robert Luna told reporters this week that the department is working on plans to reduce overtime and hire more deputies.",

A claim is a required step before a lawsuit.</p><p>Atilano-Valdez started his career in 2001 and spent the last 12 years assigned to jails despite requests to be transferred, the claim said. He saw doctors and therapists but the overtime and \u201cvirtual imprisonment\u201d became too severe, it said.</p><p>A similar $20 million claim was filed last month in the case of Deputy Ryan Clinkunbroomer, who was fatally shot by a gunman while driving a patrol car on Sept. 16. His parents claim that required overtime left him too fatigued to stay alert to such threats.</p><p>Sheriff Robert Luna, who took office last December, addressed overtime and other strains on deputies during a press conference this week, saying it was unacceptable that there have been eight employee suicides in the past year.</p><p>As of Nov. 5, the department was short 1,200 sworn deputies and 1,600 professional staff members, he said.</p><p>\u201cWe are working on a multiphase plan to reduce mandatory overtime ... we have some units that are working mandates between eight and 12 a month,\" he said. \"That concerns me greatly from an employee wellness perspective.\u201d</p><p>The number of psychiatric doctors hired by the department has been boosted to more than 20, he said.</p><p>\u201cWe tell people there's no shame in raising your hand and saying, \u2018I need help, I need to talk to somebody\u2019 because our employees see things on a daily basis that people shouldn't see,\u201d the sheriff said.</p><p>He said he believes a lot of wellness issues involve untreated post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>",
