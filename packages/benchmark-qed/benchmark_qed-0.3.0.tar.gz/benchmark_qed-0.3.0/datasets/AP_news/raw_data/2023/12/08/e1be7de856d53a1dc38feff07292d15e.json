Originally, the proposal expanded eligibility for compensation under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, offering compensation to residents of New Mexico, Colorado, Montana, Guam and Missouri \u2014 as well as those in some parts of Arizona, Nevada and Utah \u2014 who suffered the effects of nuclear testing or uranium mines and aren\u2019t covered under the current program. The Santa Fe New Mexican reported that the House removed those provisions Wednesday.",
