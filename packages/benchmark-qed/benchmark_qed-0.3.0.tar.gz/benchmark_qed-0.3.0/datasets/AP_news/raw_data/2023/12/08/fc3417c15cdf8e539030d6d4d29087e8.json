The pope has been steadily recovering, and for the Dec. 8 holiday devoted to Mary kept a traditional appointment to pray at the Spanish Steps on Friday. He arrived in a black car, and blessed a crowd of onlookers before taking a seat in a chair facing a statue of the Madonna. Before his appointment at the Spanish Steps, Francis went to the St. Mary Major basilica to pray before one of his favorite icons to Mary. He entered the basilica in a wheelchair.",
