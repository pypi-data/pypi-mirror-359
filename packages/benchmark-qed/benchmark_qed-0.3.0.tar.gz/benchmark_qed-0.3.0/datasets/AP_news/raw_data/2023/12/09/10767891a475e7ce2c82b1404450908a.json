The order Friday throws into limbo an unprecedented challenge to one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S. The order by the all-Republican court came more than 30 hours after Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two from the Dallas area, received a temporary restraining order from a lower court judge. Cox is represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, whose attorneys say they will not share her abortion plans, citing concerns for her safety. In a filing with the Texas Supreme Court on Friday afternoon, her attorneys indicated she was still pregnant.",

In a filing with the Texas Supreme Court on Friday, her attorneys indicated she was still pregnant.</p><p>Cox was 20 weeks pregnant this week when she filed what is believed to be the first lawsuit of its kind since the landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-dobbs-anniversary-state-laws-51c2a83899f133556e715342abfcface\">that overturned Roe v. Wade.</a> The order issued Thursday only applied to Cox and no other pregnant Texas women.</p><p>Cox learned she was pregnant for a third time in August and was told weeks later that her baby was at a high risk for a condition known as trisomy 18, which has a very high likelihood of miscarriage or stillbirth and low survival rates, according to her lawsuit.</p><p>Furthermore, doctors have told Cox that if the baby\u2019s heartbeat were to stop, inducing labor would carry a risk of a uterine rupture because of her two prior cesareans sections, and that another C-section at full term would would endanger her ability to carry another child.</p><p>Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton argued that Cox does not meet the criteria for a medical exception to the state's abortion ban, and he urged the state's highest court to act swiftly.</p><p>\u201cFuture criminal and civil proceedings cannot restore the life that is lost if Plaintiffs or their agents proceed to perform and procure an abortion in violation of Texas law,\u201d Paxton's office told the court.</p><p>He also warned three hospitals in Houston that they could face legal consequences if they allowed Cox's physician to provide the abortion, despite the ruling from state District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble, who Paxton called an \u201cactivist\u201d judge.</p><p>On Friday, a pregnant Kentucky woman <a href=\"ndmark U.S. Supreme Court decision last year that a woman has asked a court to approve an abortion.\">also filed a lawsuit</a> demanding the right to an abortion. The plaintiff, identified as Jane Doe, is about eight weeks pregnant and she wants to have an abortion in Kentucky but cannot legally do so because of the state\u2019s ban, the suit said.</p><p>Unlike Cox's lawsuit, the Kentucky challenge seeks class-action status to include other Kentuckians who are or will become pregnant and want to have an abortion.</p>",

It details the legal proceedings, the medical risks involved, and the implications of the state's restrictive abortion laws. While the primary focus is on the legal aspects, the document also touches on significant health-related issues such as the medical condition of the fetus, the health risks to the mother, and the broader implications for reproductive health rights. Therefore, it is relevant to the topic of Health, particularly in the context of reproductive health and legal restrictions on medical procedures."
