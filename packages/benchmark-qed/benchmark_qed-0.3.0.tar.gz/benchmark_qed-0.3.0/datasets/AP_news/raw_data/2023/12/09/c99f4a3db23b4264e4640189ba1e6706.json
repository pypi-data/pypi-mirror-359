Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center officials say a Nov. 19 hack hit a portion of the health care system\u2019s clinical network, possibly leaking patient data. The Seattle Times reports that this week some former and current patients received threatening emails claiming the names, Social Security numbers, medical history and other data of more than 800,000 patients had been compromised. Emails shared with the newspaper claim the stolen data of recipients will be sold. After last month\u2019s hack, the center took its clinical network offline, notified federal law enforcement and brought in a forensic security firm to investigate.",
