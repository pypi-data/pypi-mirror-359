The office of the chief medical examiner on Monday said it wants to know if a brain injury stemming from 40-year-old Robert Card\u2019s military service could have contributed to unusual behavior he exhibited before the shootings on Oct. 25 in Lewiston, Maine. The concern surrounds Card's exposure to blasts while training U.S. Military Academy cadets in guns, anti-tank weapon and grenades at West Point, New York.",

It is our belief that if we can conduct testing (in-house or outsourced) that may shed light on some of those answers, we have a responsibility to do that,\u201d Lindsey Chasteen, office administrator, wrote in an email.</p><p>The gunman's body was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/maine-shooting-lewiston-fed5ab0aaee9d7d4c0f0fccb3d301bb7\">found two days after the shootings</a> in a nearby town. The medical examiner already concluded that Card died by suicide.</p><p>The tissue samples, first reported by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/11/us/brain-blast-army-robert-card-maine-lewiston.html\">The New York Times</a>, were sent to a laboratory at Boston University that specializes in problems associated with brain trauma, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, which has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nfl-football-super-bowl-football-sports-joe-namath-f24de31db5c743f29d1a5c280aa72037\">plagued many professional football players</a>. A spokesperson said the CTE Center cannot comment without the family\u2019s permission. Two family members didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.</p><p>The concerns surround Card's exposure to repeated blasts while training U.S. Military Academy cadets about guns, anti-tank weapon and grenades at West Point, New York.</p><p>Card was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 304th Regiment, in Saco, Maine, starting in April 2014 and during that time he trained others on how to use hand grenades, the Army said.</p><p>A Pentagon spokesperson said Monday that the Army is participating in studies to try to better understand the relationship between \u201cblast overpressure\u201d and brain health effects, and in the meantime it has instituted several measures to reduce soldiers\u2019 exposure, including limiting the number of personnel near blasts.</p><p>\u201cThe Army is committed to understanding, mitigating, accurately diagnosing and promptly treating blast overpressure and its effects in all forms. While prolonged blast exposures can be potentially hazardous, even if encountered on the training range and not the battlefield, there is still a lot to learn,\u201d Lt. Col. Rob Lodewick said in a statement.</p><p>Family members and friends reported that Card had become paranoid behavior that preceded him being hospitalized for two weeks last summer during training with fellow reservists at West Point. Among other things, Card thought others were accusing him of being a pedophile.</p><p>His fellow soldiers were concerned enough that his access to weapons was restricted when he left the hospital. At least one of the reservists specifically expressed concerns of a mass shooting.</p><p>New York and Maine both have laws that can lead to removal of weapons for someone who's experiencing a mental health crisis, but those laws were not invoked to take his guns.</p><p>Law enforcement officials in Maine were warned about concerns from Card's fellow reservists. But Card didn't answer the door at his Bowdoin home when deputies attempted to check on his well-being several weeks before the shootings.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow David Sharp on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/david_sharp_ap?lang=en\">@David_Sharp_AP</a></p>",
