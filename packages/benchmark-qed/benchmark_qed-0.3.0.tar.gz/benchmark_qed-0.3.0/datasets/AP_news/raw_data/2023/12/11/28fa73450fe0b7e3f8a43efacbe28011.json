The lawmakers want to expand a federal commercial fishing occupational safety program that funds research and training. The program is designed to help the nation\u2019s fishermen with the often hazardous conditions they face at sea. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said expanding the program would help fishermen access more safety training and mental health resources. Collins and the lawmakers introduced the proposal late last week.",

Edward Markey of Massachusetts, who added the expansion would \"provide much needed funding to ensure that fishermen are getting the information and resources they need to stay safe and healthy on the job.\u201d</p><p>Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska is another supporter of the change. Alaska produces the most volume of seafood in the country, while New England is home to New Bedford, Massachusetts, the top U.S. port in terms of seafood value.</p><p>The lawmakers' proposed changes would increase the program's annual funding from $6 million to $12 million, a Collins spokesperson said. The proposal would also remove a cost share component from the program, the spokesperson said.</p><p>Commercial fishing is one of the most dangerous occupations in the country, and access to more mental and behavioral health supports is critically important for the nation's fishermen, said Andrea Tomlinson, founder and executive director of New England Young Fishermen\u2019s Alliance.</p><p>\u201cProviding our next generation of fishermen and women with the mental health and substance abuse care that they need is vital to the success of our industry,\u201d Tomlinson said.</p>",
