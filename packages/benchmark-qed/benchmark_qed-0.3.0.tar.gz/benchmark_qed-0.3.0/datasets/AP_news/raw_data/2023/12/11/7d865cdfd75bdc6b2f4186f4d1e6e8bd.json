    "description_summary": "Attorneys for a pregnant Texas woman who sought court permission for an abortion in an unprecedented challenge to one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S. say she has left the state to obtain the procedure. The announcement came Monday as 31-year-old Kate Cox awaited a ruling from the Texas Supreme Court over whether she could legally obtain an abortion under narrow exceptions to the state\u2019s bans. A judge gave Cox permission last week but that decision was put on hold by the state\u2019s all-Republican high court. The court ruled against Cox later Monday. Cox's lawsuit quickly became a high-profile test of bans in Texas and a dozen other GOP-controlled states, where abortion is prohibited at nearly all stages of pregnancy.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 A pregnant Texas woman whose fetus has a fatal condition left the state to get an abortion elsewhere before the state Supreme Court on Monday rejected her unprecedented challenge of one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S.</p><p>Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two, had spent nearly a week seeking court permission in Texas to end her pregnancy, but her attorneys said she could not wait any longer and left the state. Her baby has a condition known as trisomy 18, which has low survival rates, and her lawsuit argued that continuing the pregnancy jeopardized both her health and ability to have more children.</p><p>Texas\u2019 abortion ban makes narrow exceptions when the life of the mother is in danger but not for fetal anomalies. Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton argued that Cox had not shown that any of the complications in her pregnancy rose to the level of threatening her life.</p><p>\u201cHer health is on the line. She\u2019s been in and out of the emergency room and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-care-wait-times-us-roe-dobbs-7b0a328bb34b0acb3d37e359a63712fc\">she couldn\u2019t wait any longer,\u201d</a> said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which was representing Cox.</p><p>The organization did not disclose where Cox went. On Monday, she would have been 20 weeks and six days pregnant.</p><p>Hours after Cox's attorneys announced she had left Texas, the state Supreme Court issued its decision that ruled against Cox. It came three days after the court <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/texas-abortion-ban-supreme-court-decision-10767891a475e7ce2c82b1404450908a#:~:text=AUSTIN%2C%20Texas%20(AP)%20%E2%80%94,restrictive%20bans%20in%20the%20U.S.\">temporarily halted</a> a lower judge's ruling that gave Cox permission to get an abortion.</p><p>\"No one disputes that Ms. Cox\u2019s pregnancy has been extremely complicated. Any parents would be devastated to learn of their unborn child\u2019s trisomy 18 diagnosis,\" the court wrote. \u201cSome difficulties in pregnancy, however, even serious ones, do not pose the heightened risks to the mother the exception encompasses.\u201d</p><p>Cox, who lives in the Dallas area, was believed to be the first woman in the U.S. to ask a court for permission for an abortion since <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-dobbs-anniversary-state-laws-51c2a83899f133556e715342abfcface\">Roe v. Wade was overturned last year.</a> Her lawsuit quickly became a high-profile test of bans in Texas and a dozen other GOP-controlled states, where abortion is prohibited at nearly all stages of pregnancy.</p><p>Days after Cox filed her lawsuit, a pregnant woman in Kentucky also <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-kentucky-aclu-lawsuit-14df6d5e8a5aaa36009557d080b1c779\">asked a court to allow an abortion.</a> There has been no ruling yet in that case.</p><p>In Texas, Paxton mounted an aggressive defense to try to prevent Cox from having an abortion. He sent three Houston hospitals letters warning of legal consequences \u2014 both criminal and civil \u2014 if they allowed Cox's physician to provide the procedure. He also argued that Cox had not demonstrated that her life was at imminent risk, including noting that she was sent home after her multiple visits to emergency rooms.</p><p>Cox had cesarean surgeries during her first two pregnancies. Her lawsuit argued that inducing labor would carry a risk of a uterine rupture because of her prior C-sections, and that another one at full term would would endanger her ability to carry another child. But Paxton contended those arguments still fell short.</p><p>\u201cRather, the only question is whether Ms. Cox\u2019s condition meets the exception, regardless of how long the child is expected to live,\u201d Paxton's office told the court in a filing over the weekend.</p><p>Dr. Leilah Zahedi-Spung, a maternal fetal medicine specialist in Colorado and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, said when lethal fetal anomalies are diagnosed \u201cthere\u2019s only risk to that pregnant person and no benefit unfortunately for that innocent child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are putting your body through risks without any benefit because prolonging the pregnancy doesn\u2019t change the survival rate,\u201d Zahedi-Spung said.</p><p>Doctors told Cox that her fetus has a condition known as trisomy 18, which is when a baby has an extra copy of chromosome 18. The diagnosis has a very high likelihood of miscarriage or stillbirth, and low survival rate. Doctors told Cox that inducing labor or carrying the baby to term could jeopardize her ability to have another child.</p><p>Trisomy 18 occurs in approximately 1 in 2,500 diagnosed pregnancies, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. There is no live birth in about 70% of pregnancies involving the diagnosis that proceed past 12 weeks gestational age, according to a legal filing that the two groups submitted to the court.</p><p>The termination of pregnancies because of fetal anomalies or other often-fatal medical problems <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ending-pregnancies-over-grave-medical-problems-e504e595f5f4ea6139db3f7b5155ca85\">is seldom discussed</a> in national debates over abortion. There are no recent statistics on the frequency of terminations for fetal anomalies in the U.S. but experts say it\u2019s a small percentage of total procedures.</p><p>Texas has long been at the forefront of strict abortion laws in the U.S., and even now, there are ongoing efforts to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-travel-ban-roads-west-texas-3997304c4156f131ee90bb1363735ba3\">make it harder for pregnant women to leave Texas</a> for states where the procedure is legal. This year, a federal judge in Texas ruled that the bans do not apply to helping women get abortions out of state.</p><p>Under Texas\u2019 bans, doctors who provide an abortion can face criminal charges that carry punishments of up to life in prison. They could also face lawsuits from private citizens, who are empowered to sue a person who helps a woman obtain an abortion, such as the doctor\u2019s staff.

While the primary focus is on the legal and political aspects of abortion laws, it also touches on health-related issues such as the risks to the woman's health, the medical condition of the fetus (trisomy 18), and the implications for future pregnancies. These health aspects are relevant to the topic of health, but the document is not primarily focused on health in a broader sense."
