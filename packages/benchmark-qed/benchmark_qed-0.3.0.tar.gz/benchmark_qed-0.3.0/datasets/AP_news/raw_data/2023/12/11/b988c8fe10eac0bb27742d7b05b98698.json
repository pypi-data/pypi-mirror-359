    "body_nitf": "<p>Des Moines Register. December 10, 2023.</p><p>Editorial: Iowa Republicans have made a mess of family planning. Will they fix it?</p><p>Anti-abortion legislators and Gov. Kim Reynolds have enacted a parade of policies in Iowa that focus mainly on punishing abortion providers.</p><p>Ensuring the availability of reproductive health care \u2014 from providers better aligned with this anti-abortion vision \u2014 has seemed to be a secondary goal.</p><p>Iowa is seeing the results of these priorities. <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/2017/01/11/editorial-who-can-replace-planned-parenthood/96442742/\">As predicted</a>, ever since Statehouse Republicans cut off Planned Parenthood from government money in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/reproductive-health-impact-study\">fewer people have received</a> subsidized counsel and care. More surprising is that the state can\u2019t manage to get its purported \u201cpro-life\u201d alternatives off the ground.</p><p>The state could go in three directions from here.</p><p>\u2014 Leaders could do nothing and leave Iowans in need of services flailing.</p><p>\u2014 They could acknowledge the statistics and try to understand why Iowans are not visiting anti-abortion reproductive care providers.</p><p>\u2014 Or they could allow experts including Planned Parenthood to resume their proven work helping Iowa families.</p><p>That last, and best, direction isn\u2019t likely, given that Republican leadership has invested a lot of time and energy into trying to deceive people into thinking that abortion is all Planned Parenthood does. But pretending that there\u2019s no major problem should not be palatable either.</p><p>Iowa family planning history: How we got here</p><p>Two major actions have led us to where we are today:</p><ul><p>1. Six years ago, the Republican-controlled Legislature removed Iowa from the federal family planning network and set up a state version that would not allow funding to reach clinics that provide abortions.</p><p>2. Over the past two years, the Legislature has tried to put money toward a program called \u201cMore Options for Maternal Support,\u201d or MOMS, intended to assist <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2023/02/13/why-iowa-wants-to-fund-crisis-pregnancy-centers-to-deter-abortions/69866144007/\">crisis pregnancy centers</a> that are not medical clinics and steer girls and women away from considering abortion. Abortion rights advocates correctly pillory crisis pregnancy centers for misleading women about abortion, but <a href=\"https://www.thegazette.com/guest-columnists/moms-program-connects-pregnant-women-with-support-services/\">MOMS raised the prospect</a> at least of some material assistance \u2013 donated baby items, for instance \u2013 reaching girls and women in need.</p></ul><p>The results: Reproductive care that doesn\u2019t measure up</p><p>How have those actions worked out?</p><ul><p>3. The state family planning network is an underused disaster. The number of people obtaining services through it dropped 83% from 2017 to 2021, <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2023/11/21/iowa-blocked-abortion-providers-clinic-from-state-funded-program-impacted-iowans/71571314007/\">the Register\u2019s Michaela Ramm reported</a>. That\u2019s hundreds fewer people every year getting help with birth control, pelvic exams and other services. <a href=\"https://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/usa/ab-usa-IA.html\">The number of abortions</a> in the state \u2014 presumably the statistic that matters most to Republicans \u2014 has increased. <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2023/08/22/syphilis-cases-in-iowa-climb-but-other-sexually-transmitted-infections-decline/70602338007/\">Data on sexually transmitted diseases</a> is a bit of a mixed bag, but syphilis cases have risen substantially.</p><p>4. <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2023/11/08/iowa-fails-again-to-find-administrator-for-moms-network-of-crisis-pregnancy-centers-abortion/71406812007/\">Iowa can\u2019t even get MOMS off the ground</a>. Two rounds of bidding for a nonprofit agency to administer it have failed. State officials deserve some faint praise on this point: They appropriately rejected a bidder this year because it wasn\u2019t able to meet the state\u2019s standard for data collection. Documenting how MOMS money is used is, indeed, a rock-bottom expectation, particularly in light of widely reported fraud and other misspending associated with a similar program in Texas that had relatively few guardrails. The state will continue trying to run a MOMS network itself, for now.</p></ul><p>Iowa Republicans make it harder for girls and women to find help</p><p>All this has happened against the backdrop of anti-abortion decisions from the Trump administration and then from the U.S. Supreme Court. <a href=\"https://iowaappeals.com/uncategorized/iowa-supreme-courts-splintered-abortion-ruling-four-opinions-covering-182-pages/\">The Iowa Supreme Court also flip-flopped</a> and removed abortion protections. The Legislature then passed a law banning almost all abortions; it\u2019s on hold while it\u2019s reviewed in court. Meanwhile, the state Board of Medicine, which is required to prepare rules to enforce the law should it take effect, <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2023/11/17/iowas-top-medical-officials-consider-new-rules-for-6-week-abortion-ban-reynolds-fetal-heartbeat/71594367007/\">is considering language</a> that uses political, not medical, terminology, and would require doctors to assess, perhaps in an adversarial manner, whether a pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.</p><p>The collective effect of all these Republican policies has been to make help harder to find, period.</p><p>What Iowa Republicans are offering \u2014 a family planning network that ostensibly offers reproductive health care except for abortions and a network of pregnancy resource centers that excludes proven health care procedures \u2014 is vastly inferior to what was available here before 2017 and to what remains available in much of the country. Elsewhere, leaders recognize and celebrate Planned Parenthood\u2019s expertise in averting unplanned pregnancies and providing competent, nurturing care.</p><p>The Iowa systems aren\u2019t delivering as advertised, not even close. Neither network is providing even these reduced services in a meaningful way. Nor is the state spending any money to help Iowans learn about the family planning services that remain available.</p><p>What Iowa really needs to do to foster the best outcomes for women and for children is to reverse course and take advantage of all family planning providers. Given that unlikelihood, the state at the very least must puts more effort into actually connecting its family planning network and MOMS with Iowa families who need help.</p><p>___</p><p>Daily Nonpareil. December 9, 2023.</p><p>Editorial: Condemnation worth a pause before sharing</p><p>While careful, precise, intentional language is always laudable, it\u2019s an absolute necessity when discussing certain issues.</p><p>Use the wrong word, or phrase, and you\u2019re likely to shut down a conversation before any actual communication can take place.</p><p>As college Democrats at the University of Iowa learned, it can also get you accused of advocating for genocide.</p><p>In a world where the leading candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidency jokes about being a dictator \u2014 if only for one day \u2014 to own the libs, perhaps hearing that a group of youthful Democrats supports genocide doesn\u2019t ring the alarm bells that it should.</p><p>But such extreme rhetoric should ring an alarm bell when you hear it. You should say, \u201cIs that right?\u201d In the case of Mr. Trump, sadly it is. For the UI Democrats, though, it isn\u2019t \u2014 at least, that\u2019s certainly not what they intended to convey.</p><p>A pro-Palestine statement issued Nov. 1 from the college group concluded with the line, \u201cMay every Palestinian live long and free, from the river to the sea.\u201d</p><p>That phrase is considered antisemitic by the Anti-Defamation League among others. It has historic pro-Palestinian roots, but it has been adopted by anti-Israel entities, including Hamas.</p><p>It refers to the area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, which includes Gaza, Israel and the West Bank.</p><p>U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who was censured in part of using the phrase, described the slogan as \u201can aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate.\u201d</p><p>The college Democrats changed their statement to read, \u201cMay every Palestinian live long and free.\u201d Nonetheless, the Iowa Democratic Party issued a statement condemning them and calling on the leaders who signed it to resign.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s be very clear. That is a call for Jewish genocide and we wholly condemn that offensive language,\u201d Iowa Democratic Party state chairwoman Rita Hart said in response to the college students.</p><p>Matthew Charles, a UI senior and treasurer of University Democrats, told The Gazette that Hart didn\u2019t communicate with the students beforehand.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re saying, unambiguously, these people are calling for Jewish genocide, which obviously is not true,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything, we made a mistake and used a few words that we shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>Last weekend, Hart said it was \u201cnot an easy situation to handle\u201d and \u201ca very tough political situation.\u201d</p><p>It needn\u2019t have been, though. A short delay in reacting \u2014 allowing time to reach out and gather facts, and likely diagnose the problem as overzealousness on the part of college students \u2014 would have avoided much of the consternation.</p><p>Talking to someone before publicly condemning them doesn\u2019t seem like too much to ask, even if it means you\u2019re not the first to be seen reacting. That\u2019s especially true when dealing with topics where language use can be particularly tricky.</p><p>We hope the lesson learned by both sides of this tiff is to take a moment, take a breath and be sure of what you\u2019re saying.</p><p>END</p>",

This directly relates to health. The second editorial, however, focuses on the use of language in political discourse and does not pertain to health.
