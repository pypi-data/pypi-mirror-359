Thirty-year-old Dominic Torro of Bow, New Hampshire, was coming down \u201cAirplane Gully\u201d in a wilderness area with a friend Saturday morning at the time. A New Hampshire Fish and Game conservation officer says Torro\u2019s friend and another skier went to Torro and called 911. No one else was caught in the avalanche. Torro was taken by helicopter to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon. A message seeking his condition was left with a spokesperson. The Mount Washington Avalanche Center said it is currently in a general advisory period, not yet in a daily hazard rating.",

While it does touch on health-related aspects such as the injury, medical guidance, and the skier's condition, the main focus is on the event and the rescue operation rather than health itself. Therefore, it is somewhat relevant to the topic of health but not highly focused on it."
