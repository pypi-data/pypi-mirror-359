Officials from the Food and Agriculture Organization presented the findings in Senegal\u2019s capital, Dakar. The report is compiled by the U.N. and aid groups. It says nearly 50 million people could face food insecurity and more than 2.5 million will be on the brink of starvation. Climate change and inflation are contributing factors but the main driver of food insecurity is increasing violence, particularly across the Central Sahel \u2014 the vast expanse below the Sahara Desert \u2014 which has been hardest hit.",

While the primary focus is on food insecurity and hunger, these issues are closely related to health, as malnutrition and lack of access to food can lead to severe health problems. The document also mentions the inability to meet the soaring needs due to dwindling funds, which can further exacerbate health issues.
