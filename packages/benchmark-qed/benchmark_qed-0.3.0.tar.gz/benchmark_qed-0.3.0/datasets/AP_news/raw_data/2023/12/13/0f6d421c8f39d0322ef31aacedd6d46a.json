    "description_summary": "Repeated recalls of eyedrops are drawing new attention to the limited powers U.S. regulators have to oversee medical products made overseas. Unlike prescription drugs, eyedrops and other over-the-counter products don't get preliminary review by the Food and Drug Administration. In the case of two eyedrop recalls earlier this year, FDA inspectors had never previously visited the plants in India. In both cases, when FDA inspectors arrived on site they found dangerous conditions. The FDA is asking Congress for new powers, including the ability to require drugmakers to immediately recall products. But experts say those authorities will do little without more resources for foreign inspections.",

Inspections increased this year but are still far below pre-pandemic levels.</p><p>FDA spokesman Jeremy Kahn said: \u201cThe FDA works to inspect as many facilities possible, but ultimately industry is responsible for the quality of their products.\"</p><p>An October recall of two dozen eyedrop brands came after FDA staff found cracked floors, barefoot workers and other unsanitary conditions at a Mumbai plant that supplied products to CVS, Walmart and other major retailers. It was the first time FDA staff had visited the site.</p><p>That inspection was prompted by an <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/new-york-city-business-health-4572be6da44f4fab4e0f691f5e37e3ed\">earlier recall</a> of tainted eyedrops from a different Indian plant that's been linked to four <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/eyedrops-recall-ezicare-delsam-outbreak-2a0f0cc1273cc71b122702e6180492ca\">deaths</a> and more than a dozen cases of vision loss. That <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/eyedrops-infection-outbreak-fda-1e266befa854dc7c0ce65def0da9a0bc\">plant</a> had also never been previously inspected.</p><p>\u201cThese are very rare instances, but what we\u2019ve seen is that these products can cause real harm,\u201d said Dr. Timothy Janetos, an ophthalmologist at Northwestern University. \u201cSomething needs to change.\u201d</p><p>Experts point to three possible changes:</p><p>EARLIER INSPECTIONS</p><p>Prescription medicines are highly regulated. Before a drugmaker can sell one in the U.S., it must undergo FDA review to establish its safety and effectiveness. As part of the process, the FDA typically inspects the factory where the drug will be made.</p><p>But eyedrops and other over-the-counter products don\u2019t undergo preliminary review or inspections. Instead, they are governed by a different system called a monograph, essentially a generic recipe for all medicines in a particular class. So long as drugmakers attest that they are using the standard recipe, they can launch a product within days of filing with the FDA.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing more than electronic paperwork,\u201d said Dr. Sandra Brown of the Dry Eye Foundation, a nonprofit advocating for increased regulation. \u201cThere\u2019s no requirement for the facility to be inspected prior to shipping for sale.\u201d</p><p>The FDA says it has flexibility to adjust its review process \u201cto ensure safety.\"</p><p>But the agency is asking Congress for the power to require manufacturers of eyedrops and other sterile products to give at least six months notice before shipping products from a new factory. That would give inspectors time to visit facilities that aren\u2019t on their radar.</p><p>The proposal could face pushback from some over-the-counter drugmakers, who aren\u2019t accustomed to preapproval inspections.</p><p>But Brown says the unique risks of tainted eyedrops require a different approach from pills and tablets.</p><p>\u201cAnything you swallow is going to meet up with your stomach acid, which is going to kill most bacteria,\" Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s much more dangerous to put a product in your eye.\u201d</p><p>REQUIRING RECALLS</p><p>The FDA <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-warns-consumers-not-purchase-or-use-certain-eye-drops-several-major-brands-due-risk-eye\">warned consumers</a> in late October not to use the eyedrops sold at CVS, Rite-Aid and other stores. But the products weren\u2019t officially recalled until Nov. 15, almost three weeks later.</p><p>That's because Indian manufacturer, <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/kilitch-healthcare-india-limited-issues-voluntary-nationwide-recall-various-eye-drops-potential\">Kilitch Healthcare</a>, initially declined to cooperate. The FDA can force recalls of food, medical devices and many other products, but it lacks the same authority for drugs and instead must ask companies to voluntarily take action.</p><p>The FDA recently asked Congress for mandatory recall authority over drugs.</p><p>FUNDING FOREIGN INSPECTORS</p><p>Since the 1990s, drug manufacturing has increasingly moved to India, China and other lower-cost countries.</p><p>The Government Accountability Office has <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-103611\">raised concerns</a> for years about the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/india-china-us-news-medication-health-care-industry-699f56acec5542ffbc4aa95b8ce6a0cf\">FDA\u2019s oversight</a> of the global supply chain, flagging it as a <a href=\"https://files.gao.gov/reports/GAO-23-106203/index.html#appendix26\">\u201chigh-risk\u201d issue</a> for more than a decade.</p><p>The FDA said in a statement it uses \u201call available tools\u201d to ensure Americans get \u201chigh quality, safe and effective\u201d medications.</p><p>The agency generally prioritizes factories that have never been inspected or haven\u2019t been inspected in the last five years. It halted most routine, in-person foreign inspections in March 2020 and did not resume them until 2022. The agency didn\u2019t conduct any inspections in India during the first year of COVID-19.</p><p>FDA leaders have long said it's challenging to recruit and keep overseas inspectors.</p><p>Experts say Congress can and should address that.</p><p>\u201cFederal hiring is inherently slow and pay is often not competitive,\u201d said Ridley, the Duke researcher. \u201dCongress needs to try and help FDA solve that problem and then hold them responsible for staffing inspections.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
