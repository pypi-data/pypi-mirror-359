The survey was done by NORC at the University of Chicago and was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. It also found people who live in states where marijuana is illegal are more likely to use delta-8 THC. There is no government regulation of CBD and similar compounds, which are found in lotions, tinctures, candies, vapes and more.",

She was not involved in the JAMA study.</p><p>CBD and similar compounds have boomed in popularity since the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-fec2f67032ac4ccea09937d11dcac3f4\">2018 farm bill legalized hemp production</a>, and are found in lotions, tinctures, candies, vapes and more.

The FDA warned <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/what-you-need-know-and-what-were-working-find-out-about-products-containing-cannabis-or-cannabis\">CBD can cause liver injury and can poorly interact with certain medications</a>.</p><p>Delta-8 THC is of particular concern, because of adverse side effects and because of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-business-health-bdef53f20c34fe3adfd17a7808d5b4e6\">how it is chemically manufactured</a>.</p><p>Several states, including Colorado, ban or <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/delta8-thc-product-regulation-kentucky-14663ee751140dc3edb9e347e0442537\">regulate delta-8 THC</a>, though it is sold in many states due to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-business-health-bdef53f20c34fe3adfd17a7808d5b4e6\">a loophole in federal law.</a></p><p>\u201cThe implication in the paper, and I think it\u2019s accurate, is that if you don\u2019t have access to legal delta-9, then you\u2019re going to seek out delta-8,\u201d Bryan said. \"But we know even less about delta-8 than we do about delta-9.\"</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
