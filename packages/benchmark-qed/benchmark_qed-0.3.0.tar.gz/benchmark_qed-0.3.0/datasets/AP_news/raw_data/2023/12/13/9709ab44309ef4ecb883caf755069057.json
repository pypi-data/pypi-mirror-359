    "description_summary": "Missouri now has a statewide database to help doctors track opioid prescriptions. The program launched Wednesday. It's aimed at helping health care providers identify possible prescription drug addiction. Doctors and pharmacists can check the database to see if patients have been receiving painkillers and other opioids from multiple providers. Prescription information in the database can only be used for patient care and cannot be shared with law enforcement. Missouri in 2021 became the last state to adopt a statewide prescription drug monitoring program. It's taken about two years to implement.",
