    "description_summary": "Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have called for \u201ccompassion\u201d in the case of a woman whose health deteriorated as she unsuccessfully sought an abortion in Texas, but they stopped short of criticizing the state\u2019s law. The comments from the 2024 Republican nominee longshots are the latest indication that the candidates see the politics surrounding abortion as fraught for the GOP after the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of constitutional protections for the procedure helped power Democrats to unexpectedly strong midterm performances. Both expressed sympathy for the woman, Kate Cox, at campaign events Tuesday but have previously signed abortion restrictions into law in their states.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Some of the Republicans seeking their party's 2024 presidential nomination have said the case of a Texas woman whose health deteriorated as she unsuccessfully sought an abortion should be handled with \u201ccompassion,\u201d but they did not criticize the state's law.</p><p>It\u2019s the latest indication that the candidates see the politics surrounding abortion as a delicate \u2014 and fraught \u2014 issue for the GOP after the Supreme Court's reversal of constitutional protections for the procedure helped power Democrats to unexpectedly strong performances in the 2022 midterms.</p><p>While campaigning Tuesday, both former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis expressed sympathy for <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-kate-cox-texas-exceptions-e85664b2ab76bcb689b1b91913d3e33e\">Kate Cox</a>, a mother of two who sought an abortion after learning the baby she was carrying had a fatal genetic condition and suffering health complications of her own. Her request for an exemption from Texas\u2019 ban \u2014 one of the most restrictive in the U.S. \u2014 was ultimately denied by the state Supreme Court, and Cox <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-texas-ban-7d865cdfd75bdc6b2f4186f4d1e6e8bd\">left the state</a> to seek an abortion elsewhere.</p><p>Asked about Cox's case at a CNN town hall, DeSantis, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/florida-abortion-ban-approved-c9c53311a0b2426adc4b8d0b463edad1\">who signed a six-week ban in his state earlier this year</a>, said that \u201cthese are very difficult issues\u201d and pointed to Florida\u2019s exceptions allowing abortions when the mother\u2019s life is in danger or for a \u201cfatal fetal abnormality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to approach these issues with compassion,\u201d said DeSantis, though there have been reports in Florida of women <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/02/health/florida-abortion-term-pregnancy/index.html#:~:text=Florida%20law%20allows%20abortions%20after,the%20abnormality%20was%20truly%20fatal.\">who have not been able to obtain abortions</a> under the exception because their doctors, facing steep penalties if they are wrong, were unwilling to perform the procedure. The window of time for <a href=\"https://www.fox13news.com/news/despite-lethal-diagnoses-florida-abortion-law-blocks-families-from-termination\">women to make the wrenching choice</a> is also limited.</p><p>Haley also spoke of compassion and suggested Texas' medical board review the case. But she notably did not call for the law to be changed.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m pro-life. I welcome the states that have become pro-life. But this is exactly why I\u2019ve said you have to show compassion and humanize the situation,\" said Haley, who signed abortion restrictions after about 20 weeks into law as South Carolina governor in 2016. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any women to sit there and deal with a rare situation and have to deliver a baby in that sort of circumstance, any more than we want women getting an abortion at 37, 38, 39 weeks\" \u2014 a rare occurrence generally due to grave medical complications.</p><p>President Joe Biden has called the Texas ruling \u201csimply outrageous\" and said what happened to Cox \u201cshould never happen in America, period.\u201d</p><p>Many Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, have been reluctant to stake out clear positions on what restrictions they support, including <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mike-pence-abortion-views-2024-election-e5b236c27bc9c86f77efedbeedb26520\">bans on abortion even when doctors determine a pregnancy is not viable</a> and a baby will not survive outside the womb.</p><p>Much of that reluctance may be due to public sentiment, which favors abortion rights. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll this past summer <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-poll-roe-dobbs-ban-opinion-fcfdfc5a799ac3be617d99999e92eabe\">found that about two-thirds</a> of Americans said abortion should generally be legal. Voters have either affirmed abortion access or turned back attempts to undermine it in all seven states where the question has been on the ballot since Roe v. Wade's reversal.</p><p>Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was alone among the 2024 Republican candidates in declaring that the Texas Supreme Court erred in denying the abortion. He said Texas legislators should change their law.</p><p>\u201cI think the Texas Supreme Court was wrong. And I think that, in a situation like this, you\u2019re not protecting any life because the child clearly has been diagnosed with having a fatal illness,\" Christie told The Associated Press on Wednesday. \"So all you\u2019re doing is putting the life of the mother at risk by making her carry it to term.\u201d</p><p>Former President Donald Trump, who has taken credit for appointing the Supreme Court justices who helped overturn national abortion protections, has not issued any statement on the Texas case, and his campaign did not respond to messages Wednesday inquiring about his stance.</p><p>Another GOP presidential candidate, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, has not spoken out about Cox\u2019s case. He said in a video on X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday night that the Supreme Court was correct to overturn Roe, that states should decide their own abortion restrictions and that Republicans should campaign on the idea of \u201csexual responsibility for men\u201d by allowing any woman who carries a pregnancy to term to legally make the father solely responsible for caring for the child.</p><p>Cox's case and others like hers \u201cprove exceptions don't exist in reality,\u201d said Angela Vasquez-Giroux, vice president of communications and research for the national group Reproductive Freedom for All.</p><p>\u201cIf politicians like DeSantis and Haley really believed in exceptions and in compassion, they would have been fighting to find ways to work with doctors to clarify these laws and to help people facing these nightmarish situations in their own states to access care,\" she said. \u201cThey threw compassion out the window the moment they signed these bans.\u201d</p><p>Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the national anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America, also called for \u201ccompassion and care and dignity\u201d for the mother and child but said Texas' law gives doctors the ability to perform an abortion if they determine a woman has a life-threatening condition or is in risk of impairment of a major bodily function.</p><p>The Texas law, however, is vague on how close to death a patient must be to get the procedure, and lawmakers have refused to clarify and amend the measure.</p><p>Christie, who is anti-abortion, nonetheless believes regulations on the procedure should be left to the states, not the federal government.</p><p>He said the Texas case demonstrates \u201cwhy so many people don\u2019t trust certain members of my party with this issue, because either they are completely unmovable on it, no matter what the facts are, or they say nice words but are unwilling to take a position.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Fernando reported from Chicago, and Price reported from New York.

While it does touch on health-related issues, such as the health complications faced by the woman seeking an abortion and the implications of restrictive abortion laws on women's health, the main emphasis is on the political discourse and legal interpretations rather than on health as a standalone topic. Therefore, the document is somewhat relevant to health but not highly focused on it."
