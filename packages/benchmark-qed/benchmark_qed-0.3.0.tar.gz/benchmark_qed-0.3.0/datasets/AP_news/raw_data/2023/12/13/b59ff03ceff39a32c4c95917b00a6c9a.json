The sheriff's office says the gummies tested negative for foreign substances, but residue in the bag that contained the gummies tested positive for fentanyl in a field test.

(AP) \u2014 A group of Virginia elementary school students sought medical attention Tuesday after eating gummy bears from a bag that contained residue that tested positive for fentanyl, according to the county sheriff\u2019s office.</p><p>Seven students at Central Elementary School experienced a reaction after eating the gummy bears at school on Tuesday, the Amherst County Sheriff\u2019s office said in a news release. School administrators notified the children\u2019s families and five of the seven students sought medical treatment, Amherst County Public Schools officials said in a news release.</p><p>Two were taken to hospitals by county EMS and three by their parents, County Public Safety Director Brad Beam said at a news conference. The students were experiencing nausea or were vomiting or lethargic, he said.</p><p>The gummies tested negative for foreign substances, but residue in the plastic bag that contained the gummies tested positive for fentanyl in a field test, sheriff's office spokesperson Lt. Dallas Hill said.</p><p>As part of the investigation, the sheriff's office executed a search warrant at a home in the county and arrested two people who were charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, Hill said. One was also charged with possession of a schedule I or II drug and the other was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.</p><p>The students were all fourth graders in the same class at the school and all returned home Tuesday evening, Superintendent William Wells said at a news conference on Wednesday. It is believed that the bag was contaminated at home or on the way to school, he said. A sibling of the child who brought the gummies to school in the contaminated bag also had a bag of gummy bears at school, but it did not test positive for fentanyl, Wells said.</p>",
