The drugmaker expects sales for both the treatment, Paxlovid, and the vaccine, Comirnaty, to total $8 billion in 2024, according to an initial forecast the drugmaker released Wednesday. Analysts expect nearly $14 billion combined sales, according to FactSet. Those products combined to rake in more than $56 billion in sales last year. But both Pfizer and the Street expected a decline as demand waned and the drugmaker switched to selling through the commercial market.",

That falls more than $5 billion short of estimates on Wall Street.</p><p>The company\u2019s forecast for overall earnings and revenue next year also missed consensus. Pfizer shares continued their largely year-long slide in midday trading.</p><p>Pfizer leaders told analysts Wednesday that they expect vaccination and treatment rates to be about the same next year as they were in 2023. But they wanted to be conservative and offer a \u201cgood floor\u201d for expectations to avoid creating any more uncertainty, CEO Albert Bourla said.</p><p>In mid-October, Pfizer said sales of both the vaccine and treatment were turning out weaker than expected. The company cut revenue projections for this year by $9 billion. Two weeks later, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pfizer-covid19-earnings-pharmaceutical-6cdf517cb52b38865d7e0b899a2d9056\">Pfizer said</a> sales of the treatment and vaccine had slid 97% and 70%, respectively, in the third quarter.</p><p>Comirnaty and Paxlovid combined to rake in more than $56 billion in sales last year, easily making them Pfizer's two top-selling products.</p><p>But a down year for both was widely expected as demand slid and drugmakers switched to selling on the commercial market instead relying on the more stable payout of bulk government contracts.</p><p>Bourla also noted Wednesday in a call with analysts that the virus that triggered a global pandemic in 2020 is no longer \u201ctop of mind,\u201d and that there\u2019s some COVID-19 fatigue and anti-vaccine rhetoric in the market.</p><p>Chief Financial Officer David Denton also called the virus unpredictable and said it was hard to model its performance. Even so, he said Pfizer expects both the market-leading treatment and vaccine to remain significant products.</p><p>\u201cThey meet a very large and high unmet need of the patient population around the globe,\u201d he said.</p><p>The company said that it expects full-year revenue in 2024 of between $58.5 billion and $61.5 billion, short of the $62.7 billion that Wall Street was expecting, according to a survey of industry analysts by FactSet.</p><p>The New York drugmaker expects to post per-share earnings of between $2.05 and $2.25 next year. Wall Street was projecting earnings of around $3.17 per share.</p><p>Pfizer also said that it was expanding its cost-cutting program by $500 million. Company leaders noted that recently acquired <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pfizer-seagen-acquisition-cancer-05b11f085125df5941f64a2ecbb5abba\">cancer treatment developer Seagen</a> will start contributing revenue in the new year.</p><p>The company said it had no plans to cut its quarterly dividend which now totals 41 cents per share.</p><p>Shares of Pfizer Inc. slid more than 8% to $26.12 in late-morning trading while broader indexes climbed.</p><p>The stock had already already shed more than 44% of its value so far this year.</p>",
