    "description_summary": "New gene therapies promise a cure for sickle cell disease but experts say they are out of reach in places that need them the most. Vast inequities cut much of the world off from gene therapy in general, a whole new class of treatments that aims to eradicate inherited diseases by changing DNA. Such therapies are among the most expensive in the world. They can also be extremely complex to give patients, requiring specialized equipment and long hospital stays. Many parts of the developing world simply don\u2019t have the resources. The sickle cell treatments were recently approved in Britain, Bahrain and the U.S.",

Vast inequities cut much of the world off from gene therapy in general.</p><p>While access to all sorts of medicine is limited in developing countries, the problem is especially acute with these therapies, some of the most expensive treatments in the world.</p><p>Beyond their sky-high prices, these therapies are extremely complex to give patients because they require long hospitalizations, sophisticated medical equipment and specially trained doctors. So far, the two gene therapies for sickle cell have only been approved in wealthier countries: both <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/sickle-cell-fda-approval-vertex-crispr-8d85279d7de0c60888d37afbfa06d39e\">in the U.S</a>., and one <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/sickle-cell-gene-therapy-treatment-uk-first-9bcf7c7d8b8909fb06e137fee17c767c\">in Britain</a> and Bahrain as well.</p><p>\u201cThe vast, vast majority of patients live in an area where they have no access to this kind of therapy,\u201d said Dr. Benjamin Watkins, who treats sickle cell at Children's Hospital New Orleans. \u201cWe as medical professionals, and as a society, have to think about that.\u201d</p><p>Access to gene therapies was a major focus of this year\u2019s international summit on human genome editing in London. A <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01389-z\">subsequent editorial</a> in the journal Nature said high prices leave low- and middle-income countries \u201centirely in the lurch\u201d and could stymie progress across the field.</p><p>Some scientists worry that new cures won\u2019t reach their potential, future treatments may never be invented and the prospect of wiping out diseases like sickle cell will remain a distant dream.</p><p>STRUGGLING FOR BASIC TREATMENT</p><p>For gene therapy to even be an option, people in developing nations must stay alive long enough to get it. There, sickle cell disease is more likely to disable or kill than in wealthy regions. Late diagnosis is common and basic care can be hard to come by.</p><p>Sickle cell disease affects hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. A genetic mutation causes the cells to become crescent-shaped, which can block blood flow and cause problems such as excruciating pain and organ damage.</p><p>Global estimates of how many people have the disease vary, but <a href=\"https://www.healthdata.org/research-analysis/library/global-regional-and-national-prevalence-and-mortality-burden-sickle-cell#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20people%20living,9%C2%B72)%20in%202021.\">some researchers</a> put the number between 6 million and 8 million \u2014 with more than 1 million in India and more than 5 million in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>Dongre, who lives in Nagpur in central India, has seen the struggles in his own family and among people he\u2019s met as a leader of India's National Alliance of Sickle Cell Organizations.</p><p>He recalled how his newborn son Girish cried constantly from stomach and leg pain. Doctors didn\u2019t diagnose him with sickle cell for 2 1/2 years. When their daughter Sumedha was born, he and his wife had her tested immediately and learned she had the disease too.</p><p>Available treatments can reduce the bouts of pain known as \u201ccrises.\u201d Dongre\u2019s children, now 19 and 13, take hydroxyurea, a decades-old chemo drug that helps prevent the formation of sickle-shaped red blood cells and control the disease.</p><p>Other patients in rural areas are dying at very young ages without getting the right treatments, Dongre said.</p><p>The situation is much the same in East Africa's Tanzania.</p><p>Mazeze scrambled for information after her son, Ian Harely, was diagnosed.</p><p>\u201cI Googled and Googled and I couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d said Mazeze, executive director of the Tanzania Sickle Cell Warriors Organization. \u201cAfter that, I was praying. It was God and Google.\u201d</p><p>Her son is now 10 and takes hydroxyurea and folic acid for anemia. They\u2019ve helped, but haven\u2019t eliminated pain episodes.</p><p>Still, Mazeze counts herself lucky she can afford treatment at all. She said some in Tanzania can't even pay for folic acid, which costs less than a dollar.</p><p>\u2019SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES\u2019</p><p>Such stark realities make the cost of gene therapies an insurmountable obstacle, experts say. The price tags for the two sickle cell therapies in the U.S. are $3.1 million and $2.2 million although costs can vary by country.</p><p>The process of giving the therapies is just as big a hurdle.</p><p>Patients must go to the hospital, where stem cells are removed from their blood. One treatment, made by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics, involves quickly sending the cells to a lab and using a gene-editing tool <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nobel-prizes-united-states-technology-science-europe-14ba023fa7a90b34df2d7a6d0314c796\">called CRISPR</a> to knock out a gene.</p><p>The other therapy, made by Bluebird Bio, doesn\u2019t use CRISPR but involves the same process for patients. They must undergo chemotherapy before they get back their altered cells, and spend weeks in the hospital. The process can stretch on for months.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s great unmet need, but there are also significant challenges,\u201d said Dr. David Altshuler, chief scientific officer at Vertex.</p><p>Scientists are working to make easier-to-administer versions of the new therapies. Altshuler's team is trying to develop a pill that wouldn\u2019t edit genes but would have the same goal: helping the body produce a fetal form of hemoglobin since the adult form is defective in people with sickle cell.</p><p>But experts say simpler cures will likely still be unaffordable to many, so foundations and governments will be instrumental in getting them to patients.</p><p>If the gene therapy eventually makes it to India, Dongre would like his children to be among the first to get it. Mazeze said she may wait to see how other patients fare but will consider it for her son too.</p><p>Both agreed it should be an option in all countries \u2014 rich or poor.</p><p>\u201cWe all are part of one single planet,\u201d Dongre said.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
