The push comes on the heels of an amendment that Ohio voters approved last month that ensures access to abortion and other reproductive health care. It took effect last week. A law signed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in April 2019 prohibited most abortions after the first detectable \u201cfetal heartbeat.\u201d The law had been blocked through a federal legal challenge, briefly went into effect when the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision was overturned, and then was again put on hold in county court.",
