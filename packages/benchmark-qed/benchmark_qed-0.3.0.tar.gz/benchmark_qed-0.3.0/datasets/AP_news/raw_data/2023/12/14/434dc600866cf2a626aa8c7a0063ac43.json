The fruity disposable products have become the top choice among underage American teens who vape. The Food and Drug Administration pegged the value of the e-cigarettes seized at Los Angeles Airport at $18 million. Many were mislabeled as toys, shoes and other household items in order to evade customs, officials said. In May, the FDA instructed customs officials to begin seizing shipments from the Chinese manufacturer behind Elf Bar. It\u2019s the first time U.S. authorities have reported successfully blocking the company's imports.",

The involvement of the FDA and the impact on teen vaping habits are directly related to health concerns. However, the document also includes details about the logistics of the seizure and the companies involved, which are less directly related to health. Overall, the primary focus on the health implications of illegal e-cigarettes justifies a high relevance rating."
