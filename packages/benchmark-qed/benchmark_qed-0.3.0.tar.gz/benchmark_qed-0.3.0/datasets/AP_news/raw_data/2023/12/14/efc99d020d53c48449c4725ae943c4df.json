The White House has unveiled a list of 48 drugs that drugmakers will have to pay rebates to the federal government on due to raising their prices higher than the cost of inflation during this year. These include drugs for chemotherapy treatments and growth hormones used to treat endocrine disorders. The rebates will translate into a wide range of savings \u2014 as little as $1 to as much as $2,700 \u2014 on the drugs for Medicare members in 2024. This is the first time those drugs will be penalized for their prices.",

The money will be used to lower the price Medicare enrollees pay on the drugs early next year.</p><p>\u201cFor years, there's been no check on how high or how fast big pharma can raise drug prices,\u201d President Joe Biden said Thursday, speaking in a lab at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \u201cLet\u2019s call this for what it is \u2013 it simply is a rip off. They\u2019re ripping off Medicare. They\u2019re ripping off the American people. We\u2019re now fighting back.\u201d</p><p>This is the first time drugmakers will have to pay the penalties for outpatient drug treatments under the Inflation Reduction Act, passed by Congress last year. The rebates will translate into a wide range of savings \u2014 from as little as $1 to as much as $2,700 \u2014 on the drugs that the White House estimates are used every year by 750,000 older Americans.</p><p>The types of drugs on the government's list vary. They include generic drugs, medications taken orally or injected, and treat a variety of disorders or illnesses, according to a review by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists of the administration's list.</p><p>But all of the drugs, the White House said, raised their prices significantly this year, many by nearly 20%.</p><p>The price decreases will only be seen for patients who access the drugs on Medicare Part B, the government outpatient care coverage. But the rebates are \u201can important tool to discourage excessive price increases,\" Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, said Thursday in a statement.</p><p>Only a small number of drugs met the criteria for penalties, pointed out Stephen Ubl, the president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, also called PhRMA.</p><p>\"It\u2019s a tiny fraction of overall working medicines,\u201d he said.</p><p>As it readies for a 2024 reelection campaign, the Biden administration has rolled out a number of efforts to push pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices. Last week, the White House announced it was considering an aggressive, unprecedented new tactic: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-drug-prices-patents-2024-campaign-f92da4ee89814d3ab89a909399bf4c85\">pulling the patents of some drugs priced out of reach for most Americans</a>.</p><p>\u201cOn no. We've upset Big Pharma again,\u201d the White House <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1732818507279024210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1732818507279024210%7Ctwgr%5E4701332d12eabccfa0403cf617c2812e1d766fef%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2023%2F12%2F07%2Fbiden-administration-asserts-power-to-seize-drug-patents.html\">posted on the social media platform X</a>, formerly Twitter, last week, just hours after the announcement.</p><p>The president plans to make his push for lower drug prices a central theme of his reelection pitch to Americans.</p><p>The U.S. Health and Human Services agency also released <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/4bf549a55308c3aadc74b34abcb7a1d1/ira-drug-negotiation-report.pdf\">a report</a> on Thursday that will help guide its first-ever negotiation process with drugmakers over the price of 10 of Medicare's costliest drugs. The new prices for those drugs will be negotiated by HHS next year, in the middle of next year's presidential campaign.</p><p>___</p><p>This story has been corrected to show that the National Institutes of Health in in Bethesda, MD, not Washington, D.C.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Associated Press writer Tom Murphy in Indianapolis contributed.</p>",
