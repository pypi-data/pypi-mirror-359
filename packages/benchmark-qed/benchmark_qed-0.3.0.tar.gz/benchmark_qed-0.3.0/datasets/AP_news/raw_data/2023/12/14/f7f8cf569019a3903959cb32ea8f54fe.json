Urologist Francis Martinis and his wife, Jessica Martinis, were each charged Thursday with criminal sale of a prescription for a controlled substance by a practitioner and falsifying business records. Prosecutors say Francis Martinis transmitted prescriptions for the opioid drug oxycodone with the names of \u201cBelow Deck\u201d cast members listed as the patients. The couple's attorney has called the charges bogus.",
