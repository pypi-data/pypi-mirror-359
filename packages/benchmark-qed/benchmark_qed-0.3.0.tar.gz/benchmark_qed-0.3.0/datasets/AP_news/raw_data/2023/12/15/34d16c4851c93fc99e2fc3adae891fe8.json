There was some hope that children in a government food program might be bucking a trend in obesity rates. Earlier research found rates had dropped a little for those children. But an update published Monday in the journal Pediatrics shows the rate up a bit to 2% by 2020. The increase echoes national data, which suggests around 2.5% of all preschool-aged children are severely obese. The study involved young kids in the Women, Infants and Children program, which provides healthy foods and other services.",

But an <a href=\"https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/online-first?autologincheck=redirected\">update released Monday</a> in the journal Pediatrics shows the rate bounced back up a bit by 2020.</p><p>The increase echoes other national data, which suggests around 2.5% of all preschool-aged children were severely obese during the same period.</p><p>\"We were doing well and now we see this upward trend,\u201d said one of the study\u2019s authors, Heidi Blanck of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cWe are dismayed at seeing these findings.\u201d</p><p>The study looked at children ages 2 to 4 enrolled in the Women, Infants and Children <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic\">program</a>, which provides healthy foods and other services to preschool-aged children in low-income families. The children were weighed and measured.</p><p>The researchers found that 2.1% of kids in the program were severely obese in 2010. Six years later, the rate had dipped to 1.8%. But by 2020, it was 2%. That translates to about 33,000 of more than 1.6 million kids in the WIC program.</p><p>Significant increases were seen in 20 states with the highest rate in California at 2.8%. There also were notable rises in some racial and ethnic groups. The highest rate, about 2.8%, was in Hispanic kids.</p><p>Experts say severe obesity at a very early age is nearly irreversible, and is strongly associated with chronic health problems and an early death.</p><p>It\u2019s not clear why the increase occurred, Blanck said.</p><p>When WIC obesity rates dropped, some experts attributed it to 2009 policy changes that eliminated juice from infant food packages, provided less saturated fat, and tried to make it easier to buy fruits and vegetables.</p><p>The package hasn\u2019t changed. But \u201cthe daily hardships that families living in poverty are facing may be harder today than they were 10 years ago, and the slight increases in the WIC package just weren\u2019t enough,\u201d said Dr. Sarah Armstrong, a Duke University childhood obesity researcher.</p><p>The researchers faced challenges. The number of kids in WIC declined in the past decade. And the study period included 2020, the year the COVID-19 pandemic hit, when fewer parents brought their children in to see doctors. That reduced the amount of complete information available.</p><p>Despite it\u2019s limitations, it was a \u201cvery well done study,\" said Deanna Hoelscher, a childhood obesity researcher at the UTHealth Houston School of Public Health, \u201cIt gives you a hint of what's going on.\u201d</p><p>What's happened since 2020 is not yet known. Some small studies have suggested a marked increase in childhood obesity \u2014 especially during the pandemic, when kids were kept home from schools, eating and bedtime routines were disrupted and physical activity decreased.</p><p>\u201cWe are thinking it's going to get worse,\u201d Hoelscher said.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
