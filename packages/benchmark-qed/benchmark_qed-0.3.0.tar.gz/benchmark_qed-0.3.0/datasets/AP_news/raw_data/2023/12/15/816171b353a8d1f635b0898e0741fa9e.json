Voters overwhelmingly passed November\u2019s Issue 1, which guaranteed an individual\u2019s right \u201cto make and carry out one\u2019s own reproductive decisions.\u201d That made Ohio the seventh state to support abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned last summer. Filings Friday show Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, the pro campaign, raised and spent more than $39.5 million to pass the constitutional amendment. Protect Women Ohio, the no campaign, raised and spent about $30.4 million. A successful recreational marijuana legalization effort cost about a tenth of the abortion rights fight's total.",

Anthony Pro Life America.</p><p>Over the three years it took supporters of recreational marijuana legalization to get their initiated statute passed as this fall's Issue 2, they only spent about a tenth of what the abortion fight cost.</p><p>The Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, the pro campaign, raised and spent roughly $6.5 million since its inception in 2021, with the bulk of its contributions coming from the Marijuana Policy Project, a Washington, D.C.-based marijuana legalization nonprofit \u2014 which donated about $3 million over that time period \u2014 and from medical marijuana dispensaries across the state.</p><p>Protect Ohio Workers and Families, the opposition campaign that only sprung up earlier this year, raised only $828,000, reports show. Its largest donor was the American Policy Coalition, a conservative nonprofit organization out of Alexandria, Virginia, which donated about $320,000.</p><p>Other notable donors included the Ohio Manufacturers\u2019 Association and the Ohio Hospital Association.</p><p>___</p><p>Samantha Hendrickson is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
