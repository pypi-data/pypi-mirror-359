The move is part of an experiment to regulate the pot trade in the Netherlands. But it could mark the beginning of the end for a long-standing legal anomaly: people can buy and sell small amounts of weed without fear of prosecution in the country, but growing it commercially remains illegal. The chairperson of the Union for the Abolition of Cannabis Prohibition calls it a \"very, very big step in the right direction.",

The plan for the experiment dates back to 2017 and is seen as as a way of providing \u201cquality-controlled\" weed to coffeeshops \u2014 places that are allowed to sell marijuana \u2014 and shutting out illegal growers.</p><p>\u201cBy regulating the sale of cannabis, we have a better insight into the origin of the products and the quality,\u201d Kuipers said. \u201cIn addition, we can better inform consumers about the effects and health risks of cannabis use.\u201d</p><p>Bart Vollenberg, who grows cannabis for the experiment, called it a \u201chappy day for the Netherlands.\u201d</p><p>\"The most significant advantage is that it is not criminal activity, and it becomes transparent,\" he said. \"You can test the weed in the laboratory. With all the knowledge and skills of Dutch horticulture, we can start improving the quality of the weed now. No longer need to make all kinds of twists and turns in illegality.\u201d</p><p>A trailblazer in decriminalizing pot since the 1970s, the Netherlands has grown more conservative. Amsterdam, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/1800038fe0d63179879062e13fe38df2\">long a magnet</a> for marijuana smokers from around the world, has been closing coffeeshops in recent years and has banned smoking weed on some of the cobbled streets that make up its historic center.</p><p>Across the nation, there are 565 coffeeshops. That is down from around 2,000 \u201cin the real heyday,\u201d Bergman said.</p><p>Meanwhile, other countries around the world and some U.S. states have taken steps to legalize the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/recreational-marijuana\">recreational use of cannabis</a>.</p><p>\u201cWe are finally taking a small place on the international stage back again,\" Bergman said. \"It\u2019s not like we\u2019re back full on. It\u2019s a small experiment.\u201d</p><p>Friday marked the first day of what the government calls the \u201cclosed coffeeshop chain experiment.\u201d The initial phase is scheduled to last a maximum of six months and could then be rolled out to 11 municipalities across the Netherlands.</p><p>\u201cDuring the startup phase, growers, coffeeshop owners, transporters and supervisors will gain experience with the supply and sale of regulated cannabis and its supervision, secure transport and the use of the track and trace system,\u201d the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport said in a statement.</p><p>Coffeeshops in Breda and nearby Tilburg are allowed to have a maximum of 500 grams (17.64 ounces) of weed from legal growers in stock at a time.</p><p>Breda Mayor Paul Depla said the initial experiment in his city and Tilburg would help detect any \u201cgrowing pains\u201d in the system.</p><p>\u201cIt is also a great opportunity to see how cooperation within the closed chain between legal growers, coffeeshop owners and all other authorities involved works,\u201d he said.</p><p>The Trimbos Institute, a Dutch organization that raises awareness about mental health and the use of drugs, alcohol and tobacco, is involved in the experiment and promoting measures to prevent cannabis use.</p><p>\u201cWe think it's important that people who use cannabis are well informed about the risks and options for help,\u201d spokeswoman Harri\u00ebtte Koop said in an email.</p><p>For longtime campaigner Bergman, an upside of the new policy is that smokers can now easily see who grew the cannabis they are using and let friends know whether it's any good.</p><p>\u201cIt's a relief that the weed is quite good,\u201d he said, smiling as he lit his marijuana cigarette in a small puff of thick white smoke.</p><p>There is a downside, Bergman added. He looked at a plastic beaker in a plastic bag holding the new legally grown weed and a much smaller plastic container for illegal pot.</p><p>\u201cThe new system produces much more plastic waste,\u201d he noted.</p>",
