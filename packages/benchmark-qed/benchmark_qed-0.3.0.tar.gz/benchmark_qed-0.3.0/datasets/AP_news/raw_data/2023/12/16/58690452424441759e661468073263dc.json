Her case has sparked a national firestorm over the plight of pregnant women, especially women of color, following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Supporters have rallied around Watts and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump elevated her plight on X. Police say Watts tried to plunge the contents of her miscarriage and left the fetus stuck in the pipes. Her attorney says Watts is being demonized for a common natural occurrence.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Ohio was in the throes of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/election-2023-abortion-rights-ohio-e3edc16a1bfaa22b9e72bc1d6fb76dd0\">a bitter debate over abortion rights</a> this fall when Brittany Watts, 21 weeks and 5 days pregnant, began passing thick blood clots.</p><p>The 33-year-old Watts, who had not shared the news of her pregnancy even with her family, made her first prenatal visit to a doctor\u2019s office behind Mercy Health-St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital in Warren, a working-class city about 60 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of Cleveland.</p><p>The doctor said that, while a fetal heartbeat was still present, Watts\u2019 water had broken prematurely and the fetus she was carrying would not survive. He advised heading to the hospital to have her labor induced, so she could have what amounted to an abortion to deliver the nonviable fetus. Otherwise, she would face \u201csignificant risk\u201d of death, records of her case show.</p><p>That was a Tuesday in September. What followed was a harrowing three days entailing: multiple trips to the hospital; Watts miscarrying into, and then flushing and plunging, a toilet at her home; a police investigation of those actions; and Watts, who is Black, being charged with abuse of a corpse. That\u2019s a fifth-degree felony punishable by up to a year in prison and a $2,500 fine.</p><p>Her case was sent last month to a grand jury. It has touched off a national firestorm over the treatment of pregnant women, and especially Black women, in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization decision that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0\">overturned Roe v. Wade.</a></p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/death-of-george-floyd-race-and-ethnicity-5d55136da447c4231870f1400cd47e13\">Civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump</a> elevated Watts\u2019 plight in a post to X, formerly Twitter.</p><p>Michele Goodwin, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, and author of \u201cPolicing The Womb,\u201d said the case follows a pattern of women's pregnancies being criminalized against them. She said those efforts have long overwhelmingly targeted Black and brown women.</p><p>Even before Roe was overturned, studies show that Black women who visited hospitals for prenatal care were 10 times more likely than white women to have child protective services and law enforcement called on them, even when their cases were similar, she said.</p><p>\u201cPost-Dobbs, what we see is kind of a wild, wild West,\u201d said Goodwin. \u201cYou see this kind of muscle-flexing by district attorneys and prosecutors wanting to show that they are going to be vigilant, they\u2019re going to take down women who violate the ethos coming out of the state\u2019s legislature.\u201d</p><p>She called Black women \u201ccanaries in the coal mine\u201d for the \u201chyper-vigilant type of policing\u201d women of all races might expect from the nation\u2019s network of health-care providers, law enforcers and courts now that abortion isn\u2019t federally protected.</p><p>At the time of Watts\u2019 miscarriage, abortion was legal in Ohio through 21 weeks, six days of pregnancy. Her lawyer, Traci Timko, said Watts sat for eight hours at Mercy Health-St. Joseph\u2019s awaiting care on the eve of her pregnancy reaching 22 weeks, before leaving without being treated.</p><p>Timko said hospital officials had been deliberating over the legalities.</p><p>\u201cIt was the fear of, is this going to constitute an abortion and are we able to do that,\u201d Timko said. The hospital didn\u2019t return calls seeking confirmation and comment.</p><p>But B. Jessie Hill, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, said the hospital was in a bind.</p><p>\u201cThese are the razor\u2019s edge decisions that health care providers are being forced to make,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd all the incentives are pushing hospitals to be conservative, because on the other side of this is criminal liability.\u201d</p><p>Warren Assistant Prosecutor Lewis Guarnieri told Warren Municipal Court Judge Terry Ivanchak during Watts' preliminary hearing that she left home for a hair appointment after miscarrying, leaving the toilet clogged. Police would later find the fetus wedged in the pipes.</p><p>\u201cThe issue isn\u2019t how the child died, when the child died,\u201d Guarnieri told the judge, according to TV station WKBN. \u201cIt\u2019s the fact the baby was put into a toilet, was large enough to clog up the toilet, left in that toilet, and she went on (with) her day.\u201d</p><p>In court, Timko bristled.</p><p>\u201cThis 33-year-old girl with no criminal record is demonized for something that goes on every day,\u201d she said.</p><p>The size and stage of development of Watts\u2019 fetus became an issue during her preliminary hearing.</p><p>At the time, vigorous campaigning over <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ohio-abortion-amendment-election-2023-fe3e06747b616507d8ca21ea26485270\">Issue 1,</a> an ultimately successful amendment to enshrine a right to abortion in Ohio\u2019s constitution, included ads alleging the amendment would <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/election-2023-abortion-amendment-ohio-strategy-610e427f753a6803e4a59b7af8aa744f\">allow abortions \u201cuntil birth.\u201d</a></p><p>A county forensic investigator reported feeling \u201cwhat appeared to be a small foot with toes\u201d inside Watts\u2019 toilet. Police seized the toilet and broke it apart to retrieve the intact fetus as evidence. An autopsy confirmed that the fetus died in utero before passing through the birth canal and identified \u201cno recent injuries.\u201d</p><p>The judge acknowledged the case\u2019s complexities when he bound the case over to the grand jury.</p><p>\u201cThere are better scholars than I am to determine the exact legal status of this fetus, corpse, body, birthing tissue, whatever it is,\u201d he said from the bench.</p><p>Assistant Trumbull County Prosecutor Diane Barber, lead prosecutor on Watts\u2019 case, could not speak specifically about the case, other than to note the county is compelled to move forward with it. She doesn\u2019t expect a grand jury finding this month.</p><p>Timko, a former prosecutor, said Ohio\u2019s abuse-of-corpse statute is vague.</p><p>\u201cFrom a legal perspective, there\u2019s no definition of \u2018corpse,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cCan you be a corpse if you never took a breath?\u201d</p><p>Grace Howard, assistant justice studies professor at San Jos\u00e9 State University, said clarity on what about Watts\u2019 behavior constituted a crime is essential.</p><p>\u201cHer miscarriage was entirely ordinary,\" she said. \"So I just want to know what (the prosecutor) thinks she should have done. If we are going to require people to collect and bring used menstrual products to hospitals so that they can make sure it is indeed a miscarriage, it\u2019s as ridiculous and invasive as it is cruel.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>This story corrects that case was sent to a grand jury last month, not last week.</p>",
