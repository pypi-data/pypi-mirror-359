The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there have been no cases in humans.",

But in later stages, animals may exhibit listlessness, lowering of the head, weight loss, repetitive walking in set patterns and a lack of responsiveness. There are no treatments or vaccines for the disease and, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/prions/cwd/index.html#:~:text=To%20date%2C%20there%20have%20been,from%20infected%20deer%20or%20elk.\">according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, there have been no cases in humans.</p><p>Samples have been collected from more than 1,700 white-tailed deer harvested statewide, with 420 of those collected within the CMZ this hunting season, the department said. One of the positive samples was submitted during a mandatory sampling weekend on Dec. 2 and 3. The other positive was voluntarily submitted at a drop-off location by a hunter as part of the department's monitoring program.</p><p>The next mandatory sampling weekend is Jan. 6 and 7.</p><p>Department of Conservation and Natural Resource Commissioner Chris Blankenship thanked hunters for providing a \u201crobust\u201d number of samples.</p><p>\u201cHunters are our most important partners in the management of CWD as we move forward with future deer seasons,\u201d he said.</p>",

While the primary focus is on wildlife, the document also touches on health-related aspects such as the disease's impact on the brain, the lack of treatments or vaccines, and the fact that there have been no cases in humans according to the CDC. This makes the document relevant to the topic of health, particularly in the context of zoonotic diseases and public health monitoring."
