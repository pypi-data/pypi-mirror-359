The DNR announced Monday that it will begin accepting applications for grants on Jan. 16. The grants will help water systems that serve non-residential groups of at least 25 people for more than six months annually, such as schools and day care centers, and non-government water systems that serve at least 25 people year-round, such as mobile home parks and apartment buildings. The grants will be funded through the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.",
