The recalled pouches have been linked to dozens of illnesses in U.S. kids. The cinnamon samples contained lead levels more than 2,000 times higher than a maximum level proposed by the Food and Drug Administration. At least 125 children may have been sickened by lead poisoning after consuming the WanaBana pouches and other brands sold at the Dollar Tree stores and elsewhere. The FDA said Monday the agency is continuing to investigate.",

The recalled pouches have been linked to dozens of illnesses in U.S. kids.</p><p>Cinnamon <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wanabana-fruit-pouch-cinnamon-applesauce-ecuador-8a7bba763e7fdb79688dea6b2be79007\">tested from the plant</a> had lead levels more than 2,000 times higher than a maximum level proposed by the FDA, officials said.</p><p>The samples came from ground or powdered cinnamon from Negasmart, an Ecuadorian company that supplied the spice to Austrofoods, which made the pouches. The applesauce pouches were sold under three brands \u2014 WanaBana, Schnucks and Weis. Officials with Austrofoods did not respond to requests for comment about the investigation.</p><p>FDA said lead has not been detected in WanaBana products made without cinnamon and sold in the U.S.</p><p>The agency continues to investigate how the cinnamon was contaminated. Jim Jones, who heads the agency\u2019s human foods program, said in an interview <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/14/applesauce-pouches-may-have-been-contaminated-on-purpose-fda-foods-chief-says-00131797#:~:text=Tainted%20cinnamon%20applesauce%20pouches%20that,the%20midst%20of%20our%20investigation\">with Politico</a> last week that the lead contamination appeared to be \u201can intentional act.\"</p><p>One theory is that the cinnamon may have been contaminated for economic reasons, agency officials said. That could mean an ingredient is added or subtracted from a food to to boost its value. For example, compounds like red brick, red lead salt, lead oxide and lead chromate, which mirror cinnamon\u2019s red color, have been added to increase the value of the spice, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30646970/\">research shows.</a></p><p>FDA officials said they \u201ccannot take direct action\u201d with Negasmart and are relying on officials in Ecuador for the investigation into the company's actions. Negasmart does not ship product directly to the U.S. and of Negasmart's customers, only Austrofoods shipped foods to the U.S., the agency said.</p><p>At least 125 children from 22 states may have been sickened by lead poisoning since late October, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Using a different reporting method, the Food and Drug Administration counts at least 65 kids ages 6 and younger sickened in 27 states as of Dec. 8.</p><p>Tests show children who ate the pouches had blood lead readings up to eight times higher than the reference level that sparks concern, health officials said. Samples of the puree showed lead contamination more than 200 times higher than the FDA allows, officials said.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
