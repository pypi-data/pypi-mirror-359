    "description_summary": "Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin says it will resume offering abortions at its clinic in Sheboygan on Dec. 28. The group stopped offering abortions in June 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned its ruling in Roe v. Wade. Clinics in Madison and Milwaukee resumed providing abortions in September, after a judge said the state's 173-year-old abortion ban outlaws killing fetuses but does not prohibit consensual medical abortions. The same judge issued a final ruling earlier this month, and Planned Parenthood promised to resume abortions at the Sheboygan clinic as soon as possible. Conservatives have vowed to appeal the ruling.",
