    "description_summary": "Until recently, the Chinese manufacturer behind Elf Bar e-cigarettes was able to slip its products passed U.S. customs officials. That\u2019s according to public records reviewed by The Associated Press. The colorful vaping device has become the most popular disposable e-cigarette in the world. It has generated hundreds of millions in sales and quickly emerged as the top choice of underage U.S. teens who vape. But Elf Bar is not alone. Records show makers of rival disposable electronic cigarettes also routinely mislabel their shipments from China, thwarting efforts by U.S. officials to intercept products that have been declared illegal.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 In only two years, a small, colorful vaping device called <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ecigarettes-elf-bar-fda-disposable-vaping-5245aed253ca9cdcf119483bd9cee1f1\">Elf Bar</a> has become the most popular disposable e-cigarette in the world, generating billions in sales and quickly emerging as the overwhelming favorite of underage <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/teen-vaping-smoking-cdc-survey-d1f44bd3d8df6960215a14454f5e2e6e\">U.S. teens who vape</a>.</p><p>Last week, U.S. authorities publicly <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/joint-federal-operation-results-seizure-more-18-million-illegal-e-cigarettes\">announced</a> the first seizure of some of the company\u2019s products, part of an operation confiscating <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ecigarettes-elf-bar-fda-teen-vaping-434dc600866cf2a626aa8c7a0063ac43\">1.4 million illegal, flavored e-cigarettes from China</a>. Officials pegged the value of the items at $18 million, including brands other than Elf Bar.</p><p>But the makers of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fda-vapes-vaping-elf-bar-juul-80b2680a874d89b8d651c5e909e39e8f\">Elf Bar and other Chinese e-cigarettes</a> have imported products worth hundreds of millions of dollars while repeatedly dodging customs and avoiding taxes and import fees, according to public records and court documents reviewed by The Associated Press.</p><p>Records show the makers of disposable vapes routinely mislabel their shipments as \u201cbattery chargers,\u201d \u201cflashlights\u201d and other items, hampering efforts to block products that are driving teen vaping in the U.S.</p><p>\u201cThe steps toward regulating disposables have been very weak and that has enabled this problem to get bigger and bigger,\u201d said Eric Lindblom, a former Food and Drug Administration official.</p><p>Fruit-and-candy-flavored disposables began <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fda-vapes-vaping-elf-bar-juul-5e45cf57dc78f6b94213047c97b10f7e\">pouring into the U.S.</a> shortly before Chinese regulators banned vaping flavors last year. Officials there said they were acting to protect children\u2019s health, but vaping executives and health experts note the ban came only after e-cigarettes began threatening sales of traditional cigarettes, which generate $200 billion annually for China\u2019s state-run tobacco monopoly.</p><p>Disposable e-cigarettes may soon become the victim of their own success. From Australia to England, governments are moving toward banning the single-use products, citing underage use and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/vaping-ecigarettes-waste-environment-disposable-pollution-3d19dce9693ce78dd244729f524df02a\">environmental impact</a>.</p><p>The global backlash could lead vaping entrepreneurs to focus even more on the U.S., where loopholes and lax enforcement make it easy to disguise e-cigarettes among the thousands of daily shipments arriving by sea and air.</p><p>\u2018DISCREET\u2019 SHIPPING</p><p>Elf Bar is the lead product of Shenzhen iMiracle, a privately held company based in Shenzhen, the sprawling Chinese manufacturing hub that produces more than 95% of the world\u2019s e-cigarettes.</p><p>Elf Bar, Lost Mary and several other iMiracle brands are expected to generate $3.5 billion to $4 billion globally this year, according to industry analyst ECigIntelligence.</p><p>In the U.S., iMiracle recently abandoned the Elf Bar name due to a trademark dispute and efforts by regulators to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ecigarettes-elf-bar-vapes-4353becf747846b528ec2aea609ed2f9\">seize its imports</a>. Instead, its products are sold as EB Create in flavors like watermelon ice and frozen creamsicle.</p><p>A spokesman for iMiracle said the company stopped shipping Elf Bar to U.S. earlier this year and is trying to comply with regulators.</p><p>\u201cAll the Elf Bar-branded products you see in the U.S. are counterfeit, I\u2019m pretty sure about this,\u201d said Jacques Xiang Li, who added that he\u2019d only worked for iMiracle for three months and was still learning about its business.</p><p>When asked about EB Create e-cigarettes he said: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you anything about that.\u201d</p><p>Details on the company\u2019s U.S. sales and activities are beginning to emerge in court documents.</p><p>Earlier this year, iMiracle was forced to drop the Elf Bar name after losing a trademark case to a smaller company that already sold its own products as Elf vapes.</p><p>At a 2022 court hearing in the case, U.S. distributors described skyrocketing sales.</p><p>Jon Glauser, of Demand Vape in Buffalo, N.Y., told a federal judge his company had sold more than $132 million worth of Elf Bar products, accounting for a third of its yearly profits.</p><p>\u201cWe were selling it faster than we could get it in,\u201d Glauser said, according to the court transcript.</p><p>Glauser attributed Elf Bar\u2019s quick rise to its profit margin. Sellers make about a 30% profit, double that of other disposable e-cigarettes, he said.</p><p>IMiracle\u2019s parent company, Heaven Gifts, previously described how it could help customers evade import fees and taxes. Heaven Gifts\u2019 website advertised \u201cdiscreet\u201d shipping methods to buyers, including not mentioning e-cigarettes or its company name \u201canywhere on the package.\u201d Instead, the company said contents would be labeled as \u201catomizer, coil, tube, etc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe also mark a lower value to avoid tax,\u201d the website stated, adding that customers could suggest their own value for the shipment.</p><p>In June, Heaven Gifts <a href=\"https://www.heavengifts.com/index.html\">announced</a> it would \u201cgo offline,\u201d shortly after the FDA directed customs officials to begin seizing shipments from the company.</p><p>Despite the update, the company\u2019s spokesman indicated Heaven Gifts remains in business and staffers continue using email accounts bearing its name. The spokesman did not respond to numerous follow-up questions about the company's business.</p><p>Neither Heaven Gifts nor iMiracle appear in customs data reviewed by the AP and compiled by ImportGenius, a global trade analytics company.</p><p>The seizure announced last week suggests part of the answer: The shipments arrived at Los Angeles International Airport, and air carriers are not required to disclose the same details about their cargo as ocean vessels. The e-cigarettes were mislabeled as toys, shoes and other items.</p><p>Ships docking in the U.S., which account for most Chinese imports, must provide information on suppliers, recipients and types of cargo they are carrying. But importers can obscure their identities and products.</p><p>For example, U.S. recipient information is listed as \u201cnot available\u201d for roughly 45 of over 100 shipments of e-cigarettes from China this year, according ImportGenius data. U.S. companies can avoid disclosure by using third-party shippers, called freight forwarders, who handle foreign goods on behalf of importers.</p><p>\u201cAll of this suggests that these companies are incredibly sophisticated, they know how to game this system and they are intentionally doing so,\u201d said William George, research director for ImportGenius.</p><p>It\u2019s likely most disposable e-cigarettes coming into the U.S. aren\u2019t even declared as vaping products.</p><p>Esco Bars, one of Elf Bar\u2019s chief U.S. rivals, imported 30 shipments from China this year labeled \u201catomizers,\u201d a generic type of hardware that turns a liquid into a spray. The Texas-based company received the shipments, weighing about 25,000 pounds each, under its shipping arm, Affiliated Imports LLC. The shipments stopped in May, after the FDA placed Esco Bars on a list of banned imports.</p><p>Another disposable maker, Magellan Technology, routinely labeled its imports as \u201cbattery chargers,\u201d records show.</p><p>Neither company responded to AP\u2019s inquiries.</p><p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not make officials available for interviews, but pointed to the agency\u2019s recent operation in Los Angeles with the FDA.</p><p>\u201cThe rise in illicit e-commerce demands that our agencies remain vigilant in intercepting shipments that could pose serious health risks to the public,\u201d Troy Miller, a senior official with the border agency, said in a release.</p><p>FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said that agency is \u201ccommitted to continuing to stem the flow of illegal e-cigarettes into the United States.\u201d</p><p>U.S. tobacco companies say their e-cigarettes \u2014 which undergo FDA review and don\u2019t come in fruity flavors \u2014 can\u2019t compete with lower-priced disposables. In recent weeks both Reynolds American and Altria filed separate legal actions against iMiracle, Esco Bars and other disposable makers.</p><p>Documents filed by Reynolds with the U.S. International Trade Commission describe elaborate techniques for smuggling disposables into the country.</p><p>In a sworn affidavit, a former FDA investigator now working for Reynolds describes vape exhibitors at a recent conference removing hidden e-cigarettes from flashlights, \u201cwhich is consistent with the fraudulent practice of Chinese manufacturers declaring the product as flashlights.\"</p><p>Last week, the commission announced it would open an investigation into the matter.</p><p>\u2018NO FUTURE\u2019 FOR VAPING IN CHINA</p><p>The rise of disposable e-cigarettes in the U.S. can be traced to actions by Chinese regulators.</p><p>China\u2019s vaping sector is estimated to be worth $28 billion, and the U.S. accounts for nearly 60% of the country\u2019s vape exports, according to the China Electronics Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>Chinese authorities have encouraged those exports while at the same time drastically curtailing the country\u2019s domestic vaping business, which is controlled by several hundred private companies.</p><p>The government brought vaping companies under control of its state-run tobacco administration, beginning with a prohibition on online sales in 2019 and culminating in a sweeping ban on all flavors except tobacco.</p><p>The flavor ban sent domestic sales for large Chinese manufacturers like RLX Technology plummeting over 50%. Many vape shops and smaller producers also closed, unable to obtain government-issued licenses needed to operate.</p><p>Authorities cited concerns over \u201cunsafe additives, leaky e-juice and shoddy batteries.\u201d But experts who have spent years in the country point to another cause: vaping\u2019s encroachment on government tobacco sales.</p><p>The China National Tobacco Corp., the state-run monopoly, is the largest tobacco company in the world. In cooperation with its regulatory arm, the Tobacco Monopoly Administration, the pair controls the manufacture, marketing and pricing of all cigarettes made in China.</p><p>Between 2017 and 2020, e-cigarette sales increased more than 254%, according to data firm EuroMonitor. Those sales accrued exclusively to vaping entrepreneurs, not the government.</p><p>\u201cThe tobacco administration says, \u2018Well, every e-cigarette sold means one less cigarette smoked,\u2019 so they are going to regulate the hell out of them now,\u201d said Dr. Ray Yip, a public health consultant and former director of the Gates Foundation\u2019s China program.</p><p>Euromonitor expects e-cigarette sales of $822 million this year inside China, down more than 70% from a nearly $3 billion peak.</p><p>\u201cEveryone in the industry has suffered from the government\u2019s ban because people like flavored vapes,\u201d said Lin Jian, who owns a vape shop in Shenzhen. Jian said he can no longer afford to hire employees to help at the shop, which barely covers his expenses.</p><p>Hu Leng, manager of a contract vape manufacturer in Shenzhen said: \u201cThere is no future in the domestic market. All of our products are sold to Europe and we\u2019re doing well for the time being.\u201d</p><p>EXPLOITING LOOPHOLES</p><p>Elf Bar-maker Shenzhen iMiracle is among the companies that have built their entire business on exports.</p><p>In late 2021, the company began shipping to the U.S. to exploit a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-us-news-ap-top-news-tobacco-industry-regulation-weekend-reads-600c4aa443dde043aad6f70a00251fa0\">regulatory loophole</a>: The FDA had <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-marijuana-donald-trump-ap-top-news-tobacco-industry-regulation-d22aed5d39273150d640e02ef89823cd\">prohibited kid-appealing flavors</a> from reusable vapes, such as Juul, but not disposable ones.</p><p>An entrepreneur, Zhang Shengwei, founded Heaven Gifts in 2004 as an e-commerce platform for e-cigarettes. Over the years he invested in companies up and down the supply chain \u2014 makers of batteries, nicotine solutions and other components. Around 2018 the company began manufacturing its own vapes, according to iMiracle\u2019s spokesman. (Heaven Gifts and iMiracle share the same building address in Shenzhen.)</p><p>Shengwei\u2019s holdings now include more than a half-dozen companies, including a Hong Kong subsidiary, iMiracle HK Limited and VapeOnly Technology, which is listed as Elf Bar\u2019s manufacturer on some products. The company spokesman declined to make Shengwei available for an interview.</p><p>Vaping analysts are quick to separate companies like iMiracle from more established Chinese manufacturers like Smoore International, which have longstanding relationships with regulators and vaping brands around the world.</p><p>\u201cThis is much more of an opportunistic attempt to generate revenue quickly using the capacity that\u2019s there in Shenzhen,\u201d said Shane MacGuill, head of nicotine research for Euromonitor. \u201cI would guess that a long-term view is not part of the strategic play here.\u201d</p><p>A spokesperson for China\u2019s tobacco administration did not respond to repeated requests for comment, but the country\u2019s regulations state that exported vapes \u201cshould comply with the laws, regulations and standards of the destination country.\u201d Since the FDA has declared Elf Bar illegal, iMiracle would seem to be violating Chinese law by shipping to the U.S.</p><p>But experts say such rules go unenforced.</p><p>\u201cChina basically couldn\u2019t care what happens to the products if they\u2019re selling for export,\u201d said Patricia Kovacevic, an attorney specializing in tobacco regulation. \u201cIf it\u2019s something for export, you are not held to any standard.\u201d</p><p>GLOBAL BACKLASH</p><p>As brands like Elf Bar have traveled around the world, more governments are introducing measures to block their use, often citing the environmental toll of electronic waste.</p><p>Australia announced a ban on disposables over the summer. This month, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/france-smoking-single-use-ecigarettes-ban-18c36006172bc052844258d741f2694e\">French lawmakers</a> unanimously approved a bill to prohibit disposables.</p><p>Perhaps nowhere has the backlash been more drastic than in the U.K., where health authorities have long promoted vaping as a less harmful alternative for adult smokers.</p><p>In October, the country\u2019s conservative government called for legislation aimed at reducing underage vaping, including a potential ban on disposable products.</p><p>Vaping advocates say disposables have \u201cmassively\u201d damaged the industry\u2019s reputation.</p><p>\u201cSix months ago, I had a government that was very pro-vaping. Now I have a prime minister spending his time railing against vaping,\u201d said John Dunne, of U.K. Vaping Industry Association. \u201cThat to me is a tsunami of change and the only thing that\u2019s changed is disposables.\u201d</p><p>Dunne blamed some of the missteps on \u201cvery small, inexperienced teams of employees.\u201d He sees an improving picture, noting that iMiracle recently hired regulatory staffers to oversee compliance in Europe and the U.K. The company also recently said it would drop some of its dessert and soft drink-based flavors.</p><p>But even as iMiracle appears to be pulling back on disposables in the U.K., the company is already launching new products.</p><p>Last month, vape shops began promoting a new offering from iMiracle\u2019s U.K. subsidiary: <a href=\"https://www.elfbar.co.uk/nicotine-alternatives\">TACJA nicotine pouches</a>.</p><p>The pouches are similar to nicotine gum and less messy than traditional chewing tobacco. They come in colorful, plastic containers displaying their flavor, strength and the tagline: \u201cpowered by Elf Bar.\u201d</p><p>One Instagram post is typical of the new advertising pitch: \u201cEnjoy next level of satisfaction and unrivalled convenience, all with the same great Elf Bar taste you know and love.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.

It touches on health-related issues such as the popularity of these products among underage users, regulatory actions by the FDA, and the potential health risks posed by illicit e-cigarettes. However, the primary focus is on the business and regulatory side rather than health impacts alone. Therefore, while it is relevant to health, it is not the central theme."
