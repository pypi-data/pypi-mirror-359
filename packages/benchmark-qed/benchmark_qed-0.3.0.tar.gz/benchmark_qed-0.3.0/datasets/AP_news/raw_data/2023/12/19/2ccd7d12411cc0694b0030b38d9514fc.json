The Missouri Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled the law is unconstitutional because it covers multiple unrelated issues. The law also banned COVID-19 vaccine requirements for public workers. The judges' ruling means vaccine mandates for public workers now are allowed in Missouri. The decision also means unhoused people no longer face jail time and fines for sleeping on state property.",

Steven Roberts, proposed legislation that would have relaxed the homelessness provisions. On Tuesday, he said he was not yet aware of the court ruling striking down the law but likely will pull his proposal in response.</p><p>Missouri's next legislative session begins in January.</p>",
