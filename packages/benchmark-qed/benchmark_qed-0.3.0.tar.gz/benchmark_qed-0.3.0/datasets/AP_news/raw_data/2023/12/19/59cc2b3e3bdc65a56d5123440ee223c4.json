    "body_nitf": "<p>Indianapolis Business Journal. December 15, 2023.</p><p>Editorial: Legislature needs to lead to solve state\u2019s literacy crisis</p><p>The statistics are startling: Nearly one in five Hoosier students is still struggling to read by the end of third grade.</p><p>Indiana policymakers thought they had found a solution to the problem more than a decade ago when the State Board of Education created a rule requiring children who failed the IREAD-3 third-grade literacy test to be held back.</p><p>Exceptions were created for students who have disabilities, are English-language learners or receive special tutoring. But over the years, the exceptions seemed to widen as the number of students promoted on to third grade without the required reading skills increased dramatically.</p><p>Chalkbeat Indiana recently reported that about 96% of students who did not pass the IREAD-3 moved to fourth grade over the past decade.</p><p>In 2023, 13,840 third graders\u2014or 18% of all third graders in the state\u2014did not pass the test. Of those, 13,428 moved on to fourth grade, and only 412 stayed in third grade another year.</p><p>In addition, student performance on the IREAD-3 test has deteriorated significantly over the past 10 years. In 2012, 91.4% of third graders passed the test. Last year, that number stood at 81.9%.</p><p>Leaders in the Republican-dominated Indiana General Assembly appropriately have pronounced that attacking the third-grade literacy problem will be a priority when the Legislature convenes on Jan. 8.</p><p>Leaders of both the House and Senate have said the focus will be on tightening rules that keep students in the third grade if they fail the literacy exam, even though some educators question the effectiveness of retention.</p><p>But House Speaker Todd Huston, R-Fishers, also told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that the state\u2019s larger goal should be to ensure that students have the skills to learn to read by the time they have reached third grade.</p><p>The reality is that the literacy problem in Indiana elementary schools has reached a crisis, and the state needs to throw everything at it that it can.</p><p>The Legislature took an important first step last year, mandating curriculum and teacher training in the Science of Reading. The approach is based on scientifically based research that requires the systematic use of phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension.</p><p>We\u2019ll have to wait and see how effective that new approach will be, but that doesn\u2019t mean lawmakers should sit on their hands in the meantime or just toughen third-grade retention requirements.</p><p>This crisis requires an all-hands-on-deck approach that tries as many potential solutions as possible to see which one will move the needle.</p><p>The <a href=\"undefined\">Lilly Endowment</a> is doing its part. This week, it announced plans to provide $21.5 million in grants to help 28 Indiana colleges and universities instruct teachers in Science-of-Reading methods.</p><p>Ultimately, it will take the cooperation of business and government leaders, educators and philanthropists of all political stripes to solve the problem.</p><p>There is no time to waste. Literacy in the third grade must be improved so that all students have a chance to succeed in school and life and become productive members of society.</p><p>___</p><p>Fort Wayne Journal Gazette. December 13, 2023.</p><p>Editorial: Rural Hoosiers need quality health care</p><p>State officials have recognized Angola\u2019s Cameron Memorial Community Hospital and a physician with Parkview Health for their commitment to rural communities, which are suffering through a health care crisis.</p><p>Dr. Eric Reichenbach, a family medicine physician at the Parkview Wabash Health Clinic in North Manchester, won the Outstanding Rural Health Provider Award. Cameron Memorial won the Quality Improvement and Critical Access Hero awards. The two received the commendations through the Indiana Department of Health and State Office of Rural Health Critical Access Hospital Award program.</p><p>Unfortunately, such health oases are rare in rural America. Since 2015, nine rural Indiana hospitals have closed including four since 2022. IU Health Blackford is the latest to close its doors in October.</p><p>\u201cOne of the challenges for rural communities is the ability to recruit and retain health care providers, especially obstetricians,\u201d said Laura Kracher, vice president of public affairs and communication for the Indiana Hospital Association. \u201cIn Indiana, 87% of rural residents live in areas with a primary care shortage.\u201d</p><p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services lists Noble, DeKalb, Whitley, Huntington and Adams counties as health professional shortage areas.</p><p>In looking at data from the federal Rural Health Information Hub, the counties that collar Fort Wayne and Allen County have a shortage of physicians per 10,000 people. For example, Allen County has 28.7 physicians per 10,000 residents. Huntington is at 13.3, while Adams is at 5.3 doctors per 10,000. Both counties have about 36,000 residents, showing the disparity isn\u2019t about county size.</p><p>The numbers are even more stark when looking at the availability of nurse practitioners and physician\u2019s assistants in those counties. NPs and PAs are graduate-level trained and licensed professionals who can provide primary care.</p><p>According to National Rural Health Association data, 25% of Indiana\u2019s 55 rural hospitals have \u201cnegative operating margins,\u201d 13 have pulled back service and seven hospitals considered closing. The association did not mention facilities by name.</p><p>Meanwhile, the health disparities between rural and urban areas are pronounced and startling, with the people in the former being older and more prone to chronic conditions such as lower respiratory disease, heart disease, stroke and cancer. Rural men and women will live about three years fewer than their urban counterparts.</p><p>Cancer care, mental health and dialysis are the most difficult services to access for rural Hoosiers.</p><p>Indiana Hospital Association\u2019s Kracher points to low Medicaid reimbursement as a significant challenge for hospitals, particularly in rural areas where more than half of annual births are covered by Medicaid. In Indiana, hospitals are experiencing significant financial losses due to inflation and rising costs, she said.</p><p>Medicaid expansion \u2014 Indiana was the first red state to expand in 2015 \u2014 improved the financial performance of hospitals and other providers particularly for rural and small hospitals, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation survey of research released in June.</p><p>But the amount paid by Medicaid has not changed in 30 years to keep up with costs, Kracher said.</p><p>According to an outside analysis the Indiana Hospital Association commissioned surveying inpatient operating base rates, the standard amount of Medicaid reimbursement paid in Indiana is $3,524. Kentucky and Michigan, which have compiled complex methodologies that include legislatively approved base rate increases, paid average amounts of $5,796 and $4,996, respectively. Ohio\u2019s base rate is just over $5,000.</p><p>\u201cPolicy solutions are needed to raise Medicaid reimbursement for hospitals now so that we don\u2019t erode access to vital health care services or see our rural and urban safety hospitals close,\u201d Karcher said. \u201cPolicymakers in neighboring states like Kentucky and Illinois have successfully enacted policies to raise their reimbursement levels just in the last year. Without immediate financial support, Medicaid shortfalls will only exacerbate the emerging trends of service reductions and facility closures across the state.\u201d</p><p>Indiana can\u2019t hold itself as inclusive and equitable if we\u2019re telling 1 million rural Hoosiers that the choice for living in the country is to submit to a growing health care desert.</p><p>___</p><p>Jeffersonville News and Tribune. December 15, 2023.</p><p>Editorial: Money matters this session</p><p>It\u2019s not a budget year, but money should always be a priority for Indiana legislators.</p><p>From encouraging economic development to ensuring Hoosier workers are paid livable wages, lawmakers can play a pivotal role in moving Indiana forward financially.</p><p>RETOOL INDIANA\u2019S ECONOMY</p><p>Artificial Intelligence no longer belongs in a science fiction novel. AI is here and it\u2019s changing our world daily. It\u2019s incumbent upon our legislators to keep Indiana on the cutting edge of AI if the state is to excel in the new high-tech world.</p><p>Lawmakers should embrace the changes, support institutions that are training tomorrow\u2019s workforce to utilize AI and establish logical and ethical guidelines for the technology.</p><p>A 2021 study from Purdue University found that Indiana is lagging behind when it comes to AI advances and manufacturing. The state simply can\u2019t afford to fail on this issue.</p><p>BET ON GAMING</p><p>From tax revenue to foundations supporting surrounding communities, Indiana has benefited from casinos. But the state is behind the curve on electronic gaming.</p><p>Bills have been introduced during recent sessions to legalize video gaming terminals, but have failed to pass. Coming out of the pandemic, allowing bars and restaurants to have video gaming machines could generate needed revenue for those businesses.</p><p>Reimagining Indiana\u2019s electronic gaming laws would also cut down on corruption.</p><p>READI FOR MORE</p><p>The Regional Economic Acceleration and Development Initiative, or READI, has been a major success in Indiana. Millions of dollars are being spent on local quality of life, place and opportunity projects.</p><p>Lawmakers approved funding for a second round of READI last session. Those funds support the improvements that draw people to Indiana to work and play. It\u2019s not just about a job, but what workers can expect from a community that attracts them to a new destination.</p><p>Great parks, entertainment districts and infrastructure support the fabric of a community, and that\u2019s why programs like READI are so important to economic development and the overall financial well-being of a state.</p><p>Lawmakers should consider a plan for sustained funding of READI efforts.</p><p>INVEST IN TRAINING</p><p>Don\u2019t let low unemployment rates fool you \u2014 cutting back on workforce training programs is a bad idea.</p><p>The funding for some workforce development and training efforts is tied to unemployment. The lower the jobless rate, the lower the amount of funding from the state and federal sources.</p><p>The best way to keep workers employed is by having them equipped with skills that make them attractive to employers regardless of the condition of the economy. Waiting until jobless rates rise to provide more resources is like waiting until the flood arrives to build a levee.</p><p>DON\u2019T FORGET ABOUT WORKERS</p><p>Indiana has followed the federal lead, keeping minimum wage at $7.25 since 2009. A person making $7.25 hourly in 2024 won\u2019t be able to afford decent housing and will rely on public transportation and subsidies for food and clothing.</p><p>Why not go beyond the bare minimum and send a message that Indiana is a pro-worker state? At the least, legislators should welcome a robust, respectful discussion on raising the state\u2019s minimum wage.</p><p>Lawmakers should also hold companies that are receiving tax abatements to account on wages. Tax breaks shouldn\u2019t be handed out to businesses that aren\u2019t paying livable wages and offering employees the benefits they need and deserve.</p><p>END</p>",
