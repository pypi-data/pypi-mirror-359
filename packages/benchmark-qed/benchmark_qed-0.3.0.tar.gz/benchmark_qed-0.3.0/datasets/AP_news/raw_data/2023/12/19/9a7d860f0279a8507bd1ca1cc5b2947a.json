In a statement Monday, the 41-year-old Coleman said she expects to make a full recovery and thanked her family for its loving support. Coleman said she'll see Kentuckians again soon. Beshear said in a separate statement that Coleman is a friend and \u201ccritical part\u201d of his administration.",

Andy Beshear were <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kentucky-governor-andy-beshear-inauguration-d5c0ed8df6aefbb6b122b4f9727f5e4a\">sworn in for second terms</a>, having run successfully as a ticket again in the Bluegrass State.</p><p>In a statement Monday, Coleman thanked her family for its loving support and said she would see Kentuckians again soon.</p><p>The surgery followed a routine physical exam recently, she said.</p><p>\u201cWith a significant family history of cancer, I made the decision to have a double mastectomy,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cI am happy to report that a successful surgery was performed today, and I expect to make a full recovery.\u201d</p><p>Beshear said in a separate statement that Coleman is a friend and \u201ccritical part\u201d of his administration.</p><p>\u201cMy family and Kentucky families are standing with her during this time,\u201d the Democratic governor said.</p><p>Coleman, 41, was a fixture on the campaign trail throughout the hard-hitting campaign that featured Beshear and Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron at the top of the ticket. She debated her Republican rival for lieutenant governor in a televised debate late in the campaign. The Beshear-Coleman ticket won a convincing victory last month, even as every other statewide office was won by the GOP.</p><p>Coleman has already fielded questions about whether she will run for governor in 2027, politely brushing them aside. Beshear is term-limited from running for governor again in four years.</p><p>Coleman spent years as a teacher and school administrator before being tapped by Beshear as his running mate for their first successful run as a ticket in 2019. She's been an <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kentucky-lieutenant-governor-education-beshear-37bb98fda34a33b6c3ca02cf161232fe\">ardent proponent</a> of the governor's education proposals, including his push for higher teacher pay and universal access to pre-K for all 4-year-old Kentuckians. Besides her role as a public education advocate, Coleman focused on rural economic development, adult learning and student mental health initiatives during her first term.</p><p>She participated in daylong inaugural events last week. In her speech that day, Coleman touted the importance of the Beshear administration's education proposals, declaring: \u201cFrom cradle to career, education is the key that unlocks doors for every Kentuckian.\u201d Health care workers and educators served as grand marshals for the inaugural parade that day.</p><p>On Monday, Coleman was thanking her health-care providers for the care she's received.</p><p>\u201cAs Kentucky\u2019s highest elected teacher, it is only fitting that I leave you with a little homework: Schedule those preventative exams you\u2019ve put off, hug your people a little tighter and be kind, because everyone is fighting a battle you may know nothing about,\" she said.</p>",
