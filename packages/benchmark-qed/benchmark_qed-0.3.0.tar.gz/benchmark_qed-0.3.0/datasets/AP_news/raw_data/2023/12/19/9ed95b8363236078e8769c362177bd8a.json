The date would have been the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court case that legalized abortion nationwide. The court overturned the decision in 2022 in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. Harris said in a statement that she would \u201ccontinue to fight for our fundamental freedoms.\u201d Democrats successfully harnessed anger over the loss of abortion rights to stem their losses in the 2022 midterms, and they plan to make the issue a rallying cry in 2024 as well.",
