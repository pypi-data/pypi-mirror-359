    "description_summary": "Republican presidential hopeful Chris Christie is outlining his plan for addressing the latest wave of the nation's drug crisis. With 110,000 people dying of drug overdoses last year, Christie said, during a Wednesday trip to a New Hampshire recovery center, that reducing stigma and providing treatment is the only thing that\u2019s going to get the problem under control. Christie, who led a White House commission on opioid misuse in 2017, said both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden have treated the problem as a crisis in name only. And he says other Republican presidential candidates have focused too narrowly on preventing drugs from getting into the country.",

(AP) \u2014 Calling the latest wave of the nation\u2019s drug crisis \u201ca test of our national resolve,\u201d Republican presidential hopeful <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/chris-christie\">Chris Christie</a> returned to a New Hampshire recovery center Wednesday to outline a people-focused, not punitive, policy plan.</p><p>\u201cThis is a test to see who we want to be as both a people and as a country,\u201d he said at the Hope on Haven Hill wellness center, which services pregnant women and mothers struggling with substance use disorder. \u201cWe need an approach that remembers and reflects on the very basic humanity of every single one of those 100,000 victims, as well as the treasures each one of them could have brought to this country.\u201d</p><p>Christie led a White House commission on opioid misuse in 2017, and he praised <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump\">former president Donald Trump</a> for endorsing all 56 of its recommendations. But only about half have been enacted, and both Trump and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/joe-biden\">President Joe Biden</a> have treated the problem as a crisis in name only, Christie said. Meanwhile, other Republican presidential candidates, have focused too narrowly on preventing drugs from getting into the country, he said.</p><p>Without mentioning them by name, he described Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019s vow to shoot drug dealers at the border, former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley\u2019s plan to cut off trade with China and Trump\u2019s threat to take military action against Mexico.</p><p>\u201cIt will be important to stem some of the flow of this stuff into our country, but that\u2019s not going to be what fixes this problem by itself. And people who say that\u2019s what will do it just are not telling the truth,\u201d he said.</p><p>With 110,000 people dying of drug overdoses last year, reducing stigma and providing treatment is the only thing that\u2019s going to get the problem under control, he said.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t solve this crisis unless we focus on substance use disorder and what gets us there and what helps to help get people out of it and into recovery,\u201d he said.</p><p>Christie said he finds Biden\u2019s inaction particularly galling given Hunter Biden\u2019s struggles with addiction.</p><p>\u201cHe owes it to this country as a father who understands the pain that every family member goes through when there\u2019s someone with active addiction in their family,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s astonishing to me he\u2019s not talking about this.\u201d</p><p>Christie said he would increase access to medication-assisted treatment by making the telehealth policies created during the coronavirus pandemic permanent, requiring all federally qualified health centers to provide such treatment and creating mobile opioid treatment programs.</p><p>He also called for expanding block grants to states, tied to specific requirements for data collection and sharing. The pandemic, he argued, showed that vast amounts of data can be gathered and shared quickly, and the same should be done to track overdose deaths and identify the areas of greatest need.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been told for decades it\u2019s just too difficult to accurately track and understand,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we keep saying that these things are too hard, what we\u2019re saying is that working harder at this is too much and that the lives that we\u2019re losing are not worth it. I\u2019m sorry, I just don\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>Jackie Lacrosse, who lives in Hope on Haven Hill\u2019s transitional shelter with her three-year-old daughter, asked Christie what he would do to help those in recovery secure housing. She was pleased with his answer \u2014 reallocating money in federal programs to target that population \u2014 as well as his approach overall.</p><p>\u201cI think Chris is super knowledgeable, and I think he can bring that knowledge and his history to the campaign,\u201d she said.</p><p>Christie met the recovery center's founder during his 2016 campaign for president when she was just getting the program off the ground and has visited its facilities since. While the types of drugs have changed \u2014 from overprescribed painkillers to heroin to street-drugs laced with fentanyl \u2014 the stories he hears from voters have not, he said in an interview before his speech.</p><p>\u201cThe sad thing is, I see no difference eight years later, and I think that's the thing that is the most concerning and frustrating,\u201d he said.</p>",
