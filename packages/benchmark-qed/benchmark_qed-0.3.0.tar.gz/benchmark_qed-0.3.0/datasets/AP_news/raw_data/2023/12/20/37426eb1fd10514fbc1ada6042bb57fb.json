The events are observed with prayers, candles, moments of silence and the reading of names. They are typically held on Dec. 21, the first day of winter and the longest night of the year. Advocates hope to draw attention not only to the tragedy of the lives lost, but also the need for cities and counties to track such deaths.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 With his gap-tooth smile, hip-hop routines and volunteer work for a food charity, Roosevelt White III was well known in the downtown Phoenix tent city known as \u201cThe Zone.\u201d</p><p>But like many homeless people, White suffered from diabetes and cardiovascular disease. He died unexpectedly one sweltering September day at age 36.</p><p>Thousands of people like White who died this year without a permanent home are being memorialized on Thursday in communities from Cape Cod, Massachusetts to La Crosse, Wisconsin, to Riverside, California. Established in 1990, the increasingly popular Homeless Persons\u2019 Memorial Day is observed with prayers, candles, moments of silence and the reading of names on Dec. 21, the first day of winter and the longest night of the year.</p><p>A national gathering called \u201cOne Life, Too Many. Another Year, Too Long\u201d is planned Thursday afternoon in <a href=\"https://nhchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Memorial-Flyer-2023-Final-1.pdf\">Washington,</a> with a Zoom call so people can follow from afar.</p><p>Other gatherings will be in Cincinnati, Ohio; Wilmington, Delaware; and San Diego. A ceremony in Phoenix will honor 758 homeless people confirmed to have died so far this year in Maricopa County, the most populous in Arizona and home to Phoenix, the state's largest city.</p><p>That's already a record. The Maricopa County Medical Examiner investigated 732 deaths of homeless people in 2022, representing a 42% jump in deaths from 2021.</p><p>\"Without sufficient housing and services, people will continue to die on the streets,\u201d said Lisa Glow, CEO at Central Arizona Shelter Services, which operates the state\u2019s largest emergency shelter, a 600-bed facility in Phoenix.</p><p>DeBorah Gilbert White, the public education director for the National Coalition for the Homeless, said learning about those who died can shatter stereotypes. At one event several years ago, she learned of a 3-year-old homeless girl who died in the nation's capital.</p><p>White said that as the population grows older, more people are dying in their 60s. She noted that many with chronic conditions like diabetes don't have the necessary conditions, such as refrigeration for insulin, to care for their health.</p><p>Overall, homelessness is surging. The recent <a href=\"https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huduser.gov%2Fportal%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fpdf%2F2023-AHAR-Part-1.pdf&data=05%7C02%7CASnow%40ap.org%7C0f2112b7e3b14e56c27408dc016596c2%7Ce442e1abfd6b4ba3abf3b020eb50df37%7C1%7C0%7C638386784704447898%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C41000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Gjy8spLS7yfFTo%2FDMeZTRjz6AOySkrz%2BcQb4nobZVmY%3D&reserved=0\">Annual Homeless Assessment Report</a> from the Department of Housing and Urban Development showed that roughly 653,100 people in the United States were experiencing homelessness. That's a 12% overall increase over the previous year and the highest since reporting began in 2007.</p><p>\u201cA lot of people living in encampments are uninsured and without access to medical treatment for a variety of illnesses that are exacerbated by living unsheltered,\u201d said Etel Haxhiaj, a spokesperson for the <a href=\"https://nhchc.org/\">National Healthcare for the Homeless Council</a>.</p><p>The council supports the remembrance events to push for <a href=\"https://nhchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Homeless-Mortality-Toolkit-FULL-FINAL.pdf\">better tracking</a> of the deaths.</p><p>Maricopa County is among few U.S. jurisdictions engaged in such tracking.</p><p>Drug and alcohol abuse figured into many deaths and was often the main cause. While a stroke killed White, methamphetamine intoxication contributed to his death, according to the medical examiner. Cardiovascular events like strokes and heart attacks, followed by traffic injuries, are also common ways that homeless people die.</p><p>Many homeless people are estranged from family, which means their deaths can pass virtually unnoticed. But when White died, at least 60 people, including family members from Arizona and Oklahoma, showed up for his funeral. The food was catered by Feed Phoenix, the nonprofit organization he volunteered with.</p><p>Among the mourners was Phoenix documentary photographer Eric Elmore, who created numerous black and white portraits of White over a year. The downtown encampment where White lived once housed hundreds of people in tents, but it has since been cleared out under a court order.</p><p>\u201cHe had this kind of energy that would just draw you in,\u201d Elmore said of White. \u201cHe had a huge personality.\u201d</p><p>Megan Kepler, who volunteered with White, remembered him on Wednesday as \u201ca man who was full of kindness and joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlthough he had many struggles, he always had a smile on his face and a positive attitude. He stayed hopeful in the face of difficulties,\u201d said Kepler. \u201cWe miss our friend dearly, and hope that others can see that he was not just a number, but instead a valued and loved human being.\u201d</p>",
