Greeneville City Manager Todd Smith says the fire department was first called to La Quesera Mexicana, a local cheese factory, at 7:15 a.m. where a leak occurred during maintenance on a valve. Six people were hospitalized and the leak was believed fixed. However, a second call about a leak came at 10:01 a.m. and another 23 people were hospitalized. Smith says they aren't sure if the two leaks had the same source. He says the leak is now repaired and there is no threat to the surrounding community.",
