The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports that the state Department of Health led the investigation of Parham Doctors\u2019 Hospital, where Irvo Otieno was briefly held. The 28-year-old Black man died in March after being pressed to the floor of Central State Hospital for about 11 minutes by a group of Henrico County sheriff\u2019s deputies and hospital employees. Inspectors said that Parham staff were \u201cnot in compliance\u201d with health guidelines for hospitals that treat mental health crisis patients.",
