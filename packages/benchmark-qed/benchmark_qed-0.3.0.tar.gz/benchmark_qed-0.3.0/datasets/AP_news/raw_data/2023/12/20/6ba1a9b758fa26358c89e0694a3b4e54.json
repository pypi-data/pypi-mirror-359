Trumbull County Prosecutor Dennis Watkins said in a news release late Tuesday that prosecutors are \u201cduty bound\u201d to present the felony abuse-of-corpse charge against 33-year-old Brittany Watts, of Warren, to a grand jury. Watts was charged after she miscarried Sept. 22 and the 22-week-old fetus was found clogging her toilet. She pleaded not guilty. The hospital where she sought care before and after the miscarriage called police.",

Defendants are \u201cno-billed,\u201d or not indicted, in about 20% of the hundreds of cases county grand juries hear each year, he said.</p><p>\u201cThis office, as always, will present every case with fairness,\u201d Watkins wrote. \u201cOur responsibility carries with it specific obligations to see that the accused is accorded justice and his or her presumption of innocence and that guilt is decided upon the basis of sufficient evidence.\u201d</p><p>Watts miscarried at home on Sept. 22, days after a doctor told her that her fetus had a heartbeat but was nonviable. She twice visited Mercy Health-St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital in Warren and twice left before receiving care.</p><p>A nurse called police when Watts returned that Friday, bleeding, no longer pregnant and saying that her fetus was in a bucket in the backyard. Police arrived at her home, where they found the toilet clogged and the 22-week-old fetus wedged in the pipes. Authorities seized the toilet bowl and extracted the fetus.</p><p>Watts was ultimately charged with abuse of a corpse, a fifth-degree felony punishable by up to a year in jail and a $2,500 fine. The case touched off a national firestorm over the treatment of pregnant women, particularly those like Watts who are Black, in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0\">June 2022 decision</a> overturning federal abortion protections.</p><p>A city prosecutor told a municipal judge that Watts' actions broke the law. He said after she flushed, plunged and scooped out the toilet following her miscarriage, she left home knowing it was clogged and \u201cwent on (with) her day.\u201d</p><p>Watts has pleaded not guilty. Her attorney argued in court that she was being \u201cdemonized for something that goes on every day.\u201d An autopsy found \u201cno recent injuries\u201d to the fetus, which had died in utero.</p><p>On Friday, Ohio Physicians for Reproductive Rights \u2014 a coalition behind Ohio\u2019s newly passed reproductive rights amendment \u2014 wrote to Watkins, urging him to drop the charge against Watts. The group said the charge violates the \u201cspirit and letter\u201d of the amendment.</p>",

While the case touches on issues related to reproductive rights and the treatment of pregnant women, the primary focus is on the legal proceedings and the actions of the prosecutor.
