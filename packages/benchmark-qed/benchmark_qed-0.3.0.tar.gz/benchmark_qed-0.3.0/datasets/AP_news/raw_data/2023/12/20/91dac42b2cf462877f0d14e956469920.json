While the primary focus is on the accident and the response to it, there are elements related to health, such as the hospitalization of the workers and the monitoring of air quality by federal and state officials. However, the document does not delve deeply into health issues or provide extensive information on health impacts, making it somewhat relevant but not highly so."
