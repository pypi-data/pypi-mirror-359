Word of the shortfall came Tuesday in a report presented to the Indiana state budget committee. Agency officials say unexpected demand of services in some categories including elderly care caused the forecasting error. The state has directed $271 million from its surplus to pay for expenses from this year. But lawmakers will need to address the nearly $713 million more needed through fiscal year 2025.",

The state has directed that $271 million of that money be moved back to Medicaid to address the shortfall of the last year, he said.</p><p>According to the predictions presented to lawmakers on Tuesday, the state will need to appropriate $255.2 million more for the program before July 2024 and $457.9 million more for the following year.</p><p>The flawed April forecast was based on data that did not reflect the latest needs of enrollees, state agencies said. Jackson said demand for certain categories, such as elderly care, outpaced what state official anticipated. According to the report, home and community based long-term services and support are anticipated to be in need of the most funding over the next two years.</p><p>Medicaid director Cora Steinmetz told lawmakers Tuesday that the agency is working on proposals for controlling costs, prompting concern over <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/indiana-autism-therapy-medicaid-ff55b0c7146dd389a76317526498f266\">access to the the program</a>.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re exploring all aspects of the Medicaid program to look at where there might be an opportunity to generate potential savings on the appropriation,\u201d Steinmetz said.</p><p>Indiana's lawmakers finalize the state budget during odd-numbered years, leaving lawmakers and state agencies with a limited a path to enact legislative change in the upcoming 2024 session. Steinmetz said the agency will draft proposals for cost containment within the power of the agency and the budget committee.</p><p>States across the country are <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/medicaid-eligibility-states-coronavirus-pandemic-46484af651466539d6874c1a97397b50\">unwinding pandemic-era protections</a> that kept millions of people covered by Medicaid. <a href=\"https://www.in.gov/medicaid/members/member-resources/How-a-return-to-normal-will-impact-some-Indiana-Medicaid-members/medicaid-enrollment-dashboard/\">In Indiana</a>, the number of people enrolled in Medicaid steadily grew every month from March 2020 until May of this year, when the federal budget law ended the protections.</p><p>Indiana\u2019s total enrollment has fallen every month since then. Even so, the demand is still greater than before the pandemic.</p><p>According to the report, Indiana saw a net growth of over 370,000 Medicaid enrollees since January 2020.</p>",
