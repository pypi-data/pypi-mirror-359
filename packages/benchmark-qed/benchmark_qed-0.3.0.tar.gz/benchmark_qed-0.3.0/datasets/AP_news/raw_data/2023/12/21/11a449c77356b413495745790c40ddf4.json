The U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in St. Louis on Thursday announced the settlement with Total Access Urgent Care, which operates more than two dozen clinics in the St. Louis area. Federal prosecutors say Total Access Urgent Care submitted false insurance claims for COVID-19 testing between April 2021 and December 2021, using improper billing codes that resulted in the company getting reimbursements at a higher rate. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch says the company's statement says it \u201ccooperated fully\u201d with the investigation.",
