    "description_summary": "Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos says Republicans plan to unveil a proposal soon to legalize medical marijuana in the state and could vote on it sometime in 2024. Republicans have been working behind closed doors for years on a medical marijuana bill. Along the way, they have rejected calls from Gov. Tony Evers and other Democrats to legalize all uses of marijuana, including medical and recreational. Vos said in a Wednesday interview that the proposal will be limited and modeled after the medical marijuana law that had been in place in neighboring Minnesota before it moved to full legalization. The bill would have to pass the Senate and Assembly and be signed by Evers before taking effect.",

(AP) \u2014 Wisconsin Republicans plan to unveil a proposal soon to legalize medical marijuana in the state and could vote on it sometime in 2024, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said.</p><p>Republicans have been <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-medical-marijuana-legalization-republicans-92a5764d72a54914ecee54b37d6e8d5b\">working behind closed doors</a> for years on a medical marijuana bill. Along the way, they have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-budget-evers-republicans-marijuana-brewers-074c187f3dcf74b5fad99e2f65dde10a\">rejected calls</a> from Gov. Tony Evers and other Democrats to legalize all uses of marijuana, including medical and recreational.</p><p>Vos, in an interview Wednesday, said the proposal will be limited and modeled after the medical marijuana law that had been in place in neighboring Minnesota before it <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/minnesota-marijuana-legalization-recreational-midwest-1f01d19ad33f59dbc529d6811f831bb4\">moved to full legalization</a>.</p><p>\u201cIt is not going to be widespread,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not going to have dispensaries on every corner in every city.\u201d</p><p>He said Assembly Republicans are on board in concept, but no one has seen the actual proposal yet. He expected to unveil it in January. Vos had said in April that he hoped to have the bill by the fall of 2023, but he said it took more time to find consensus.</p><p>\u201cIn concept most people are there, but I don\u2019t want to guarantee anything until we have a wider discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel pretty good that we\u2019re in a place where I think it can get through our chamber.\"</p><p>Democratic state Sen. Melissa Agard, who has advocated for full marijuana legalization, said Thursday that she could support a more limited medical marijuana program, but \u201cI remain skeptical as to whether or not this is it.\u201d Agard, who has traveled the state calling for legalization, said she has offered to work with Republicans on the bill but has been rejected.</p><p>Democratic Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer said Democrats were open to discussing the Republican bill.</p><p>\u201cWe hope that it\u2019s a serious proposal from our colleagues that addresses the past harms that have been caused by the criminalization of marijuana and that really allows access for the people who need it,\u201d she said Thursday.</p><p>If passed by both the Senate and Assembly, it would have to be signed by Evers before taking effect. His spokesperson did not return a message Thursday seeking comment.</p><p>Senate Republicans have been less open to pot legalization than those in the Assembly. But in January, Senate Majority Leader <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/politics-wisconsin-83253c409ff4577123a327d6b65cb5d1\">Devin LeMahieu said</a> a bill to create a medical marijuana program could pass this legislative session \u2014 as long as regulations are put forward to ensure it\u2019s for those in serious pain.</p><p>Vos has long backed some form of medical marijuana program, but no bill has ever received a vote in either the GOP-controlled Assembly or Senate.</p><p>Wisconsin remains an outlier nationally, with 38 states legalizing medical marijuana and 24 legalizing recreational marijuana. The push for legalization in Wisconsin has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-health-wisconsin-marijuana-legalization-3d1920c4696b5f88a1aaa2ad2e30d924\">gained momentum</a>, as its neighbors have loosened laws.</p><p>Marquette University Law School polls have shown large majority support among Wisconsin residents for legalizing marijuana use for years. Given that broad, bipartisan support, there should be full legalization, Agard said.</p>",
