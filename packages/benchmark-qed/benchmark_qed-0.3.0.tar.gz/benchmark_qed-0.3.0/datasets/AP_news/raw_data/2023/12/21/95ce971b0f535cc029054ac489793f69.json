The cat was transferred to specialists in Iowa who amputated her left hind leg. She was soon after adopted by a woman who lost her left leg after a near-fatal car accident. Now the duo has partnered with a nonprofit that registers therapy animal volunteer teams. They visit hospitals, nursing homes and even amputee support groups to aid in therapy and other activities to improve well-being in communities. The duo is one of only an estimated 200 therapy cat teams in the United States.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>TROY, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Each morning when she wakes up, Juanita Mengel removes the silicone liner of her prosthetic leg out from under a heated blanket so that the metal parts of the artificial limb don't feel as cold on her skin when she straps the pieces together.</p><p>The 67-year-old Amanda, Ohio, resident then does the same for her 5-year-old dilute tortoiseshell cat, Lola-Pearl, who is missing her left hind leg.</p><p>The duo is one of an estimated 200 therapy cat teams registered in the U.S. through Pet Partners. The nonprofit sets up owners and their pets as volunteer teams providing animal-assisted interventions, where they might visit hospitals, nursing homes or schools to aid in therapy and other activities to improve well-being in communities.</p><p>\u201cA therapy animal is an animal who\u2019s been assessed based on their ability to meet new people and not just tolerate the interaction, but actively enjoy it,\u201d said Taylor Chastain Griffin, the national director of animal-assisted interventions advancement at the organization.</p><p>Pet Partners registers nine different species as therapy animals: dogs, cats, horses, rabbits, guinea pigs, rats, birds, mini pigs, and llamas and alpacas.</p><p>As part of her research, Chastain Griffin studies the impact of therapy cats and argues more research needs to be done. There\u2019s abundant research on other therapy animals like dogs, she said, but there\u2019s often a \u201cshock factor\u201d involved with therapy cats because many don\u2019t know they exist.</p><p>\u201cThey go into a setting and people are like, \u2018Whoa, there\u2019s a cat on a leash. What\u2019s happening?\u2019\u201d Chastain Griffin said. \u201cIt kind of inspires people to connect in a way we haven\u2019t traditionally heard talked about in other therapy animal interventions.\u201d</p><p>Mengel said she knew Lola-Pearl would be a good therapy cat after she brought her on a whim to an amputee coalition conference about a month after she adopted the domestic shorthair.</p><p>\u201cShe was so good with people I just knew she would be a good therapy cat,\" Mengel said. \u201cPeople really were attracted to her, too.\u201d</p><p>During a recent visit to a limb loss support group meeting, Mengel pushed Lola-Pearl around in a stroller \u2014 labeled \u201cTherapy Cat\u201d \u2014 so attendees could pet the kitty as she woke up from a nap.</p><p>Whether she was sitting in the stroller, walking in between participants' legs or cuddling on their laps, Lola-Pearl brought a smile to whoever she decided was worthy of her attention in that moment.</p><p>\u201cShe's very intuitive of people,\u201d Mengel said.</p><p>Lola-Pearl isn't the only cat in Mengel's life; the former traveling nurse who lost her left leg in 2006 after years of surgeries following a near-fatal car accident is a mother to seven felines, most of which have disabilities.</p><p>\u201cThey find you, you don't find them,\u201d she said.</p><p>Lola-Pearl was found at only a few weeks old with her back legs completely twisted together. She was unable to walk and brought to a friend of Mengel's at an animal shelter in Missouri, where veterinarians could not help her. The shelter found specialists in Iowa who were able to splint Lola-Pearl's legs as an attempt to save them, but they decided her left hind leg needed to be amputated.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mengel had been in talks with her friend in Missouri about adopting the cat, and after Lola-Pearl healed from surgery, Mengel officially adopted her.</p><p>Despite the obstacles Mengel has been through, she exudes a spirit of gratitude for Lola-Pearl and for the work they do together.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really rewarding experience,\u201d she said, \"I get just as much out of it as the people that I visit.\u201d</p>",
