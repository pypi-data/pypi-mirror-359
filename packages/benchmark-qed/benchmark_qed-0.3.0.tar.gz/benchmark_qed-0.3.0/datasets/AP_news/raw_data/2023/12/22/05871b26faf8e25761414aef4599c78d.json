Gerresheimer AG, based in Dusseldorf, said Thursday that it would build a new factory in Peachtree City. The company currently employs more than 260 people at the location south of Atlanta. It earlier announced an expansion that is supposed to add 180 jobs by April. The new factory, scheduled to open in fall 2024, will focus on making autoinjectors. Those spring-loaded syringes are used to inject drugs. An official says the new jobs will pay an average salary of $56,000 a year.",
