Ron DeSantis spread false information about doctors mutilating children\u2019s genitals. Judge Robert Hinkle said during the last day of the trial that DeSantis repeated his comments even though there\u2019s been no such documented cases of doctors castrating or mutilating children's genitals. Hinkle said he will rule sometime after the holidays on whether DeSantis, the Legislature and the Department of Health deliberately targeted transgender people with the new law or whether the law simply imposed reasonable restrictions to protect the public.",

(AP) \u2014 A federal judge hearing a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/florida-transgender-children-health-ban-desantis-7bc796924c49062b421b39241f7e751a\">challenge to a transgender health care ban for minors</a> and restrictions for adults noted Thursday that Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis repeatedly spread false information about doctors mutilating children's genitals even though there's been no such documented cases.</p><p>The law was sold as defending children from mutilation when it is actually about preventing trans children from getting health care, Judge Robert Hinkle said to Mohammad Jazil, a lawyer for the state.</p><p>\u201cWhen I'm analyzing the governor's motivation, what should I make of these statements?\u201d Hinkle asked. \u201cThis seems to be more than just hyperbole.\u201d</p><p>Hinkle said he will rule sometime in the new year on whether the Legislature, the Department of Health and presidential candidate DeSantis deliberately targeted transgender people through the new law. He raised some skepticism about the state\u2019s motivation as lawyers gave their closing arguments.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/desantis-florida-transgender-health-1631a752f805d163c5bdf9f2fd2ba337\">The trial is challenging Florida\u2019s ban</a> on medical treatment for transgender children, such as hormone therapy or puberty blockers, a law DeSantis touted while seeking the presidency. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/florida-transgender-health-care-adults-e7ae55eec634923e6593a4c0685969b2\">The law also places restrictions on adult trans care.</a></p><p>Jazil said the motivation behind the law was simply public safety in an area that needs more oversight and can have permanent consequences.</p><p>\u201cIt's about treating a medical condition; it's not about targeting transgender individuals,\u201d Jazil said.</p><p>Jazil added that if the state was targeting transgender people, it could have banned all treatment for adults and children. Hinkle quickly replied that Jazil would have trouble defending such a law.</p><p>Hinkle, who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton, has temporarily <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-health-desantis-florida-033556c6a4c301d9ad342c74a6410800\">blocked enforcement of the law</a> as it pertains to minors, pending the outcome of the trial. The lawsuit also challenges restrictions placed on adult trans care, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/florida-transgender-lgbtq-desantis-459f6664ee6b18780541b6f1aefed260\">which have been allowed to take effect during the trial.</a></p><p>At least 22 states have now enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, and many of those states face lawsuits. Courts have issued mixed rulings, with the nation\u2019s first law, in Arkansas, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/us-news/arkansas-gender-general-news-2a0d032f4e4f3195c180d879239e6521\">struck down by a federal judge</a> who said the ban on care violated the due process rights of transgender youth and their families.</p><p>Enforcement is blocked in two states besides Florida, and enforcement is currently allowed in or set to go into effect soon in seven other states.</p><p>Thomas Redburn, a lawyer representing trans adults and the families of trans children, said DeSantis and the Legislature have shown a pattern of targeting transgender people. He listed other recent laws that affect the community, including restrictions on pronoun use in schools, the teaching of gender identification in schools, restrictions on public bathrooms and the prohibition of trans girls from playing girls sports.</p>",

While the primary focus is on the legal and political aspects, the core issue is health care for transgender individuals, making it relevant to the topic of health."
