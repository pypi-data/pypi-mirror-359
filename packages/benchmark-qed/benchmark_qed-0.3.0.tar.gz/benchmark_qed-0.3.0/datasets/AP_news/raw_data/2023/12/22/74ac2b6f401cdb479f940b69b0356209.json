    "description_summary": "Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine has created a massive need for prosthetic limbs. An estimated 20,000 Ukrainians had amputations since the war started in February 2022, many of them soldiers who lost arms or legs due to blast wounds. Only a small number of them has been able to receive bionic prostheses, which are more advanced and can provide greater mobility than the traditional prosthetic limbs. Alexis Cholas lost his right arm as a volunteer combat medic near the front lines in eastern Ukraine. That ended his career as a surgeon. But thanks to a new bionic arm, he's now able to work as a rehab specialist, helping other amputees.",

But thanks to a new bionic arm, he was able to continue working in health care and is now a rehab specialist helping other amputees.</p><p>The 26-year-old is delighted with his sleek black robotic arm \u2014 he described it as \u201clove at first sight\u201d \u2014 and realizes how lucky he was to get one.</p><p>\u201cThere are fewer (bionic) arms available than lost ones,\u201d Cholas said.</p><p>Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine has created a massive need for prosthetic limbs. An estimated <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-amputees-wounded-soldiers-e2c5c47ea4b8326d980e630d3df87b77\">20,000 Ukrainians have had amputations</a> since the war started in February 2022, many of them soldiers who lost arms or legs due to blast wounds.</p><p>Only a small number was able to receive bionic prostheses, which are more advanced and can provide greater mobility than the traditional prosthetic limbs.</p><p>They are also far more costly than conventional prostheses.</p><p>Bionic artificial limbs typically pick up electrical signals from the muscles that remain above the amputation site, thanks to something called myoelectric technology, to carry out an intended motion.</p><p>Cholas' bionic arm was made by Esper Bionics. Before 2022, the Ukrainian startup primarily targeted the United States market, but due to the sharp rise in demand for prosthetic limbs caused by the war, Esper now distributes 70% of its products at home.</p><p>The company\u2019s production hub in the capital of Kyiv is working at full capacity, with more than 30 workers producing about dozen bionic hands a month.</p><p>In one corner of the factory, a small group of engineers huddle as they program, assemble and test the elegant bionic arms \u2014 known as Esper Hand. Each finger\u2019s movement on the robotic hand is accompanied by a soft whirring sound, assuring the engineers of its smooth operation.</p><p>Bohdan Diorditsa, head of strategic relations at the company, says that despite ramping up production, Esper Bionics is struggling to keep up with demand, with almost 120 people on the waitlist.</p><p>In Ukraine, the company says it provides the bionic prostheses at zero profit for about $7,000 a piece, just enough to cover production costs. In the United States, the Esper Hand sells for more than $20,000.</p><p>\u201cWe do not consider Ukraine as a market, but rather as an opportunity to help,\u201d says Diorditsa.</p><p>Compared to a conventional prosthesis, which is designed to replicate simple basic functions of a missing arm or leg, a bionic one offers the capability to restore fine motor skills.</p><p>\u201cEveryone wants them,\u201d says Anton Haidash, a prosthetist at Unbroken, a municipal center in the city of Lviv that focuses on rehabilitation of civilians and soldiers affected by the war. The center has helped provide prosthetic limbs to about 250 people so far, including about 20 bionic arms.</p><p>The difference in cost is significant. While bionic limbs can cost up to $50,000, conventional artificial limbs are priced at $800-$2,700, Haidash says.</p><p>Ukrainians can get the regular artificial limbs free of charge through the public health care system. However, to get a bionic prosthesis, they normally need additional funding from charities or rehabilitation centers such as Unbroken, which depend on donations.</p><p>And while patients can make the final decision about the type of prostheses they want, a variety of factors, including the nature of the injury and the person\u2019s occupation, also play a role.</p><p>Unbroken purchases bionic prostheses from German and Icelandic companies as well as Esper Bionics, whose notable advantage is having both a manufacturing and a service center in Ukraine. This means people don\u2019t need to travel abroad when a repair or resizing is required.</p><p>Another outstanding characteristic of the Esper Hand, which is powered by artificial intelligence, is its ability to adapt over time, learning the user's unique interactions with the hand.</p><p>After getting outfitted with his bionic arm, Cholas went back to volunteering as a combat medic on the front lines, while in his day job in Kyiv he works as a rehabilitation specialist in a public hospital. Most of his patients are members of the military or civilians who, like him, have lost limbs. He says their shared experience helps him quickly develop a rapport with his patients.</p><p>\u201cI now know a lot not only from textbooks but also from my own experience,\u201d he says.</p><p>Cholas speaks to his patients encouragingly as he examines their injuries. His movements with the bionic hand are natural and fluid. He effortlessly removes a bandage and dresses a patient\u2019s wounds without the assistance of nurses.</p><p>The bionic prosthesis allows him to perform even delicate movements, such as picking up a grape without crushing it, he says.</p><p>\u201cI feel uncomfortable when I\u2019m without the prosthesis,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when I have the bionic arm on, I feel comfortable. It\u2019s like a part of you.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press photographer Evegeniy Maloletka in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>Find more of AP\u2019s war coverage at <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\">https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</a></p>",
