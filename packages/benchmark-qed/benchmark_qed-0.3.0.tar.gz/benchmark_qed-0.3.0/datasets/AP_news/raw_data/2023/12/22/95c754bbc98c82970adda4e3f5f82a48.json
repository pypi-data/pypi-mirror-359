The World Health Organization said Friday that reported cases soared to a record 5.2 million in 2019, up from 500,000 in 2000, across 129 countries worldwide, figures that likely understate the actual toll. The agency says climate change and the growing spread of virus-carrying mosquitoes were partly to blame for the transmission that remains mostly prevalent in the Americas. In January, WHO warned that dengue posed a pandemic threat and was the world\u2019s fastest spreading mosquito-borne disease. It says more than 5 million cases and over 5,000 dengue-related deaths have been reported this year.",

While there are vaccines and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/dengue-mosquitoes-infectious-diseases-honduras-9ecf4ebc8a67937e9db7feb0901c861e\">specially bred mosquitoes containing a bacteria called Wolbachia</a> to fight dengue, there are no specific treatments for the virus once someone becomes infected.</p><p>This year, more than 5 million cases and over 5,000 dengue-related deaths were reported, WHO said. Changing distribution patterns of the mosquitoes that spread dengue, together with higher rainfall, humidity and heat linked to climate change, have been factors in the rise.</p><p>Weaker health systems and poor surveillance have also played a part.</p><p>Most cases of dengue don\u2019t cause symptoms or cause mild illness, though some infections can result in shock, severe bleeding and organ impairment \u2013 symptoms that typically emerge after fever has faded, WHO said.</p><p>Warning signs include intense abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bleeding gums, fluid accumulation, lethargy or restlessness, and liver enlargement, the agency said.
