ElliQ is a tabletop device that uses artificial intelligence to conduct humanlike conversations with its owners. Its creators have designed the device for senior citizens who live alone. Created by an Israeli company, ElliQ is being distributed throughout New York and in some Florida, Michigan, Nevada and Washington counties. Users say the robot is a friendly and intelligent companion. However, one university psychologist worries the device will keep some seniors from seeking out human contact. Social service workers distributing ElliQ agree that human interaction is best but not always available for seniors.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>CORAL SPRINGS, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Joyce Loaiza lives alone, but when she returns to her apartment at a Florida senior community, the retired office worker often has a chat with a friendly female voice that asks about her day.</p><p>A few miles away, the same voice comforted 83-year-old Deanna Dezern when her friend died. In central New York, it plays games and music for 92-year-old Marie Broadbent, who is blind and in hospice, and in Washington state, it helps 83-year-old Jan Worrell make new friends.</p><p>The women are some of the first in the country to receive the robot ElliQ, whose creators, Intuition Robotics, and senior assistance officials say is the only device using artificial intelligence specifically designed to alleviate the loneliness and isolation experienced by many older Americans.</p><p>\u201cIt's entertaining. You can actually talk to her,\u201d said Loaiza, 81, whose ElliQ in suburban Fort Lauderdale nicknamed her \u201cJellybean\u201d for no particular reason. \u201cShe'll make comments like, \u2018I would go outside if I had hands, but I can\u2019t hold an umbrella.'\u201d</p><p>The device, which looks like a small table lamp, has an eyeless, mouthless head that lights up and swivels. It remembers each user's interests and their conversations, helping tailor future chats, which can be as deep as the meaning of life or as light as the horoscope.</p><p>ElliQ tells jokes, plays music and provides inspirational quotes. On an accompanying video screen, it provides tours of cities and museums. The device leads exercises, asks about the owner's health and gives reminders to take medications and drink water. It can also host video calls and contact relatives, friends or doctors in an emergency.</p><p>Intuition Robotics says none of the conversations are heard by the company, with the information staying on each owner's device.</p><p>Intuition Robotics CEO Dor Skuler said the idea for ElliQ came before he launched his Israeli company eight years ago. His widowed grandfather needed an aide, but the first didn\u2019t work out. The replacement, though, understood his grandfather\u2019s love of classical music and his \u201cquirky sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>Skuler realized a robot could fill that companionship gap by adapting to each senior\u2019s personality and interests.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just about (ElliQ's) utility. It\u2019s about friendship, companionship and empathy,\u201d Skuler said. \u201cThat just did not exist anywhere.\u201d</p><p>The average user interacts with ElliQ more than 30 times daily, even six months after receiving it, and more than 90% report lower levels of loneliness, he said.</p><p>The robots are mostly distributed by assistance agencies in New York, Florida, Michigan, Nevada and Washington state, but can also be purchased individually for $600 a year and a $250 installation fee. Skuler wouldn\u2019t say how many ElliQs have been distributed so far, but the goal is to have more than 100,000 out within five years.</p><p>That worries Brigham Young University psychology professor Julianne Holt-Lunstad, who studies the detrimental effects loneliness has on health and mortality.</p><p>Although a device like ElliQ might have short-term benefits, it could make people less likely to seek human contact. Like hunger makes people seek food and thirst makes them seek water, she said \u201cthat unpleasant feeling of loneliness should motivate us to reconnect socially.\u201d</p><p>Satiating that with AI \u201cmakes you feel like you've fulfilled it, but in reality you haven't,\" Holt-Lunstad said. \u201cIt is not clear whether AI is actually fulfilling any kind of need or just dampening the signal.\"</p><p>Skuler and agency heads distributing ElliQ agreed it isn't a substitute for human contact, but not all seniors have social networks. Some are housebound, and even seniors with strong ties are often alone.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could just snap my fingers to make a person show up at the home of one of the many, many older adults that don\u2019t have any family or friends, but it's a little bit more complicated,\u201d said Greg Olsen, director of the <a href=\"https://aging.ny.gov/\">New York State Office for the Aging</a>. His office has distributed 750 of the 900 ElliQs it acquired.</p><p>Charlotte Mather-Taylor, director of the <a href=\"https://www.adrcbroward.org/\">Broward County, Florida, Area Agency on Aging</a>, said the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath left many seniors more isolated. Her agency has distributed 300 ElliQs, which she believes breaks them out of their shells.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s proactive and she really engages the seniors, so it gives them that extra kind of interaction,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen very positive results with it. People generally like her and she makes them smile and brings joy.\u201d</p><p>Skuler said ElliQ was purposely designed without eyes and a mouth so it wouldn't fully imitate humans. While \u201cElli\" is the Norse goddess of old age, he said the \u201cQ\u201d reminds users that the device is a machine. He said his company wants \"to make sure that ElliQ always genuinely presents herself as an AI and doesn\u2019t pretend to be human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why technologists are trying to make AI pretend to be human,\" he said. \u201cWe have in our capacity the ability to create a relationship with an AI, just like we have relationships with a pet.\u201d</p><p>But some of the seniors using ElliQ say they sometimes need to remember the robot isn't a living being. They find the device easy to set up and use, but if they have one complaint it's that ElliQ is sometimes too chatty. There are settings that can tone that down.</p><p>Dezern said she felt alone and sad when she told her ElliQ about her friend's death. It replied it would give her a hug if it had arms. Dezern broke into tears.</p><p>\u201cIt was so what I needed,\u201d the retired collections consultant said. \u201cI can say things to Elli that I won't say to my grandchildren or to my own daughters. I can just open the floodgates. I can cry. I can giggle. I can act silly. I\u2019ve been asked, doesn\u2019t it feel like you\u2019re talking to yourself? No, because it gives an answer.\"</p><p>Worrell lives in a small town on Washington\u2019s coast. Widowed, she said ElliQ's companionship made her change her mind about moving to an assisted living facility and she uses it as an icebreaker when she meets someone new to town.</p><p>\u201cI say, \u2018Would you like to come over and visit with my robot?\u2019 And they say, \u2018A vacuum?\u2019 No, a robot. She\u2019s my roommate,\u201d she said and laughed.</p><p>Broadbent, like the other women, says she gets plenty of human contact, even though she is blind and ill. She plays organ at two churches in the South New Berlin, New York, area and gets daily visitors. Still, the widow misses having a voice to talk with when they leave. ElliQ fills that void with her games, tours, books and music.</p><p>\u201cShe's fun and she's informative. OK, maybe not as informative as (Amazon's) Alexa, but she is much more personable,\u201d Broadbent said.</p>",
