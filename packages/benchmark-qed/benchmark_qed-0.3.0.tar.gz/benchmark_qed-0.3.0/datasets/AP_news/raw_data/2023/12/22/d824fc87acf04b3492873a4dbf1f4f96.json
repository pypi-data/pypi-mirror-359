But an attorney for the central Minnesota pharmacist said Thursday his refusal to provide the drug due to his religious beliefs was not a violation of state and federal law. A jury ruled last year that the pharmacist did not discriminate against the woman. The panel of three judges has 90 days to rule on the appeal.",

The jury also awarded Anderson $25,000 due to emotional harm \u2014 money she can't collect because there was no finding of discrimination, said Jess Braverman, one of Anderson\u2019s lawyers.</p><p>Gender Justice, an advocacy organization for gender equity, and other lawyers for Anderson appealed the jury's ruling this year.</p><p>\u201cThis was pregnancy-related discrimination,\u201d Braverman, the legal director for Gender Justice, said in court Thursday.</p><p>Braverman added that Badeaux illegally discriminated against Anderson on the basis of her sex when he refused to fill her prescription for a drug that is only prescribed to women.</p><p>Anderson eventually got her prescription filled at a pharmacy in Brainerd, making the round-trip of more than 100 miles (161 kilometers) in wintry driving conditions in 2019.</p><p>Rory Gray, a lawyer for Badeaux, argued federal and state law would not classify Badeaux's actions as pregnancy discrimination.</p><p>The Minnesota Human Rights Act \u201cis focused on motives, not consequences,\" Gray said. \u201cMr. Badeaux had to have a discriminatory motive. The jury found that he did not. And that\u2019s backed up by the statute, which does not impact so much what is done as to why it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>Gray added that Badeaux was not focused on himself or on Anderson when he refused to fill the prescription. \u201cPrimarily, he was focused on a third party. And that\u2019s the life that\u2019s formed when an egg is fertilized,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>Braverman said it doesn't matter if Badeaux was trying to harm Anderson or not.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an element of a discrimination claim. It\u2019s simply whether they denied the person full and equal access to goods and services,\" Braverman said.</p><p>\u201cThe problem that happened here was that the court instructed the jury that if Mr. Badeaux didn\u2019t intend to cause Ms. Anderson harm and stigma and shame, then they have not committed discrimination. And that is not the law in Minnesota \u2014 it\u2019s whether you intended to discriminate, which we have ... uncontroverted testimony of that here,\" Braverman added.</p><p>The panel of three judges has 90 days to rule on the appeal.</p><p>Since the U.S. Supreme Court <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0\">ended</a> constitutional protections for abortion last year, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-legislature-idaho-birth-control-bd238c572da10d812ef5ba93f1860fc5\">some states</a> have expanded access to emergency contraceptives and birth control while <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-legislature-idaho-birth-control-bd238c572da10d812ef5ba93f1860fc5\">other states</a> have restricted access and enacted abortion bans.</p><p>Dozens of universities across the country now carry emergency contraceptives <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/plan-b-emergency-contraceptive-vending-machine-abortion-00ee797529a855b116a538575790098f\">in vending machines,</a> according to the American Society for Emergency Contraception.
