Perhaps someone at the table is struggling with a substance abuse issue or a mental health concern. And don't forget that person who is just mean and miserable and spoiling for a fight.</p><p>It can be enough to make you want to hit the eggnog extra hard. But experts in psychology and mental health say it doesn't have to be that way, and they offer suggestions for how to help manage gatherings that might be less than jolly:</p><hl2>KNOW YOUR \u201cWHY\u201d</hl2><p>It's important for people to know why they are going into situations they know could be tense or worse, says Ramani Durvasula, Ph.D, a licensed clinical psychologist who talks about the damage of narcissistic relationships.</p><p>Whether that's because there are other relatives they want to see or some other reason that is worth the potential drama, it's vital \u201cto be clear on the reason,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause otherwise you feel like you\u2019re just sort of a moth to the flame.\u201d</p><hl2>DON'T FALL FOR THE HOLIDAY HYPE</hl2><p>Watch enough holiday movies, and you could be lulled into thinking that a time of year where messages of hope and redemption are everywhere means your relationship with that conflict-prone person you have fought with in most other moments of your life will also somehow magically be all sunshine and roses.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s that kind of relationship-healing fantasy,\u201d says Tracy Hutchinson, Ph.D., who teaches in the graduate clinical mental health program at the College of William & Mary in Virginia. She says people want to believe \u201cmaybe this time it will be different, instead of just radically accepting that it probably won\u2019t be any different. But what can be different is the way that you approach the relationship and you approach the situation.\u201d</p><hl2>SOME SUBJECTS MIGHT BE BETTER OFF AVOIDED</hl2><p>With everything going on in the world today, it probably wouldn't be difficult to have that political issue or current event where you find yourself diametrically opposed to someone you otherwise think well of. Well, you don't have to talk about it, says Jeanne Safer, Ph. D., psychotherapist and author of, \u201cI Love You, But I Hate Your Politics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think people have a great deal of difficulty realizing that they can care about somebody and have a lot in common and all of those kinds of things and not be able to talk about politics,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk about everything.\u201d</p><hl2>BUT IF YOU DO, THE GOAL IS COMMUNICATION, NOT CASTIGATION</hl2><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go in trying to convince them that you\u2019re right and they\u2019re wrong,\u201d says Tania Israel, Ph. D., professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. \u201cWhat\u2019s best is to go in trying to understand them and communicate that you care.\u201d</p><p>If someone says something you disagree with, she says, you can say, \u201cTell me how you came to form that opinion, tell me a little bit about the connection that you have to that issue, what makes that so important to you, and ask them questions.\u201d</p><hl2>TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF</hl2><p>If you know your holiday family situation is likely to be tough, find ways to give yourself some moments of peace or distraction, Durvasula says, like going for a walk or taking some time to read a book or meditate. And don't overlook that it is the holiday season.</p><p>\u201cFind a way to commemorate or celebrate with healthy people, whoever those who might be,\u201d she says. \u201cThey might be a subset of your family. They may be friends, they may be colleagues, whoever they are, do that. So at least you feel that there\u2019s something that happened during that holiday season that felt meaningful to you.\u201d</p>",
