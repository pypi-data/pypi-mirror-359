Temperatures in the city that day were at about 40 degrees Celsius (105 Fahrenheit).</p><p>Fans lined up for hours before the show, and many accused organizers of failing to deliver enough water supplies for the more than 60,000 attending the concert at the Nilton Santos Stadium. They said they were not allowed to take their own water into the stadium.</p><p>The report by Rio's Forensic Medical Institute said Benevides' heat exposure led to a cardiorespiratory arrest. It also said she did not have preexisting conditions or substance abuse that could have led to her death.</p><p>The forensics expert who analyzed her body said in the document she had \u201cserious compromise of her lungs and sudden death\u201d due to the heat.</p><p>One of Benevides\u2019 friends, who also attended the concert, told local media outlets in November they had been given water while waiting to enter the stadium.</p><p>Organizers T4F said in a statement the company \u201cfollowed the best practices,\u201d complied with \u201cevery demand from authorities\u201d and \u201cdistributed thousands of bottles of water\u201d to fans. TF4 also denied it did not allow people to bring their own water to the concert.</p><p>TF4 also said Benevides \u201cwas promptly cared for by members of a rescue team and sent (to the hospital) in an intensive-care unit ambulance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn our 40 years in the business, this company had never registered a tragic episode\u201d like Benevides' death due to extreme heat, T4F said.</p><p>The office of Rio\u2019s public prosecutor has opened a criminal investigation. Rio police said in a statement on Wednesday that after the forensics report is analyzed \u201crepresentatives of the company organizing the event will be called to testify.\u201d</p><p>Benevides\u2019 death shook many in Brazil. She had taken her first flight to travel from the country\u2019s center-west region to see her favorite singer.</p><p>In a statement posted on Instagram after the death, Swift said the case had left her with a \u201cshattered heart.\u201d</p><p>Benevides's father, Jos\u00e9 Weiny Machado, told news website G1 he \u201cnever doubted the cause of death was the heat.\u201d</p><p>His lawyer, Jo\u00e3o Paulo Sales Delmondes, said in a video shared with journalists that the forensics report \u201cconfirms the failings of the event's organization.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAna Clara's family wants to wait until the investigations are finished to study what will unfold to punish those responsible in the criminal case and seek the necessary legal actions to claim for damages,\u201d he said.</p>",

It provides details about the cause of death, the conditions at the event, and the response from the event organizers. The document is relevant to the topic of health as it addresses the health risks associated with extreme heat exposure, the importance of proper hydration, and the potential consequences of inadequate event planning on attendees' health. However, it is not a general health article but rather a specific incident report, which slightly limits its broader applicability to the health topic."
