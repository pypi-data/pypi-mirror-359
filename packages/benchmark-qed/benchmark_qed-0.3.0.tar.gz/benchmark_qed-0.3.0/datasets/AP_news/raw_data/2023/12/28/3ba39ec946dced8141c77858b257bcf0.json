Officials say the blast on Tuesday also injured at least 83 people in the town of Totota in the central part of the West African country. One health official says many of the dead were buried in a mass grave because their remains were unrecognizable. Health authorities say an exact death toll was difficult to confirm because of how badly the bodies were burned. Similar deadly accidents have occurred elsewhere in Africa.",

While it does touch on health-related aspects, such as the number of injured people, the involvement of health officials, and the need for disaster management teams, the main focus is on the event itself rather than health issues. Therefore, it is somewhat relevant to the topic of health but not highly focused on it."
