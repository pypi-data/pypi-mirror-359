She says the 47-year-old's struggles with mental health issues and addiction have left him unable to manage his assets. The Oscar winning singer and actor on Wednesday filed the petition in Los Angeles Superior Court that would give her temporary control of the finances of Elijah Blue Allman. Cher\u2019s petition says that Allman is entitled to regular payments from a trust fund, but she fears any money will be spent on drugs. Allman told The Associated Press that he is \"of sound mind and body.\"",

But \u201cgiven his ongoing mental health and substance abuse issues,\u201d she is \u201cconcerned that any funds distributed to Elijah will be immediately spent on drugs, leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and putting Elijah\u2019s life at risk,\u201d the petition says.</p><p>Reached through his attorney, Elijah Allman said in a phone call with The Associated Press, \"I am well, and able, and of sound mind and body.\"</p><p>He declined to say whether he planned to oppose the petition, or give any further comment.</p><p>A court-ordered conservatorship is \u201curgently needed,\u201d Cher's filing says. A judge scheduled a January hearing on the issue.</p><p>The filing explicitly seeks to keep control of Elijah Allman's finances from his wife, Marieangela King, from whom he filed for divorce in 2021.</p><p>The two remain legally married. A filing from King in October says the couple had agreed to pause the divorce proceedings and work on their marriage, but she had not seen him in person in six months.</p><p>Cher's petition says the couple's \u201ctumultuous relationship has been marked by a cycle of drug addiction and mental health crises\" and that she believes King \u201cis not supportive of Elijah's recovery.\u201d</p><p>Emails seeking comment from an attorney for King and representatives for Cher were not immediately returned.</p><p>Cher has two sons, one from each of her marriages \u2014 54-year-old Chaz Bono with the late Sonny Bono, and Elijah Allman, who is the former singer and guitarist of the band Deadsy and is known professionally as P. Exeter Blue.</p><p>Conservatorships, known in some states as guardianships, allow courts to give relatives or others control over a person's money and, at times, their life decisions after they are deemed not competent to make such decisions for themselves.</p><p>The issue became widely known when what began as a temporary conservatorship over <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/britney-spears\">Britney Spears</a> became a years-long legal saga and fight with her father.</p>",

While it does touch on health-related topics such as mental health and substance abuse, the main focus is on the legal proceedings and family dynamics rather than health itself.
