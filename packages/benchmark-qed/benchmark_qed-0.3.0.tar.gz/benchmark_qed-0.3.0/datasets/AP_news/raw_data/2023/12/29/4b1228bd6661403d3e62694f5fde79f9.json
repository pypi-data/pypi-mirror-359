The ruling imposes a temporary injunction until March 31, with the judge saying \u201cirreparable harm will be caused\u201d if the laws come into force. The Restricting Public Consumption of Illegal Substances Act was passed by the B.C. provincial legislature in November, allowing fines and imprisonment for people who refuse to comply with police orders not to consume drugs within six meters of all building entrances and bus stops; within 15 meters of playgrounds, spray and wading pools, and skate parks; and in parks, beaches and sports fields.",

Since then more than 13,500 people have fatally overdosed in the province.</p><p>Brad West, one of the mayors who voiced concerns about public drug use, denounced the decision.</p><p>\u201cThe court is, once again, demonstrating how out of touch they are,\u201d said West, mayor of Port Coquitlam, located about 30 kilometers (19 miles) east of Vancouver. \u201cThe rules were very modest, providing just a small restriction on drug use in public places, especially where children are present.\"</p><p>\u201cIf this restriction doesn\u2019t stand, then we have truly entered the wild west of unrestricted drug use, anywhere and everywhere,\" he said.</p>",
