Commissioners voted 7-2 on Thursday for a motion declaring they have no plans for a pause and intend to move forward and issue licenses to companies selected to produce, process and sell medical marijuana. Supporters said the motion is intended to convey a message that they will not delay the program any longer unless ordered to do so by a court. However, a number of companies have filed a lawsuit challenging the license selection process as flawed and seeking to stop the awards.",

Under commission rules, the licenses will be awarded after license fees are paid.</p><p>However, several companies have filed lawsuits challenging the license selection process as flawed and seeking to stop the awards. Montgomery Circuit Judge James Anderson held a hearing Thursday on the injunction request but did not issue an immediate ruling.</p><p>Twenty-six companies have also requested hearings with the commission after their license applications were rejected.</p><p>Medical marijuana remains unavailable in Alabama more than two years after lawmakers <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alabama-health-marijuana-medical-marijuana-government-and-politics-4cdbc66232a19708a16146b274d43e93\">voted</a> to legalize it in 2021. The state had to develop rules, and the selection process has been bogged down in disputes. Commissioners paused the license process several times during the ongoing dispute.</p>",
