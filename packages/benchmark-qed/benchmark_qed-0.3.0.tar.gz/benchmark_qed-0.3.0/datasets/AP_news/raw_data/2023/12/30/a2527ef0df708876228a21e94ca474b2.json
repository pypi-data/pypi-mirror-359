    "description_summary": "An Idaho judge has denied a request by the state\u2019s top legal chief to throw out a lawsuit seeking to clarify the exemptions tucked inside the state\u2019s broad abortion ban. Instead, 4th District Judge Jason Scott on Friday narrowed the case to focus only on the circumstances where an abortion would be allowed and whether abortion care in emergency situations applies to Idaho\u2019s state constitutional right to enjoy and defend life and the right to secure safety. Scott\u2019s decision comes just two weeks after a hearing where Idaho\u2019s Attorney General Raul Labrador\u2019s office attempted to dismiss the case spearheaded by four women and several physicians. The case was filed earlier this year.",

Brad Little, Labrador, and the Idaho Board of Medicine as named defendants in the lawsuit \u2014 leaving the state of Idaho as the only remaining defendant. Scott called the long list of defendants as \u201credundant,\u201d saying that all three would be subject to whatever is ultimately decided in the lawsuit.</p><p>\u201cThis is only the beginning of this litigation, but the Attorney General is encouraged by this ruling,\u201d Labrador's office said in a statement. \u201cHe has long held that the named defendants were simply inappropriate, and that our legislatively passed laws do not violate the Idaho Constitution by narrowly limiting abortions or interfering with a doctor\u2019s right to practice medicine.\u201d</p><p>The four women named in the case were all denied abortions in Idaho after learning they were pregnant with fetuses that were unlikely to go to term or survive birth, and that the pregnancies also put them at risk of serious medical complications. All four traveled to Oregon or Washington for the procedures.</p><p>Idaho has several abortion bans, but notably Idaho lawmakers approved a ban as a trigger law in March of 2020, before the U.S. Supreme Court <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-dobbs-anniversary-state-laws-51c2a83899f133556e715342abfcface\">overturned Roe v. Wade.</a></p><p>At the time, any suggestion that the ban could harm pregnant people was quickly brushed off by the bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican Sen. Todd Lakey, who said during one debate that the health of the mother \u201cweighs less, yes, than the life of the child.\u201d</p><p>The trigger ban took effect in 2022. Since then, Idaho\u2019s roster of obstetricians and other pregnancy-related specialists has been shrinking.</p>",
