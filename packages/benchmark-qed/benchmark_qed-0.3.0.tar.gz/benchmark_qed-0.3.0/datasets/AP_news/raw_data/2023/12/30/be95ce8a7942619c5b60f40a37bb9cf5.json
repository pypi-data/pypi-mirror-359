But industry data shows thousands of new flavored products continue pouring into the country from China. The rise in new products continues despite a record number of vaping shipments seized at U.S. ports in recent months. The figures underscore the chaotic state of the nation\u2019s $7 billion vaping market. They also raise questions about how to stop the flow of fruit-flavored disposable e-cigarettes used by 1 in 10 American teens and adolescents.",

The products generated $3.2 billion in the first 11 months of this year.</p><p>The FDA has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/technology-science-business-health-126c438648d433fdfe987c397e576b26\">authorized a handful of e-cigarettes</a> for adult smokers and is still reviewing products from several major companies, including <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/fda-puts-firms-responsible-esco-bars-and-breeze-two-popular-disposable-e-cigarette-brands-notice\">Juul</a>. Regulators consider nearly all other e-cigarettes to be illegal.</p><p>\u201cThose committing illegal acts don\u2019t advertise their crimes, and those trying to import illegal tobacco products into the United States are no different,\" said FDA\u2019s tobacco director, Brian King, in a written response to AP questions. \u201cThe FDA and our federal partners are using tools, like import alerts, to stop these illegal tobacco products at the border and to deter countless others.\u201d</p><p>The rise in e-cigarettes sold continues despite a record number of products detained.</p><p>An FDA database shows officials \u201crefused\u201d entry to 148 containers or pallets of \u201ctobacco\u201d goods last month, consisting almost entirely of vaping products from China. Refused imports are typically destroyed.</p><p>Through the end of November, U.S. officials had refused 374 such shipments this year, more than double the 118 refused in 2022.</p><p>This year's items included $400,000 worth of <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/fda-puts-firms-responsible-esco-bars-and-breeze-two-popular-disposable-e-cigarette-brands-notice\">Esco Bars</a>, a disposable brand placed on a list of <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_1163.html\">banned imports</a> in May. The agency's posted data is often preliminary because it takes time to finalize refusals.</p><p>But recent history shows how easily companies can maneuver around import bans.</p><p>In July 2022, the FDA barred dozens of e-cigarettes from <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_1169.html\">Chinese manufacturer Fume</a>, including flavors Pineapple Ice and Blue Razz.</p><p>Fume sales dipped after the ban, but the company launched a slew of new products, posting $42 million in U.S. sales in the third quarter of 2023, the data shows. Roughly 98% of sales came from products not on the FDA\u2019s \u201cred list\u201d of products that can be detained.</p><p>Industry shipping tactics are also challenging the usefulness of import restrictions.</p><p>In July, FDA and customs officials <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ecigarettes-elf-bar-fda-teen-vaping-434dc600866cf2a626aa8c7a0063ac43\">intercepted $18 million worth of illegal vapes</a>, including <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ecigarettes-elf-bar-fda-disposable-vaping-5245aed253ca9cdcf119483bd9cee1f1\">leading brand Elf Bar</a>. But the shipments were mislabeled as shoes, toys and other items \u2014 not e-cigarettes \u2014 requiring officials to individually open and verify the contents of more than two dozen containers.</p><p>Circana, formerly IRI, restricts access to its data, which it sells to companies and researchers. A person not authorized to share it gave the AP access on condition of anonymity.</p><p>The FDA has no schedule for updating its import lists but said it is \u201cclosely monitoring\u201d instances where companies try to avoid detection.</p><p>\u201cThe FDA has a variety of tools at our disposal to take action against these tactics,\u201d FDA\u2019s King said.</p><p>The agency has limited powers to penalize foreign companies. Instead, regulators have sent <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/fda-warns-internet-retailers-selling-illegal-e-cigarettes-popular-among-youth\">hundreds of warning letters</a> to U.S. stores selling their products, but those are not legally binding.</p><p>Even as the FDA attempts to work with customs officials, it is struggling to complete a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/general-news-9ae0c0e7415549e29cb21fbaf7e401b3\">yearslong review</a> of applications submitted by manufacturers hoping to market their products to adults.</p><p>The few tobacco-flavored products currently authorized by FDA are deeply unpopular. Their combined sales were just $174 million, or 2.4% of the vaping marketplace this year, according to Circana.</p><p>\u201cNobody wants them,\u201d says Marc Silas, owner of 906 Vapor shop in Michigan. \u201cIf people wanted them, they\u2019d be on the shelves and they\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Deeply frustrated with the pace of FDA\u2019s review, public health groups have successfully sued the agency to speed up the process. The agency aimed to complete all major outstanding applications this year, but it recently said the process would stretch into next year.</p><p>The delays have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-vaping-us-food-and-drug-administration-robert-califf-63d2cc590965a6f5f39460e19f2a8607\">raised questions</a> about the viability of the the current regulatory framework for e-cigarettes.</p><p>\u201cFDA is trying to operate with an old model when the whole environment has changed,\u201d said Scott Ballin, a health policy consultant who previously worked for the American Heart Association. \u201cThey have this long line of products that have to be reviewed one by one and now they\u2019re in a giant hole.\u201d</p><p>One alternative approach would be to make decisions about entire classes of e-cigarettes, rather than <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/juul-banned-fda-e41c58872a0e7a202ca5244442accb04\">individual products</a>.</p><p>The idea initially came from small vaping manufacturers who did not have the money to conduct the large studies typical of FDA applications. Public health advocates concerned about the persistence of underage vaping have embraced it.</p><p>Halpern-Felsher, of Stanford University, is among those urging the FDA to ban all flavored disposable e-cigarettes, the products used by most of the 2 million underage teens who vape.</p><p>\u201cIf we continue down this path that we\u2019re on, we\u2019re just going to have new and continuing generations of young people addicted to nicotine,\u201d she said.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
