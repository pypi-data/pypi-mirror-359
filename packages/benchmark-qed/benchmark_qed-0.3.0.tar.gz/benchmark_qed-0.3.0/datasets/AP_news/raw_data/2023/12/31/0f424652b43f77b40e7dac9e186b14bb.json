John Fetterman acknowledges having \u201cdark conversations\u201d about harming himself before he hit \u201cthe emergency brake\u201d and sought treatment for depression. In an interview with NBC's `\"Meet the Press,\" the Pennsylvania Democrat described his thoughts at that time as, \u201cI can\u2019t be a blueprint for my children. I can\u2019t let them be left alone or not to understand why he would have done that.\" So he checked himself into Walter Reed National Military Medical Center last February. Fetterman wondered whether he'd survive politically. He said that \u201cwhen it got released where I was and where it was going, it was a big story. And so, I had assumed that that would be the end of my career.\u201d",

I can\u2019t let them be left alone or not to understand why he would have done that,\u201d the first-term Pennsylvania Democrat told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in a deeply personal and introspective interview taped before the broadcast that aired Sunday.</p><p>So <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/john-fetterman-hospital-clinical-depression-a9051b43a6b31725a4969b9302740cac\">he checked himself</a> into Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, last Feb. 15. \u201cThere was nowhere else to go,\u201d he said, describing how he often felt during his stay that \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any hope sometimes and like, \u2018What do I have left?\u2019\u201d</p><p>He also wondered whether he would survive politically.</p><p>\u201cWhen it got released where I was and where it was going, it was a big story. And so, I had assumed that that would be the end of my career,\u201d he said</p><p>When he sought treatment for clinical depression, Fetterman was still coping with the effects of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-pennsylvania-congress-30e7c32969c6a72a968247f7141ee68c\">the stroke</a> he had in May 2022, during his campaign for one of the Senate\u2019s most contested seats. \u201cMy heart technically stopped, and it was a very <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-pennsylvania-government-and-politics-0c413bfeb7b00ceae5c172c7fa33007e\">touch-and-go situation</a>,\u201d said Fetterman, 54. A pacemaker <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-health-government-and-politics-congress-0bedb2673ca27915afcbc84e36f42cfe\">was implanted</a> with a defibrillator to manage two heart conditions, atrial fibrillation and cardiomyopathy.</p><p>His <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-senate-race-2022-midterm-elections-93709b5b7ab4cef658f45751cd76c090\">victory</a> over Republican <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/mehmet-oz\">Mehmet Oz</a> had helped Democrats <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-democrats-senate-control-dbc67e0af0e126c948076ae580b3d5ec\">keep control</a> of the Senate and made him a national figure. It was the height of his political career. But he couldn\u2019t make it out of bed at his home in Braddock, in western Pennsylvania.</p><p>\u201cI really scared my kids, and they thought, \u2019You won, Dad. Why aren\u2019t we enough? Why are you still so sad? Why are you even more sad?' And it was hard for \u2014 to explain why I was. And, of course, a 9-year-old child wouldn\u2019t understand that. And it was awful,\u201d Fetterman said.</p><p>So much so that he said he \u201cpleaded not to go down to D.C.\u201d later that November for orientation sessions in Washington for newly elected lawmakers.</p><p>His favorite holiday was nearing, yet he was unable to think about getting Christmas presents for his children and \u201cdreading\u201d his swearing in on Capitol Hill early in the new year.</p><p>Within two months, he was at Walter Reed. Aides had described the new senator as being withdrawn and uninterested in eating, discussing work or the usual banter with staff.</p><p>\u201cThis is a conversation that I\u2019ve had with myself and anybody that knows they\u2019re unable to address their depression, is they start to have dark conversations with themself about self-harm,\u201d Fetterman said. \u201cAnd things continued to kind of tick off the list. And then I kind of hit the emergency brake.\"</p><p>He added, \u201cI knew I needed help.\u201d</p><p>Before checking into Walter Reed, Fetterman had never publicly discussed his battle with depression. He has since said that he has experienced it on and off throughout his life.</p><p>He <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fetterman-senate-pennsylvania-depression-1f3b8baa4ea0c6766e4ecbf454de51d5\">left Walter Reed</a> at the end of March after six weeks of inpatient treatment with his depression \u201cin remission,\u201d according to a statement from his office.</p><p>Doctors describe \u201cremission\u201d as when a patient responds to treatment so that they have returned to normal social function and they are indistinguishable from someone who has never had depression.</p><p>Fetterman has since become <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fetterman-depression-senate-return-hoodies-shorts-771886ba8f3caee9be9674d186cd656b\">a visible presence</a> in the Capitol, bantering with reporters, joking with Senate colleagues and speaking up at Senate hearings.</p><p>To others who are now \u201cfacing a really dark holiday time,\u201d Fetterman offered this guidance: \u201cI know that last year\u2019s was desolate. And this year\u2019s might be desolate. Next year\u2019s can be the best ever. And that\u2019s what happened for me.\u201d</p>",
