Authorities said that emergency personnel initially responded to two medical calls on Sunday at the church in the small community of Monroe. After a third call involving a family with headaches, the Monroe City Fire Department checked the building and found elevated levels of carbon monoxide, prompting the evacuation of the church. More people reported being ill later in the evening and police said in all 22 individuals were taken to out-of-area hospitals with hyperbaric chambers where the victims could be treated. The source of the poisoning had not been determined.",
