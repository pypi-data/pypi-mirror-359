Decriminalization, though, seems unlikely for Dominican women. Their country keeps an agreement with the Vatican, which implies that Catholicism is the official religion, and anti-abortion groups have clout in Congress. In spite of this, abortion activists keep fighting to try to protect women who already face poverty, gender violence and lack of appropriate health services. Here\u2019s a general look at the country\u2019s ban.",

Abortion rights activists argue that the country\u2019s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nayib-bukele-el-salvador-san-salvador-ece623e2ef5ad2c1dc201cc680652ef8\">total abortion ban</a> not only restricts women\u2019s reproductive choices but also puts their lives in danger.</p><p>Here\u2019s a look at the country\u2019s ban.</p><hl2>What role does religion play?</hl2><p>No other nation bears a Bible on its flag.</p><p>The country\u2019s motto is \u201cGod, Country, Freedom,\u201d and the government holds a concordat, or agreement, with the Vatican, which implies that the official religion is Catholicism, although the constitution allows freedom of worship.</p><p>The Catholic Church influences sex education. The \u201cLearning to Love\u201d program, recently implemented by the Ministry of Education, aims to reinforce Catholic values for students.</p><p>Catholics and evangelicals are united against decriminalizing abortion and hold sway among legislators. \u201cWe have gained a pro-life majority in Congress,\u201d said anti-abortion activist Marthar\u00eds Rivas. \u201cWe have always contributed to the debates, and bishops approach congressmen to talk.\u201d</p><hl2>Is abortion impossible?</hl2><p>No. In the countryside, ancestral knowledge is used to terminate pregnancies with concoctions. Some medical personnel in urban areas facilitate abortions with medications such as misoprostol.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not legal, but if someone calls, I know how to handle it,\u201d said a health worker who asked for anonymity to avoid prosecution. \u201cWe use prescriptions. It (misoprostol) is used to treat ulcers, so you can prescribe a B complex, an antacid and there won\u2019t be trouble.\u201d</p><p>In addition, there are <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-pills-bans-mexico-us-border-76352e344ab3bd6e9170288ef5eadf1d\">\u201cacompa\u00f1antes\u201d networks like in Mexico</a>, said activist Sergia Galv\u00e1n.</p><p>\u201cIn 1995, we had three clandestine abortion centers, but there came a time when the risks were too high,\u201d Galv\u00e1n said. \u201cHistorically we have had mechanisms, but they are insufficient in the midst of restrictions.\u201d</p><hl2>What about spontaneous abortions?</hl2><p>The situation in public hospitals is extremely delicate, said nurse Francisca Peguero. \u201cWe have seen teenagers dying in emergency rooms because doctors face a dilemma: If they treat them, they might be criminalized.\u201d</p><p>According to Peguero, clinics are monitored by police officers who, upon seeing a woman bleeding, can report her.</p><hl2>What do abortion rights activists want?</hl2><p>As a first step, abortion rights activists would like legal abortion access when the woman\u2019s life is at risk, when the pregnancy is the product of rape or incest and when fetal malformations are incompatible with life.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u2019s <a href=\"https://bit.ly/ap-twir\">collaboration</a> with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.
