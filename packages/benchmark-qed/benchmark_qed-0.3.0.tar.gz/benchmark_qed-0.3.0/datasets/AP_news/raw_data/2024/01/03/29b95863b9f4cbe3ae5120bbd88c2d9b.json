Senate President Pro Tempore Philip Baruth told colleagues that the off-session was not a normal one. He says the state had emergencies from flooding to public safety to the opioid epidemic. He says the Legislature is going to have to think bigger about how to avoid and mitigate climate change and flooding as well as balance the budget. He says the challenges are going to be tougher and lawmakers are going to have to work harder this session.",

(AP) \u2014 Recovery from the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/flash-flood-emergency-northeast-rain-evacuations-d1fa3bff68fd0adaa888e223d445c6a3\">catastrophic flooding</a> that hit Vermont this summer, climate resiliency, improving <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/shootings-palestinian-college-students-vermont-3d4f48f5253d572a81e641ccd74ec536\">public safety</a>, tackling opioid addiction, and creating more affordable housing are among the top priorities of the legislative session that kicked off Wednesday, legislative leaders said.</p><p>The legislative off-session was not a normal one, said Senate President Pro Tempore Philip Baruth, and a range of critical issues need lawmaker\u2019s attention this year.</p><p>\u201cWe had emergencies of various kinds around the state,\u201d the Democrat-Progressive told colleagues. \u201cSo our range of choices are going to be little narrower this year than they were last year. And yet we\u2019re going to have to think bigger about how to avoid and mitigate climate change and flooding, we\u2019re going to have dig deeper and we\u2019re going to have to balance the budget, which we always do.\u201d</p><p>Multiple bills are being introduced with different strategies to tackle flood recovery and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/vermont-flooding-businesses-rebuilding-climate-change-5f93b8e799f9ddd005e505df2865ed9a\">improve climate resiliency</a>, said House Speaker Jill Krowinski.</p><p>\"There\u2019s not one magic bill that\u2019s going to solve all of our problems when it comes to the flood recovery and so it\u2019s going to be a combination of things,\" she said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s support for families and small businesses that have been impacted, looking at ways to help deal with the water that comes through, through our rivers and dams, and looking at different policies around that.\u201d</p><p>The session opens as federal COVID-19 relief funding has ended, which means spending is returning to pre-pandemic levels. Most of the federal money has been committed and there's still a bit that needs to be designated and get out the door, Baruth said.</p><p>\u201cFor the first time in the last three or four years, we are going to have to make tougher choices about where to put our money,\u201d he said.</p><p>The one-time federal pandemic funds, Krowinski noted, were used for one-time policies and projects.</p><p>Concurrently, the state is grappling with rising opioid overdose deaths each year. The number jumped from 111 in 2019 to 237 in 2022. As of September 2023, there were 180 opioid overdose deaths in the state, with three months remaining to tally, according to the latest data from the Vermont Health Department.</p><p>Communities experiencing opioid misuse have had problems with needles discarded in public places like parks and greenbelts, said Baruth. \u201cWe have to act on that.\u201d</p><p>Legislators will look at a harm reduction bill that will include programs to gather in more needles. They will also consider starting a pilot program \u2014 in communities that are receptive to it \u2014 for overdose prevention centers, which include <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/safe-injection-sites-opioids-overdose-addiction-d9bcca2500044bfc28f54330bb719ffd\">safe injection sites</a> \u2014 places where people can use heroin and other narcotics under the supervision of trained staff and be revived if they take too much. Republican Gov. Phil Scott has opposed the idea.</p><p>Baruth said that like many people, he was skeptical in the past about safe injection sites. However, he said the current rise in overdose deaths and the use of drugs in public needs to be managed and supervised.</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re going to use let\u2019s control where they use, let\u2019s help them keep the needles safe \u2014 and let\u2019s get them services, wraparound services, while they visit with that site,\u201d Baruth said.</p>",
