Some new drugs modestly slow Alzheimer's worsening by attacking brain-clogging amyloid plaque, with doses every few weeks for well over a year. In a novel experiment, West Virginia University researchers added the ultrasound tool to three patients' drug doses for six months. In spots in the brain where that shield was opened, more plaque was cleared. The findings were published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Scientists have found a way to help Alzheimer\u2019s drugs seep inside the brain faster \u2014 by temporarily breaching its protective shield.</p><p>The novel experiment was a first attempt in just three patients. But in spots in the brain where the new technology took aim, it enhanced removal of Alzheimer\u2019s trademark brain-clogging plaque, researchers reported Wednesday.</p><p>\u201cOur goal is to give patients a head start,\u201d by boosting some new Alzheimer\u2019s treatments that take a long time to work, said Dr. Ali Rezai of West Virginia University\u2019s Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute, who led the study.</p><p>At issue is what\u2019s called the blood-brain barrier, a protective lining in blood vessels that prevents germs and other damaging substances from leaching into brain from the bloodstream. But it also can block <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-medication-b42dc8b32d71f1b6892b07d85e0e7da0\">drugs for Alzheimer\u2019s</a>, tumors and other neurologic diseases, requiring higher doses for longer periods for enough to reach their target inside the brain.</p><p>Now scientists are using a technology called focused ultrasound to jiggle temporary openings in that shield. They inject microscopic bubbles into the bloodstream. Next, they beam sound waves through a helmetlike device to a precise brain area. The pulses of energy vibrate the microbubbles, which loosen gaps in the barrier enough for medications to slip in.</p><p>Prior small studies have found the technology can safely poke tiny holes that seal up in 48 hours. Now Rezai\u2019s team has gone a step further \u2014 administering an Alzheimer\u2019s drug at the same time.</p><p>Some new Alzheimer\u2019s drugs, on the market or in the pipeline, promise to modestly slow worsening of the mind-robbing disease. They're designed to clear away a sticky protein called beta-amyloid that builds up in certain brain regions. But they require IV infusions every few weeks for at least 18 months.</p><p>\u201cWhy not try to clear the plaques within a few months?\u201d Rezai said, his rationale for the proof-of-concept study.</p><p>His team gave three patients with mild Alzheimer's monthly doses of one such drug, Aduhelm, for six months. Right after each IV, researchers aimed the focused ultrasound on a specific amyloid-clogged part of each patient\u2019s brain, opening the blood brain-barrier so more of that day\u2019s dose might enter that spot.</p><p>PET scans show patients\u2019 amyloid levels before and after the six months of medication. There was about 32% greater plaque reduction in spots where the blood-brain barrier was breached compared to the same region on the brain\u2019s opposite side, researchers reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p><p>This pilot study is elegant but too tiny to draw any conclusions, cautioned Dr. Eliezer Masliah of the National Institute on Aging.</p><p>Still, \"it's very exciting, compelling data,\u201d added Masliah, who wasn\u2019t involved with the research. \u201cIt opens the door for more extensive, larger studies definitely.\u201d</p><p>Rezai is about to begin another small test of a similar but better proven drug named <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alzheimers-drug-fda-approval-medicare-leqembi-a9c8b770aa1868a59889143c3bc9d127\">Leqembi</a>. Eventually large studies would be needed to tell if combining focused ultrasound with Alzheimer\u2019s drugs makes a real difference for patients.</p><p>Masliah said it's also important to closely check whether speedier plaque reduction might increase the risk of a rare but <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alzheimers-drug-lilly-amyloid-donanemab-1a031c94e3bdf05051377e848c3f730b\">worrisome side effect of these new drugs</a> \u2014 bleeding and swelling in the brain.</p><p>Alzheimer\u2019s isn\u2019t the only target. Other researchers are testing if breaching the blood-brain barrier could allow more chemotherapy to reach brain tumors, and ways to target other diseases.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
