    "description_summary": "Crib cameras are offering a clue to a rare but devastating tragedy _ when seemingly healthy young children suddenly die in their sleep and autopsies can\u2019t tell why. Similar to SIDS in babies, it\u2019s called sudden unexplained death in childhood, or SUDC, when it happens after age 1. In a small study, researchers analyzed video that captured the deaths of seven toddlers and found seizures sometimes play a role. Now they must figure out why. Researchers from NYU Langone Health reported the findings Thursday in the journal Neurology.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>The last bedtime of 17-month-old Hayden Fell\u2019s life was heartbreakingly normal. Crib video shows the toddler in pajamas playing happily as his parents and sister sang \u201cWheels on the Bus\u201d with his twin brother.</p><p>The next morning, Hayden\u2019s dad couldn\u2019t wake him. The tot had become one of several hundred seemingly healthy U.S. toddlers and preschoolers each year who suddenly die in their sleep and autopsies can\u2019t tell why. But Hayden\u2019s crib cam was recording all night \u2014 and offered a clue.</p><p>Seizures during sleep are a potential cause of at least some cases of sudden unexplained death in childhood, or SUDC, researchers at NYU Langone Health reported Thursday after analyzing home monitoring video that captured the deaths of seven sleeping toddlers.</p><p>Similar to <a href=\"https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/sids\">SIDS in babies</a>, SUDC is the term when these mysterious deaths occur any time after a child\u2019s first birthday. Little is known about SUDC but some scientists have long suspected seizures may play a role. In addition to some <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/genetics-sudden-unexplained-death-children\">genetics research</a>, scientists also have found that a history of fever-related seizures was about 10 times more likely among the children who died suddenly than among youngsters the same age.</p><p>The new study is very small but offers the first direct evidence of a seizure link. Five of the toddlers died shortly after movements deemed to be a brief seizure by a team of forensic pathologists, a seizure specialist and a sleep specialist. A sixth child probably also had one, according to findings published online by the journal Neurology.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to watch,\u201d said Dr. Orrin Devinsky, an NYU neurologist and the study\u2019s senior author. \u201cWe have video which is in some ways the best evidence we may ever get of what\u2019s happened to these kids.\u201d</p><p>The recordings can\u2019t prove fevers triggered the seizures but researchers noted several toddlers had signs of mild infections. One, Hayden, previously had such febrile seizures when he\u2019d catch childhood bugs.</p><p>That raises a big question: Fever-related seizures are hugely common in young children, affecting 2% to 5% of tots between ages 6 months and 5 years. While scary, they\u2019re hardly ever harmful. So how could anyone tell if occasionally, they might be a warning of something more serious?</p><p>\u201cI thought he would be fine and it was just a matter of letting this run its course,\u201d said Justin Fell, explaining how multiple doctors told the Bel Air, Maryland, family not to worry whenever Hayden had a fever-sparked seizure. Instead, \u201cit was every parent\u2019s nightmare.\u201d</p><p>Laura Gould, one of the NYU researchers, understands that agonizing frustration. In 1997 she lost her 15-month-old daughter Maria to what later was named SUDC \u2014 the toddler woke up one night with a fever, was her usual happy self the next morning but died during a nap. Gould later co-founded the nonprofit <a href=\"https://sudc.org/\">SUDC Foundation</a> and helped establish NYU's registry of about 300 deaths \u2014 including the first seven videos offered by families \u2014 for research.</p><p>Gould doesn't want families to be scared by the new findings \u2014 they won't change advice about febrile seizures. Instead, researchers next will have to determine if it\u2019s possible to tease out differences between those very rare children who die and the masses who are fine after an occasional seizure.</p><p>\u201cIf we can figure out the children at risk, maybe we can change their outcome,\" she said.</p><p>It\u2019s hard for autopsies to find evidence of a seizure so using video from home monitors to reevaluate deaths \u201cis actually very clever,\u201d said Dr. Marco Hefti, a neuropathologist at the University of Iowa who wasn\u2019t involved with the study but has also investigated SUDC.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that parents need to be stressing out, panicking about every febrile seizure,\u201d he cautioned. But Hefti said it's time for additional research, including animal studies and possibly sleep studies in children, to better understand what's going on.</p><p>SUDC is estimated to claim over 400 lives a year in the U.S. Most occur during sleep. And just over half, about 250 deaths a year, are in 1- to 4-year-olds.</p><p>Sudden death in babies occurs more often and gets more public attention \u2014 along with more research funding that in turn has uncovered risk factors and <a href=\"https://safetosleep.nichd.nih.gov/\">prevention advice</a> such as to put infants to sleep on their backs. But SUDC happens to youngsters long past the age of SIDS. The Fells had never even heard of it until Hayden died.</p><p>Hayden experienced his first seizure shortly before his first birthday, when a cold-like virus sparked a fever. Additional mild bugs triggered several more but Hayden always rapidly bounced back \u2014 until the night in November 2022 when he died.</p><p>Other recent studies, at NYU and by a team at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, have hunted genetic links to SUDC \u2014 finding that some children harbored mutations in genes associated with heart or brain disorders, including irregular heartbeats and epilepsy.</p><p>Heart problems, including those mutations, couldn't explain the deaths of the toddlers in the video study, Devinsky said. He cautioned that far more research is needed but said epilepsy patients sometimes experience difficulty breathing after a seizure that can lead to death \u2014 and raised the prospect that maybe some SIDS deaths could have seizure links, too.</p><p>Hayden's mom, Katie Czajkowski-Fell, hopes the video evidence helps finally lead to answers.</p><p>\u201cHis life, it was too precious and too important for us to not try and do something with this tragedy.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
