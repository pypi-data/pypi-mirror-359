The health care giant said Thursday that reducing its quarterly payout to shareholders to 25 cents per share will help free up capital to spend growing its pharmacy and health care businesses. New CEO Tim Wentworth said in a statement that company leaders believe such growth will ultimately improve shareholder value, but company shares slid in early-morning trading. Walgreens also announced a better-than-expected fiscal first quarter. The chain runs a network of around 13,000 drugstores globally.",
