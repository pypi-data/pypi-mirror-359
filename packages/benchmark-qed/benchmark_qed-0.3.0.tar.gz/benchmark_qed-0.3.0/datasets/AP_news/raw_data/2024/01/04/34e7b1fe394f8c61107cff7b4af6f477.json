The drugmaker said Thursday it will use the site, called LillyDirect, to pair visitors with third-party mail-order pharmacies for prescriptions and to care providers through a virtual medical weight-loss clinic. The site also offers a directory for in-person care and help with insulins and migraine treatments. Lilly says the doctors connected through the website are independent and not paid to promote its products, and the drugmaker also isn\u2019t paid to send referrals to them.",
