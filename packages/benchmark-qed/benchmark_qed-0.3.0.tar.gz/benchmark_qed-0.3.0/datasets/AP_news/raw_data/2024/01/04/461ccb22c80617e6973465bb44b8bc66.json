The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the federal lawsuit asks a judge to force the state to make improvements in its mental health system. It was filed Wednesday on behalf of families of four children with mental disorders that attorneys say worsened as the youths were institutionalized repeatedly and for long periods. They contend the state failed to provide adequate follow-up care to allow the children to remain at home. The agencies named in the lawsuit declined comment.",

It says one of the children has been institutionalized 16 times and admitted to emergency rooms 18 times, in part because the state failed to provide sufficient home care.</p><p>Attorneys for the families want the court to require the state to perform assessments for children who have been institutionalized multiple times and to provide better remedial care, among other improvements.</p>",
