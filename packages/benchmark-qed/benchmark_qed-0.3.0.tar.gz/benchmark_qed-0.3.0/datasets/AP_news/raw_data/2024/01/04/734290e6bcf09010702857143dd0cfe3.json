California Gov. Gavin Newsom and university officials announced the plan for the former Westside Pavilion at a news conference Wednesday. UCLA did not disclose costs but the joint venture companies that owned the 700,000-square-foot site say the University of California acquired it for $700 million. The mall shut down in the early 2000s. Google had recently planned to turn it into a massive office complex, but that project never came about. The university says Google helped enable UCLA\u2019s acquisition.",

He said it will take a little over three years to build out the research center and another two years to attract \u201cthe best and the brightest\u201d to work there.</p><p>\u201cIt will serve as a state-of-the-art hub of research and innovation that will bring together academics, corporate partners, government agencies and startups to explore new areas of inquiry and achieve breakthroughs that could serve the common good,\u201d UCLA Chancellor Gene Block told a news conference.</p><p>The mall shut down years ago.
