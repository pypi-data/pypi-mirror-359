    "description_summary": "The longest planned strike in the history of Britain\u2019s state-funded National Health Service has entered its second day of six with doctors in England at loggerheads with hospitals over requests for some to return to work to cover urgent needs. The British Medical Association said Thursday that hospitals haven't demonstrated they had \u201cexhausted\u201d all other sources of staffing before recalling doctors in the early stages of their careers. Hospital managers said filling out the forms to show they were overwhelmed took time and could undermine patient care. Junior doctors form the backbone of hospital and clinic care in England, and they plan to strike until the morning of Jan. 9.",

Junior doctors form the backbone of hospital and clinic care in England, and plans were laid out before this week's walkout for them to return to work if hospitals got overwhelmed.</p><p>The British Medical Association, the union that represents the bulk of the 75,000 or so striking doctors, had agreed with NHS managers on a system for so-called derogations, in which junior doctors return to work in the event of safety concerns about emergency care. Hospitals were expected to show they had \u201cexhausted\u201d all other sources of staffing before recalling the newer physicians.</p><p>On Wednesday, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/uk-doctors-strike-disruption-nhs-a5c550eaa82d22b91805f5e29da047c6\">the first day of the strike</a>, hospitals made 20 requests for junior doctors to return to work due to patient safety fears. A number of hospitals declared critical incidents, and others warned of significant waits in emergency rooms. None of the requests were granted.</p><p>It's unknown how many more appeals came from hospitals on Thursday.</p><p>The BMA said the refusal of hospitals to provide the necessary data \u201cis fundamentally undermining the derogation process.\" The NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals, said the form-filling took time and could undermine patient safety.</p><p>During the strike, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/uk-britain-senior-doctors-strikes-deal-bd1e4048152c43761fd759d91ee5c65d\">senior doctors</a>, known as consultants, are providing some of the care that their juniors usually provide. But there\u2019s not enough of them to fill the gap and NHS managers have said that tens of thousands of appointments and operations will be postponed because of the walkout.</p><p>The strike is taking place at a time when hospital admissions for flu and COVID-19 cases are running at their highest rate this winter, according to figures from the U.K. Health Security Agency.</p><p>\u201cThis latest round of strike action will not only have an impact on this week but will have an ongoing effect on the weeks and months ahead as we struggle to recover services and cope with heavy demand,\" NHS England National Medical Director Stephen Powis said.</p><p>Britain has endured a year of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/britain-doctors-strike-pay-dbf17778e72d4698d0ab0b213eee3643\">rolling strikes across the health sector</a> as staff sought pay rises to offset the soaring cost of living.</p><p>The BMA says newly qualified doctors earn 15.53 pounds (about $19) an hour \u2014 the U.K. minimum wage is just over 10 pounds (nearly $12.6) an hour \u2014 though salaries rise rapidly after the first year.</p><p>Nurses, ambulance crews and consultants have reached pay deals with the government, but negotiations with junior doctors broke down late last year. The government says it won\u2019t hold further talks unless doctors call off the strike, while the BMA says it won\u2019t negotiate unless it receives a \u201ccredible\u201d pay offer.</p><p>The government gave the doctors an 8.8% pay raise last year, but the union says it was not enough as pay has been cut by more than a quarter since 2008.</p><p>The hunior doctors are due to stay off the job until 7 a.m. on Jan. 9.</p><p>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said NHS leaders, independent of government, had his backing in urging the doctors to return to work.</p><p>\u201cThese strikes are disrupting people\u2019s lives,\" he said. \u201cThey are causing an enormous amount of concern to people.\u201d</p>",
