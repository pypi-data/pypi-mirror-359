Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary. It was the department\u2019s first acknowledgement that Austin had been admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. The Pentagon\u2019s failure to disclose Austin\u2019s hospitalization is counter to normal practice with other senior U.S. and Cabinet officials, including the president. Ryder says it\u2019s not clear when Austin will be released. He says the secretary is recovering well. Ryder says the hospitalization wasn't made public until now due to privacy and medical issues.",

Gen. Pat Ryder said Friday that it was not clear when Austin would be released from the hospital, but said the secretary was \u201crecovering well.\"</p><p>The Pentagon\u2019s failure to disclose Austin\u2019s hospitalization is counter to normal practice with the president and other senior U.S. officials and Cabinet members. The Pentagon Press Association, which represents media members who cover the Defense Department, sent a letter of protest to Ryder and Chris Meagher, the assistant defense secretary for public affairs.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that he has been at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for four days and the Pentagon is only now alerting the public late on a Friday evening is an outrage,\u201d the PPA said in its letter. \u201cAt a time when there are growing threats to U.S. military service members in the Middle East and the U.S. is playing key national security roles in the wars in Israel and Ukraine, it is particularly critical for the American public to be informed about the health status and decision-making ability of its top defense leader.\u201d</p><p>The White House has refused to say when or how it had been notified of Austin\u2019s hospitalization, and it referred questions to the Pentagon.</p><p>When Attorney General Merrick Garland went in for a routine medical procedure in 2022, his office informed the public a week in advance and outlined how long he was expected to be out and when he would return to work.</p><p>Ryder, the Pentagon spokesman, cited an \u201cevolving situation,\u201d and said that due to privacy and medical issues, the Pentagon did not make Austin\u2019s absence public. He declined to provide any other details about Austin\u2019s medical procedure or health.</p><p>Austin, 70, spent 41 years in the military, retiring as a four-star Army general in 2016.</p><p>In a statement, Ryder said that at all times, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks \u201cwas prepared to act for and exercise the powers of the Secretary, if required.\u201d</p><p>Austin's hospitalization comes as Iranian-backed militias have repeatedly launched drones, missiles and rockets at bases where U.S. troops are stationed in Iraq and Syria, leading the Biden administration to strike back on a number of occasions. Those strikes often involve sensitive, top-level discussions and decisions by Austin and other key military leaders.</p><p>The U.S. is also the chief organizer behind a new international maritime coalition using ships and other assets to patrol the southern Red Sea to deter persistent attacks on commercial vessels by Houthi militants in Yemen.</p><p>In addition, the administration, particularly Austin, has been at the forefront of the effort to supply weapons and training to Ukraine, and he's also been communicating frequently with the Israelis on their war against Hamas.</p>",
