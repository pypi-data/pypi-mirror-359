Tony Evers, who has pushed for full legalization of recreational marijuana, says he is open to a more limited medical marijuana legalization being promoted by Republicans. The Democrat told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he would prefer to get it all done at once, but if medical marijuana legalization is all that can be done now, he'll \"be supportive of that.\u201d Republicans planned to unveil the latest bill on Monday. GOP lawmakers have repeatedly rejected full legalization. A previous Republican-introduced measure legalizing medical marijuana failed to pass in 2022.",

GOP lawmakers have repeatedly <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-budget-evers-republicans-marijuana-brewers-074c187f3dcf74b5fad99e2f65dde10a\">rejected calls</a> from Evers and other Democrats to legalize all uses of marijuana, including medical and recreational.</p><p>Vos said the proposal would be limited and modeled after the medical marijuana law that had been in place in neighboring Minnesota before it <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/minnesota-marijuana-legalization-recreational-midwest-1f01d19ad33f59dbc529d6811f831bb4\">moved to full legalization</a>.</p><p>\u201cI'm glad that the governor is open to supporting our proposal,\" Vos said Friday. \"But if he keeps saying it\u2019s only a precursor to recreational marijuana, it will kill this proposal.\u201d</p><p>Republican state Sen. Mary Felzkowski, who <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-health-wisconsin-marijuana-legalization-3d1920c4696b5f88a1aaa2ad2e30d924\">introduced a medical marijuana bill</a> that got its first hearing in the Legislature in 2022, said she too was glad Evers was open to the idea. Felzkowski said she is not involved with the Assembly's latest proposal.</p><p>Evers said he had not yet seen the Republican bill but that he would support a limited proposal.</p><p>Democratic Sen. Melissa Agard, who has pushed for full legalization, said Republicans were not consulting with her on the bill and she also didn\u2019t know what it would include.</p><p>\u201cThe devil\u2019s in the details with all policy making,\u201d Agard said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to say I support or don\u2019t support something I haven\u2019t seen yet.\u201d</p><p>Wisconsin remains an outlier nationally. Thirty-eight states have legalized medical marijuana and 24 have legalized recreational marijuana. The push for legalization in Wisconsin has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-health-wisconsin-marijuana-legalization-3d1920c4696b5f88a1aaa2ad2e30d924\">gained momentum</a> as its neighbors have loosened laws.</p><p>Marquette University Law School polls have shown large majority support among Wisconsin residents for legalizing marijuana use for years.</p>",
