Investigators said Friday that they found high levels of chromium in cinnamon samples at the plant in Ecuador that made the pouches and in samples of recalled WanaBana apple cinnamon fruit puree. At least 287 people in 37 states may have been sickened by the tainted fruit pouches. Officials say consumers who ate the applesauce should seek medical care and discard the products.",

At least one adult has reported high blood lead levels after eating the lead-tainted pouches, but the median age of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wanabana-apple-cinnamon-lead-poisoning-fruit-pouch-86c32266e010843d0c9ad3340ccae319\">those sickened</a> is 1, the FDA said.</p><p>It's not clear what type of chromium was detected in the products, FDA investigators said.</p><p>Chromium is a naturally occurring element with traces typically found in the human diet. One form, called chromium III, is considered an essential nutrient. Another, chromium VI, is known to cause cancer.</p><p>The lead-to-chromium ratio found in the factory is consistent with lead chromate, a compound that has been previously reported as a contaminant in certain spices, officials said. But that finding is not definitive evidence that the substance was the contaminant in the pouches, they said.</p><p>Anyone who consumed <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigation-elevated-lead-levels-cinnamon-applesauce-pouches-november-2023\">the recalled pouches</a> should consult with a health care provider, the CDC said. There is no safe level of lead consumption, the agency emphasized.</p><p>The recalled pouches include those sold under the WanaBana brand at Dollar Tree stores and online and under the Schnucks and Weis brands in stores. Because they have a long shelf life, they may still be in consumers' homes. Consumers should not eat or serve the pouches and should discard them.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
