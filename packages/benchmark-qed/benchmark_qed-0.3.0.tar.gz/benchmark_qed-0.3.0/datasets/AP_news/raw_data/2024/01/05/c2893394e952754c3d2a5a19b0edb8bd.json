    "description_summary": "Federal officials have cleared the way for Florida to begin importing cheaper prescription drugs from Canada. It\u2019s the first time any U.S. state has used the approach and follows years of frustration with U.S. drug prices. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the plan into law in 2019, but it required approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Importing cheaper drugs has long been popular with patients and consumer groups, but faced years of pushback by the pharmaceutical industry. The politics of the issue have shifted in recent years. Both President Biden and former President Trump supported importing medications to help lower costs.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Food and Drug Administration on Friday cleared the way for Florida's first-in-the-nation <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-donald-trump-canada-florida-business-2badc4d292393e3393e212476a6de018\">plan to import prescription drugs</a> from Canada, a long-sought approach to accessing cheaper medications that follows decades of frustration with U.S. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/prescription-drug-costs\">drug prices</a>.</p><p>Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the plan into law in 2019, but it required federal review and approval by the FDA, which controls prescription drug imports.</p><p>Democratic President Joe Biden has backed such programs as a way to lower prices, signing an executive order in 2021 that directed the FDA to work with states on imports.</p><p>The White House called Friday\u2019s action \u201ca step in the right direction,\u201d and encouraged more states to apply for importation.</p><p>\u201cFor too long, Americans have been forced to pay the highest prescription drug prices of any developed nation,\u201d White House spokesperson Kelly Scully said in a statement.</p><p>But even as U.S. politicians applauded the plan, Canadian health providers said it was impractical given the supply challenges the country already faces.</p><p>\u201cHistorically, we\u2019ve had some pretty devastating drug shortages in Canada,\u201d Joelle Walker, spokesperson for the Canadian Pharmacists Association, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation \u201cSo the idea that they could import them from us is not really feasible.\"</p><p>The policy represents a major shift in the U.S. after years of successful lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry, which said imports would expose U.S. patients to risks of counterfeit or adulterated drugs. The FDA also previously warned of the difficulties of assuring the safety of drugs originating from outside the U.S.</p><p>But the politics surrounding the issue have shifted in recent years, with both parties \u2014 including <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/e9d09fe0ad100efe44992e0b9d9d0cbe\">former President Donald Trump</a> \u2014 doubling down on the import approach.</p><p>Jeff Johnson, director for AARP Florida, said he was excited about the federal decision, though he said it\u2019s only one step of many the group would like to see to help lower prescription drug costs. He noted savings won\u2019t be noticed by most people, but the state will save money overall.</p><p>\u201cUnless our healthcare coverage comes through Medicaid or through some another state-run program, we probably won\u2019t save that money on prescription drugs,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIf there are enough different things out there that help reduce drug prices, together they\u2019ll make a difference.\u201d</p><p>The FDA said Florida\u2019s program will be authorized for two years, though imports won't begin immediately. Under federal requirements, state officials must first test the drugs to make sure they\u2019re authentic and relabel them so that they comply with U.S. standards.</p><p>Florida\u2019s health department must also provide a quarterly report to the FDA on the types of drugs imported, cost savings and any potential safety and quality issues.</p><p>The FDA action was first reported by The New York Times.</p><p>DeSantis, who is battling Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, previously <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-lawsuits-florida-ron-desantis-57be1dbd66aae00b1912db8319352b01\">sued the Biden administration</a> for allegedly delaying approval of the import program. Several other states are also awaiting federal approval.</p><p>\u201cAfter years of federal bureaucrats dragging their feet, Florida will now be able to import low-cost, life-saving prescription drugs,\u201d said DeSantis in a statement.</p><p>The FDA is likely to face legal challenges over the decision, which the pharmaceutical industry's trade organization called \u201ca serious danger to public health.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are deeply concerned with the FDA\u2019s reckless decision to approve Florida\u2019s state importation plan,\" the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said in a statement Friday.</p><p>Many people already buy at least some of their medicines from pharmacies in Canada or Mexico, although technically it\u2019s illegal to import them.</p><p>Work on allowing state imports began under Trump, a relentless critic of industry pricing.</p><p>Under the current regulations, states can import certain medicines through pharmacies and wholesalers. DeSantis has previously estimated taxpayers could save up to $150 million annually under the program.</p><p>The state\u2019s proposal includes a number of drug classes, including medications for asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD; diabetes; HIV and AIDS; and mental illness.</p><p>The medications would be only for certain people, including foster children, inmates, certain elderly patients and \u2014 eventually \u2014 Medicaid recipients.</p><p>Like most developed nations, Canada sets limits on the prices drugmakers can charge if they wish to enter the market. Health officials there have suggested their country\u2019s prescription drug market is too small to have any real impact on U.S. prices.</p><p>Until recently, the U.S. government had almost no leverage over the prices set by drugmakers.
