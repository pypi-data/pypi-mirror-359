The lawsuit filed Thursday by the conservative group \u201cDo No Harm\u201d seeks a declaration that the law is unconstitutional. The 10-member State Board of Medical Examiners has one consumer member and nine physician members chosen from lists submitted by medical organizations and medical schools. The challenged law says that every other consumer member, every other member chosen from LSU medical centers in New Orleans and Shreveport, and every other member chosen from Louisiana Hospital Association nominees must be a minority member.",

One must be a \u201cconsumer member\u201d who does not need medical expertise. The other nine must be physicians chosen from among lists submitted by designated medical organizations and medical schools. For example, two must come from a list submitted by the Louisiana State Medical Society, and one from the LSU Health Sciences Center in New Orleans. Each member serves a four-year term.</p><p>The part of the law targeted in the lawsuit requires that every other consumer member, and every other member appointed from each of the lists compiled the LSU Health Sciences Center at New Orleans, the LSU Health Sciences Center at Shreveport and the Louisiana Hospital Association must be from a minority group.</p><p>\u201cDo No Harm has physician and consumer members who are qualified, willing, and able to be appointed to the Board if the racial mandate is enjoined,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cThe racial mandate prevents these members from equal consideration for appointment to the Board.\u201d</p><p>Gov.
