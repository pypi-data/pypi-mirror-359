Michelle Lujan Grisham that temporarily ban firearms at public parks and playgrounds by treating gun violence as a public health crisis. The state Supreme Court on Monday heard oral arguments in a lawsuit brought by Republican legislators, the National Rifle Association and several residents of the Albuquerque area including retired law enforcement officers. They accuse Lujan Grisham of overstepping her authority in violation of the Second Amendment and the state constitution. The governor says her emergency orders are warranted because of extremely dangerous conditions and drugs posing an imminent threat.",

Michelle Lujan Grisham restricting people from carrying guns at public parks and playgrounds in the state's largest metro area and address gun violence as a public health crisis.</p><p>The state Supreme Court heard oral arguments Monday without issuing a ruling in a lawsuit brought by Republican state legislators, the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/national-rifle-association\">National Rifle Association</a> and several residents of the Albuquerque area that include retired law enforcement officers, former federal agents, licensed firearms instructors and a gun-shop owner.</p><p>The state\u2019s legal standoff is one of many \u2014 from an <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-semiautomatic-weapon-ammunition-ban-gun-rights-2b1a3e9795814ba9c05ea8720cbb6f4d\">Illinois ban on high-powered rifles</a> to location-based restrictions in New York \u2014 since a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year expanded gun rights and as leaders in politically liberal-leaning states explore new avenues for restrictions. A California law was set to take effect Jan. 1 banning firearms in most public places, but a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/california-concealed-carry-gun-law-appeal-7fcf523c22d7c72bd95abf73604df0ad\">legal challenge</a> has held up implementation.</p><p>Lujan Grisham, a second-term Democrat, first invoked the orders in response to a spate of shootings that included the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/new-mexico-boy-shot-arrests-gun-ban-195a77de0d66c100b107d64c28fbba97\">death of an 11-year-old boy</a> outside a minor league baseball stadium.</p><p>Supreme Court justices questioned attorneys for more than an hour as they weighed whether to rein in the governor's use of emergency powers to restrict firearms. Outside the courthouse, there was an unusually heavy police presence with New Mexico State Police vehicles lining the street.</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me that there are guardrails, so to speak. \u2026 You have to say the nature of the public health emergency,\" Justice Michael E. Vigil, told an attorney for the governor. \u201cWhere is the statistical information showing that gun violence in public parks in Albuquerque and in Bernalillo County is a problem? There\u2019s nothing in these declarations that show that.\u201d</p><p>Justice Briana Zamora said New Mexico lawmakers have given the governor broader emergency powers in comparison with many states. She also sounded a cautionary note on executive authority.</p><p>\u201cIf we allow this, what are we not allowing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The high court adjourned without setting a deadline or a decision.</p><p>The petitioners say Lujan Grisham has overstepped her authority as governor in violation of the Second Amendment and that gun violence and drug abuse don't qualify as public health emergencies that can limit access to firearms even temporarily.</p><p>They accuse the governor of infringing on the Legislature's authority and overriding gun regulations that have been refined over the course of more than a century, including concealed handgun laws. The state Republican and Libertarian parties also support the legal challenge.</p><p>\u201cThe executive orders are so far outside and so contrary to the emergency statutes that, in their entirety, they are invalid \u2014 by trying to declare a state of emergency base on \u2018gun violence\u2019 and \u2018drug abuse,'\" attorney Jessica Hernandez argued Monday on behalf of gun rights advocates.</p><p>In defining what constitutes a public health emergency, the governor asserts that both gun violence and drug abuse \u201ccomfortably fall within\u201d the category because of extremely dangerous conditions posed by weapons and toxic chemical agents posing an imminent threat to many New Mexico residents.</p><p>The temporary orders don\u2019t violate constitutional rights, she says.</p><p>\"Those are the powers that the governor has, and those are the powers that she was reelected to use, again, in consultation with her public health experts about what constitutes an emergency,\u201d said Holly Agajanian, chief general counsel to the governor.</p><p>Separately, a federal judge has allowed enforcement of the gun provision to continue while legal challenges run their course. The October ruling by U.S. District Judge David Urias marked a victory for Lujan Grisham.</p><p>The governor's orders, first issued on Sept. 8, 2023, sparked public protests among gun rights advocates and additional legal challenges in federal court that are still underway.</p><p>Initial restrictions on carrying guns were scaled back from the original order that broadly suspended the right to carry guns in most public places, which the Bernalillo County sheriff and Albuquerque\u2019s police chief had refused to enforce.</p><p>The governor\u2019s health order includes directives for gun buyback efforts, monthly inspections of firearms dealers statewide, reports on gunshot victims at New Mexico hospitals and wastewater testing for indication of illicit drug use at public schools.</p><p>Longtime NRA leader <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nra-national-rifle-association-wayne-lapierre-resigns-a7cfcd45fc5406c86f186f403da83849\">Wayne LaPierre resigned</a> before Monday\u2019s start of a civil trial in New York over allegations he treated himself to lavish perks at the expense of the powerful gun rights group.</p>",

While the governor's orders are framed as addressing gun violence as a public health crisis, the main content revolves around legal arguments, Second Amendment rights, and the political implications of the orders. The document does touch on public health in the context of gun violence and drug abuse, but it is not the central theme. Therefore, the relevance to the topic of 'Health' is moderate."
