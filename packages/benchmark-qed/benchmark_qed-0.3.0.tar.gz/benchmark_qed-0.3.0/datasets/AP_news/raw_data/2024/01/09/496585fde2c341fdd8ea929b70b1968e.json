    "body_nitf": "<p>Indianapolis Business Journal. January 5, 2024.</p><p>Editorial: State push for recreational trails is a smart way to boost economy</p><p>An explosion in the development of recreational trails across Indiana through the state\u2019s $150 million Next Level Trails program holds great promise in improving Hoosier health, spurring economic development, boosting property values, and creating the kind of amenities that will attract talented workers.</p><p>Just last month, Gov. Eric Holcomb and the Department of Natural Resources announced 14 more recipients as part of the fourth round of Next Level Trails grants, providing a combined $31.2 million that will support 28 miles of new trails.</p><p>Among the biggest recipients are the Fall Creek Greenway in Lawrence and the Marquette Greenway, which will each receive $5 million. As Inside INdiana Business reported, other projects receiving funding include the Vision Trail Phase 1 in Randolph County and the Poka-Bache Trail in Steuben County</p><p>Local communities also have to have some skin in the game, providing a match of at least 20% that can include monetary contributions, land value or in-kind donations of materials and labor. This helps to guarantee community buy-in and puts the projects on the path to success.</p><p>When it comes to state-funded trails, however, the big kahuna is the South Monon Trail Project, which the governor last year announced would receive $29.5 million in state funds.</p><p>Construction began last summer on that trail, which will span more than 62 miles from New Albany to Mitchell and connect Floyd, Clark, Washington, Orange and Lawrence counties. It promises to become a cherished community amenity, offering dramatic views of farmland, forests and nearby state parks and recreational areas, and introducing visitors to the charm of small-town restaurants and shops along the way.</p><p>In Indianapolis, we already know the tremendous economic impacts of trails, thanks to public-private partnerships and the philanthropy of the Glick family.</p><p>According to a study by the <a href=\"undefined\">Indiana University</a> Public Policy Institute, neighborhood connections and amenities spurred by the Indianapolis Cultural Trail boosted nearby property values 148% from 2008 to 2014, and businesses along the trail reported increased revenue and the creation of more jobs. And now the trail is expanding along South Street and Indiana Avenue.</p><p>The Monon Trail, which runs from East 10th Street in Indianapolis north to Carmel, Westfield and Sheridan, has had a similar impact on its neighborhoods. Carmel this week announced a $13 million expansion of a key part of the trail through its Midtown, widening a 0.2-mile stretch from 14 feet to 140 feet. Work also continues on the Nickel Plate Trail and the Pennsy Trail.</p><p>Actually, the list of new trail projects, planned expansions and related amenities seems almost endless. Their positive impacts have been proven repeatedly.</p><p>Holcomb, the Legislature and local leaders clearly know a good thing when they see it. And the development of trails plays perfectly into the governor\u2019s vision to create appealing communities that will attract talented employees and encourage companies to locate and grow in Indiana.</p><p>___</p><p>Fort Wayne Journal Gazette. January 2, 2024.</p><p>Editorial: Hoosiers have governor, legislature to thank for drop in fatal overdoses</p><p>In 2016, more people died from drug overdoses in the U.S. than the total number of Americans killed in the Vietnam War. Indiana opioid overdose deaths rose 52% between 2015 and 2016. New, comprehensive strategies were needed at the state and federal levels to deal with the ongoing crisis.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t intend to make attacking the opioid epidemic a part of my agenda as governor,\u201d Gov. Eric Holcomb wrote in a piece published in the Indianapolis Star in September 2017. \u201cBut, as I traveled the state leading up to the 2016 election and saw firsthand the devastating effects of opioid addiction \u2014 I couldn\u2019t look away from the lives and communities I saw ravaged.\u201d</p><p>Less than a year later, the state had a strategic plan, Next Level Recovery, to fight addiction with a community-based approach. Today, Indiana is reaping the benefits of the new laws, programs and funding associated with that effort.</p><p>Last month, the Indiana Department of Health reported drug overdose deaths fell by 5% in 2022 \u2014 the first reported drop in overdose fatalities in four years.</p><p>Fatal overdoses tumbled by 10% in Allen County \u2014 twice the state rate \u2014 and nonfatal overdoses plummeted by 28% in 2022 compared with 2021, Fort Wayne Police Capt. Kevin Hunter told The Journal Gazette last week.</p><p>Douglas Huntsinger, executive director of Drug Prevention, Treatment and Enforcement for Indiana, credits the state\u2019s 20 recovery hubs that help Hoosiers find housing or employment, the expansion of residential treatment beds throughout Indiana and an increase in the distribution of naloxone \u2014 a drug that reverses opioid overdose \u2014 for the downward trend in deaths.</p><p>\u201cCommunities have recognized the urgency of this crisis and have joined forces to address it comprehensively,\u201d he said in December\u2019s Next Level Recovery Progress Report. \u201cBy combining our expertise, resources and perspectives, we\u2019re not only saving more lives from overdose, but we\u2019re creating a network of supports to aid individuals on their path to recovery.\u201d</p><p>Allen County\u2019s Hope and Recovery Team works closely with many local agencies to help residents access addiction treatment, including project.ME, the Indiana recovery hub for Allen and Whitley counties. Last month, the agency, staffed by former addicts, opened the area\u2019s first drop-in recovery center at 2305 Broadway.</p><p>Huntsinger attended its grand opening.</p><p>\u201cWhen I first met project.ME\u2019s Aisha Diss, she had just started leading one of #Indiana\u2019s first harm reduction street outreach teams,\u201d Huntsinger posted on Facebook. \u201cFast forward a couple of years later, and we\u2019re celebrating the opening of project.ME\u2019s new drop-in center, made possible by Aisha\u2019s passion and determination. This building opens even more opportunities for project.ME to serve Hoosiers in the NE region.\u201d</p><p>In June, the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration awarded project.ME nearly $300,000 to expand its Harm Reduction Street Outreach Program, which distributes naloxone to aid in the prevention of fatal overdoses and fentanyl test strips to screen for contamination of other drugs.</p><p>The YWCA of Northeast Indiana also received $2.2 million to renovate the former Don Hall\u2019s Guesthouse and expand both its domestic violence shelter and residential addictions treatment center from a total capacity of 96 beds to 244 beds.</p><p>Diss told The Journal Gazette she isn\u2019t surprised fatal and nonfatal overdoses have dropped in the state and Allen County. It shows the efforts of local organizations such as the Hope and Recovery Team, project.ME, Avenues Recovery and Fort Wayne Medical Society Alliance are working and more people are seeking rehabilitation from addiction.</p><p>Like Holcomb in 2016, those seeking to replace him as governor in January 2025 must recognize that addiction is a medical condition and not a moral failing. They should commit to continue providing programs and funding for addiction mitigation, as Holcomb has since 2017.</p><p>It took a crisis to force the state to act against the societal, economic and personal damage that addiction causes Indiana. Hoosiers should be thankful Holcomb and the General Assembly did so with resolve.</p><p>___</p><p>Tribune-Star. January 5, 2024.</p><p>Editorial: ISU needs to steady waters with next choice of next president</p><p>Indiana State University needs its next president to instill steady progress through the campus.</p><p>Likewise, Terre Haute needs ISU to do that. The university is the city\u2019s third-largest employer, behind only the Vigo County School Corp. and Union Hospital. Along with ISU\u2019s faculty and staff employees, its 8,300 students help comprise nearly one-sixth of Terre Haute\u2019s population.</p><p>Many Sycamore alums choose to stay here, work for local businesses, raise families, volunteer, attend houses of worship, pay taxes and send their kids to VCSC schools.</p><p>It matters greatly that ISU thrives in the future. At the moment, the university is struggling with uncertainty.</p><p>This week, the community learned that Sycamore Athletic Director Sherard Clinkscales had resigned, a seemingly sudden move. It came at an unusual moment, halfway through the university\u2019s 2023-24 athletic season. On Thursday, the Tribune-Star obtained a \u201cseparation and release agreement\u201d signed by Clinkscales and ISU President Deborah Curtis. The document explained that ISU and Clinkscales had \u201cmutually agreed\u201d that he would resign as athletic director effective Dec. 31. It also explained his severance package, which included 50 percent of his salary over the final 18 months of his contract, totaling $165,979, plus other benefits and considerations.</p><p>The agreement also included a \u201cnon-disparagement\u201d clause, obliging Clinkscales, Curtis and ISU to refrain from making derogatory comments about each other.</p><p>The university and its former AD indeed issued only praise for each other in the statements issued after Clinkscales\u2019 resignation became public. And, no other specific explanation for his departure has been given.</p><p>Regardless of the reason, the situation certainly leaves a high-profile segment of the university in some disarray. The university did, wisely, place the interim athletic director duties in the capable hands of longtime Sycamore athletic administrator Angie Lansing, ISU\u2019s senior associate AD and senior woman administrator. She served in the interim role once before, in 2016 just before former ISU President Dan Bradley hired Clinkscales.</p><p>The permanent role of AD undoubtedly will not be filled until a new ISU president is hired. Curtis is retiring effective June 30, 2024 \u2014 one year earlier than her contract had called for \u2014 under an agreement approved by the university\u2019s board on Dec. 15, 2023. The choice of Clinkscales long-term replacement should be made by that new president. That president and staff would be smart to choose Lansing for that position, if she would choose to take it.</p><p>ISU is certainly far more than just its athletics programs. Nonetheless, its teams and their events can serve as a bonding place for the greater community. Clinkscales had built a solid corps of coaches, and the teams experienced some strong successes for local residents to follow and enjoy. The highlights include the ISU men\u2019s basketball, baseball and men\u2019s and women\u2019s track and field programs, and a third-place finish in the Missouri Valley Conference\u2019s All-Sports Trophy race in 2021, the school\u2019s best finish since 2014.</p><p>Right now, Coach Josh Schertz\u2019s Sycamore men\u2019s basketball team sits atop the early standings of the Missouri Valley Conference, and the fan following is growing.</p><p>Other universities have seen athletic programs help in the recruitment of students in general. ISU definitely needs that jolt. The COVID-19 pandemic certainly hurt enrollments at colleges across America, including ISU. Still, the enrollment drop at Indiana State has been breathtaking. It fell to 8,305 students last fall, a decline of 4.1% from the previous year and down 36% from fall 2017\u2019s 13,045 total. In response to enrollment losses, ISU made about $12 million in budget cuts this over the course of a year, including a reorganization.</p><p>A new ISU president will face a handful of concerns when that person arrives in June. A search committee and the ISU Board of Trustees needs to make a stellar choice.</p><p>END</p>",
