Health Minister M\u00f3nica Garc\u00eda said late Monday that it was a simple and necessary measure. Spain\u2019s hospitals have come under immense pressure in recent weeks following a spike in cases of flu, COVID-19 and other bronchial problems. Garc\u00eda\u2019s ministry decided to impose the measure after failing to reach an agreement with regional health authorities, many of whom argued that mask use should be recommended but not obligatory. Six regions have already introduced the measure and masks have been commonly used on streets and public transport and in health centers in recent months.",
