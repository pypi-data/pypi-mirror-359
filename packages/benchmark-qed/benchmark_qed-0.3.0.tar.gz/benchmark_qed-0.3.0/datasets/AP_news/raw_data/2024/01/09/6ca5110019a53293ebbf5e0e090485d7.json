The states that chose not to opt in for this summer will have a chance to join for summer 2025, the USDA said.</p><hl2>Who is eligible for Summer EBT?</hl2><hl2></hl2><p>Families with children who are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches (that is, families who are at or under 185% of the federal poverty line) will be eligible for Summer EBT, which will cover about 70% of the eligible population in its first year.</p><p>In an October report, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hunger-food-us-increase-inflation-pandemic-report-49fe26f083583d6efa66c6509657a741\">the USDA said an estimated 17 million households in the U.S.</a> reported problems finding enough food in 2022. That was up from 13.5 million in 2021, when there was more pandemic-era federal food aid.</p><hl2>How much do families get?</hl2><hl2></hl2><p>Eligible families will receive $40 per month per child during the summer \u2014 a total of $120 per child. The money will be loaded on an EBT card, which can be used at stores that also take Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.</p><p>The USDA estimates it will provide a total of $2.5 billion in grocery benefits in 2024 through the Summer EBT program.</p><hl2>Who opted in?</hl2><p>The Cherokee Nation is one of the four tribes that'll be a part of the inaugural summer. Cherokee National Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. said it was an easy decision.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re seeing a lot of pressures on households in terms of rent or other housing costs, all of that hitting very finite household budgets,\u201d he said, adding, \u201c \u2026 This puts a dent in that overall problem by empowering parents to just simply be able to go out and purchase more food and some healthy options that are available.\u201d</p><p>The Cherokee Nation has its headquarters in Tahlequah, Oklahoma \u2014 a state that opted out of Summer EBT. Hoskin said he expects more applications from non-tribal citizens who live on the reservation.</p><hl2>Which states will not participate, and why?</hl2><p>Alabama, Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Vermont and Wyoming chose not to participate this summer.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nebraska-summer-ebt-food-program-children-789f2d04bd195086d2e41d0d43b8111c\">Nebraska</a>, <a href=\"https://hhs.iowa.gov/news-release/2023-12-22/summer-24-ebt\">Iowa</a> and Oklahoma cited existing programs that already feed children during the summer as reasons not to join Summer EBT.</p><p>Implementing a Summer EBT program this year was \u201cnot feasible\u201d in Texas, state Health and Human Services Commission spokesperson Thomas Vazquez said in a statement to the AP. He said that was due to USDA guidance coming in late December, \u201dthe level of effort needed\" to start a new program and the need for the state legislature to approve money for it.</p><p>Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said in a statement that he doesn't want \"a single Oklahoma child to go hungry, and I\u2019ll keep working to accomplish that, but large, duplicative federal programs don\u2019t accomplish that goal.</p><p>\u201cThey cause more bureaucracy for families to wade through.\u201d</p><hl2>What other federal summer food programs are available?</hl2><p>All 50 states already administer the Summer Food Service Program, which provides sites where kids can eat for free. Vilsack said he\u2019s worried it doesn't \u201cprovide the help for all the children, no matter how well-intentioned it is.\"</p><p>\u201cFor the life of me I don\u2019t see why 50 governors aren't doing (Summer EBT),\" he said, \"but we\u2019re happy that 35 are, we\u2019re happy that territories are in and we\u2019re happy that the tribes are continuing to work with us.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
