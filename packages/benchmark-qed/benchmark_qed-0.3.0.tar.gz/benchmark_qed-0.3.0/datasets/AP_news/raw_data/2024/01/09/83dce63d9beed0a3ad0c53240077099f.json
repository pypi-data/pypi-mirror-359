That includes posts about suicide, self-harm and eating disorders. The social media giant based in Menlo Park, California, said in a blog post Tuesday that while it already aims not to recommend such \u201cage-inappropriate\u201d material to teens, now it also won\u2019t show it in their feeds, even if it is shared by an account they follow. Meta\u2019s announcement comes as the company faces lawsuits from dozens of U.S. states for harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis.",

This is an important story, and can help destigmatize these issues, but it\u2019s a complex topic and isn\u2019t necessarily suitable for all young people,\u201d Meta said. \u201cNow, we\u2019ll start to remove this type of content from teens\u2019 experiences on Instagram and Facebook, as well as other types of age-inappropriate content.\u201d</p><p>Meta's announcement comes as the company faces lawsuits from <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/instagram-facebook-children-teens-harms-lawsuit-attorney-general-1805492a38f7cee111cbb865cc786c28\">dozens of U.S. states</a> that accuse it of harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis by knowingly and deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms.</p><p>Critics said Meta's moves don't go far enough.</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s announcement by Meta is yet another desperate attempt to avoid regulation and an incredible slap in the face to parents who have lost their kids to online harms on Instagram,\u201d said Josh Golin, executive director of the children's online advocacy group Fairplay. \u201cIf the company is capable of hiding pro-suicide and eating disorder content, why have they waited until 2024 to announce these changes?\u201d</p>",
