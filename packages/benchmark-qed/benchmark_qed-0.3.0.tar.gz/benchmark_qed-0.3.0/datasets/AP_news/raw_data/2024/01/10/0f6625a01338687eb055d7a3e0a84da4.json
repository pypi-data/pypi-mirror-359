That's a figure President Joe Biden will likely talk about regularly on the campaign trail as the Republican front-runner, former President Donald Trump, vows to dismantle the Obama-era program. Sign-ups in the marketplace have spiked during the Biden administration, thanks to tax subsidies that have given millions of Americans access to low cost plans, some with zero-dollar premiums. Open enrollment for coverage in 2024 is set to close Jan. 16.",

Signs-ups spiked after Biden took office, with Democrats rolling out a series of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-business-government-and-politics-d1580f615c8d2742c417d65a4b0c2244\">tax breaks</a> that give millions of Americans access to low cost plans, some with zero-dollar premiums.</p><p>\u201cWe must build upon this progress and make these lower health care premiums permanent,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cBut extreme Republicans have blocked these efforts at every turn.\u201d</p><p>The nation's top health official on Wednesday credited piqued interest in the coverage with an aggressive campaign to get people enrolled. The administration has worked with nonprofits across the the country, including in predominately Black and Latino communities, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-obamacare-trump-florida-latinos-election-89d5c33dc5761ab62dcdc680fca28446\">like South Florida</a>, to get new people into coverage. The administration has also invested millions more dollars into hiring <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-makes-largest-investment-ever-navigators-ahead-healthcaregov-open\">navigators</a> who help people enroll, a program that was decimated while President Donald Trump, a longtime critic of so-called \u201cObamacare,\u201d was in office.</p><p>\u201cThe previous administration made no effort to let people know what they could get,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said during an interview with MSNBC's \u201c <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/affordable-care-act-breaks-enrollment-record-201668677667\">Morning Joe</a>.\u201d \u201cWe're out there, we're not waiting for them to come to us. We're going to them.\"</p><p>But the increased enrollment news that the Biden administration celebrated on Wednesday has not come without cost. Some of the millions of new enrollees have only turned to the marketplace because they have been booted off Medicaid, the nearly free health care coverage offered to the poorest Americans or those with disabilities. The health plans they purchase through the marketplace will have higher premiums and copays for services.</p><p>Roughly <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/report-section/medicaid-enrollment-and-unwinding-tracker-overview/\">14.5 million Americans</a> have been recently kicked off Medicaid after the federal government lifted a 3-year ban that barred states from removing ineligible people from the government-sponsored health insurance. States began purging millions of people from Medicaid last year, during <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/medicaid-eligibility-texas-florida-disenrollments-fe7c10276e86ab909060dd6fbea60328\">an error-plagued process</a> that has left <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/medicaid-eligibility-children-computer-glitch-758dc1042375eda16d4973d521fe679f\">thousands</a> of children and pregnant women erroneously without health insurance coverage in some states.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, is regularly threatening on the campaign trail to undo the Biden administration's work on former President Barack Obama's signature health care law.</p><p>\u201cObamacare is a catastrophe, nobody talks about it,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Iowa on Saturday. The former president went on to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-iowa-caucuses-young-conservatives-campaign-2ca7441852577795123845811b06bc06\">criticize the late Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona</a> for blocking GOP efforts to scuttle the law more than five years ago.</p><p>Although open <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/\">enrollment</a> for health insurance plans purchased through the Affordable Care Act ends on Jan. 16., people who have been removed from Medicaid may be eligible to enroll through the end of July.</p>",
