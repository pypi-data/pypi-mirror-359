A study published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry says new prescriptions for stimulants used to treat the condition jumped 30% for young adults and women during a two-year window after the pandemic hit in March 2020. Prescriptions also soared for nonstimulant treatments for adults of all ages. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is one of the most common developmental disorders in children. Rising use of ADHD treatments and manufacturing problems triggered an Adderall shortage that started more than a year ago. Doctors and patients say supply problems for several treatments haven\u2019t let up.",

The use of drugs like Adderall to treat it climbed in general during the pandemic.</p><p>Telemedicine made it easier to get help, and regulators started allowing doctors to prescribe the drug without first seeing a patient in person.</p><p>But Dr. Ann Childress says more adults also started coming to her for help after COVID-19 hit. The Las Vegas psychiatrist sees several reasons behind the shift.</p><p>Working from home made some people realize how easily they get distracted. Childress says she diagnosed a lot of parents, especially moms, who saw it in their children and realized they may have it as well.</p><p>Plus, social media made people more aware of adult ADHD.</p><p>\u201cPeople are more open to talking about mental health issues now,\u201d said Childress, who was not involved in the study.</p><p>Rising use of ADHD treatments compounded with manufacturing problems triggered <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/drug-shortages-adderall-ozempic-855632a04a17c2bf75b6a89e4c08ef79\">an Adderall shortage</a> that started more than a year ago. Doctors and patients say supply problems for several treatments haven't let up.</p><p>\u201cEach week there about 10 things that are in shortage,\u201d Childress said.</p><p>Wendy Terry called nearly 20 pharmacies last month looking for the drug Focalin for her third-grade son, who has ADHD. Some were a 45-minute drive from her home in Diboll, Texas, a town about 100 miles northeast of Houston.</p><p>\u201cThey all told me the same thing: We can\u2019t get it from the manufacturer. We don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to get it or if we\u2019re going to get it,\u201d said the 42-year-old insurance agent.</p><p>Desperate, she briefly switched her son to another ADHD medication. But that went so badly that he had to miss school.</p><p>Terry eventually found a drugstore, thanks to a tip from a friend who works at another pharmacy. She says she dreads going through the ordeal again for a refill, but her son needs the help.</p><p>\u201cWhen he\u2019s not medicated, he literally can\u2019t sit down at school,\u201d Terry said. \u201cHe can\u2019t quit moving. He is constantly moving. His mind is all over the place.\u201d</p><p>Federal regulators limit the production of some ADHD treatments because they are controlled substances. Regulators and drugmakers try to anticipate how much of a drug will be needed based in part on how it has been used in the past, said Mike Ganio, who studies drug shortages at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.</p><p>But he noted that predicting demand is difficult, and spikes in use can contribute to shortages.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a business. Nobody wants to produce more, or hold on their shelves more, inventory than will be needed,\u201d he said.</p><p>Overall, the society counted more than 300 drug shortages in the U.S. as of last fall. Aside from ADHD drugs, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cancer-chemotherapy-drug-shortage-6a653e9f0878b4ddf05358fb90911952\">shortages of cancer treatments like chemotherapies</a> also have persisted.</p><p>Ganio noted that the latest shortage total is close to a 10-year high of 320 set in late 2014.</p><p>___</p><p>Murphy reported from Indianapolis.
