Representatives from 70 countries, the World Health Organization, and other international organizations are attending a two-day summit in Islamabad. It comes as reports show that thousands of people who lost their homes in the floods were still living in tents for the second consecutive harsh winter. The 2022 floods at one point left a third of Pakistan submerged. Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar told the meeting that \u201cno state in the world, no matter how powerful it is, can meet such challenges\u201d alone.",
