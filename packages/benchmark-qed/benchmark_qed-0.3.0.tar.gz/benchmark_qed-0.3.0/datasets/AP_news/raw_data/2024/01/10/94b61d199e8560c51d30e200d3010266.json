Laura Kelly renewed her call to expand Medicaid and countered an anticipated single-rate flat income tax for individuals with a plan that would instead cut taxes by doing things like accelerating the phasing out of the state\u2019s sales tax on groceries. Kelly said in her annual State of the State address Wednesday that her proposals are key to helping rural parts of the state. Kelly faces leaders of GOP supermajorities whose priorities are to cut income taxes and rein in local property taxes, not to expand Medicaid.",

That\u2019s who those costs get passed on to,\u201d he said.</p><p>Kansas is among only 10 states that have not expanded Medicaid in line with the 2010 federal Affordable Care Act, which promises federal funds to cover 90% of the new costs. In two other states, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/georgia-medicaid-expansion-brian-kemp-health-care-e6931d588c12c9cc13532dbd9b1e78b9\">Georgia and Mississippi</a>, top Republicans have signaled a willingness to discuss expansion this year, so the issue isn\u2019t a dead letter.</p><p>In Kansas, conservative opposition is rooted in small-government beliefs and decades of skepticism about social services. The federal government also is offering remaining non-expansion states another financial bonus. A promise of an additional $1.8 billion over two years was crucial for GOP lawmakers in North Carolina. Kelly\u2019s office expects Kansas to receive a total bonus of between $370 million and $450 million.</p><p>Kelly faces leaders of GOP supermajorities whose priorities are to cut income taxes and rein in local property taxes, not to expand Medicaid.</p><p>Her tax cut proposal, which she touted as far better than a flat personal income tax, also would eliminate taxes on retirees\u2019 Social Security incomes and reduce property taxes.</p><p>Kelly voiced opposition to the kind of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/school-vouchers-public-education-funding-kansas-88f7d2a5793c100e732d5ec38278da26\">sweeping plan</a> to use state education dollars to help parents pay for private or home schooling that states such as <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/politics-florida-nebraska-kim-reynolds-iowa-1fdab7c898730873b8c3b880223c5306\">Iowa</a>, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/education-vouchers-south-carolina-bill-signing-cf089d5b3fc42bd74a54f93abb1bf131\">South Carolina</a> and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/utah-state-government-arizona-iowa-south-carolina-kansas-091e6094fcea2852ec279fedf11759d8\">Utah</a> enacted.</p><p>\u201cVouchers will crush our rural schools, plain and simple,\" she said. \"Believe me, if you represent a rural area and you\u2019re out there pushing for vouchers, you\u2019ll be hearing from parents back home \u2013 wondering why you\u2019ve turned your back on their schools, and why you\u2019ve prioritized private schools hundreds of miles away.\"</p><p>She also described addressing water issues as \u201can existential issue\u201d not just for rural Kansas but the entire state.</p><p>\u201cMy goal for the rest of my term is to put Kansas on the path to resolving this crisis,\u201d she said.</p><p>The issue is dropping water levels in the Ogallala Aquifer, which covers roughly 175,000 square miles (453,000 square kilometers) in the western and Great Plains states of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, Wyoming and South Dakota.</p><p>Kansas produces more than 20% of the nation\u2019s wheat and has about 18% of the cattle being fed in the U.S. The western third of Kansas, home to most of its portion of the Ogallala, accounts for 60% of the value of all Kansas crops and livestock. That is possible because of the water.</p><p>Her comments came after state Supreme Court Chief Justice Marla Luckert told lawmakers earlier in the day that courts are getting closer to functioning normally after affiliates of a Russian-based <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kansas-courts-cyberattack-hack-network-offline-097a11cfa9de552ec5a9ea49b500d3d6\">ransomware</a> group infiltrated the system three months ago.</p><p>The public court portal is back online, and electronic filing also was restored Wednesday in two judicial districts, with the rest expected to follow within the next couple weeks.</p><p>Luckert stressed that the state didn\u2019t pay the ransom, and it is working to identify and notify those whose personal information was stolen.</p><p>\u201cWe are optimistic that full functionality of our systems, including appellate e-filing, is on the near horizon,\u201d Luckert said in her State of the Judiciary address .</p>",
