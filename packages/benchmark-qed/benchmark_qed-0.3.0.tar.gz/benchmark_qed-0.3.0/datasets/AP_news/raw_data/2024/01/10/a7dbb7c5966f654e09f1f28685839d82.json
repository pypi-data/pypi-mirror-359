Further, he says it\u2019s smart business.</p><p>\u201cTwenty percent of the population has some sort of disability and you start looking at game companies competing for eyeballs \u2014 all of a sudden, talking about, \u2018Hey, would you like to sell more games?\u2019 becomes a really powerful conversation.\u201d</p><p>When asked what advice they\u2019d give to game developers, panelists Liz Schmidlin, user research lead at PlayStation, and Michele Zorrilla, senior user experience researcher at Insomniac Games, echoed a similar statement: Start working accessibility conversations in early on in the design process.</p><p>Barlet added, \u201cGood accessibility is good design.\u201d</p><hl2>YOUR OWN PERSONAL ROBOTIC MASSEUSE</hl2><p>Artificial intelligence has been seen powering smart home hubs, cars, TVs, medical devices and even fingernail printers at CES 2024. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCvRXujeQlo\">Now it's giving massages</a>.</p><p>Created by French company Capsix Robotics, iYU uses artificial intelligence to perform a real-time body scan and recommend the best kind of experience for the user.
