The Republican governor's prepared speech to the Georgia Chamber of Commerce says he also wants to spend hundreds of millions to expand training for dentists and physicians. Kemp is making the proposals in advance of his State of the State speech on Thursday. They show how the state\u2019s $11 billion in surplus cash is giving the Republican the power to spend big even as state revenues slow. Kemp also says he\u2019ll need more than a year to complete an earlier pledge to limit lawsuits.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said Wednesday he'll propose $1.8 billion in added spending on infrastructure, as well as expand health care training for dentists and physicians, showing how the state's <a href=\"https://apnews.com/us-news/georgia-government-programs-general-news-5f726060c275f8ed9d520830d39952c5\">$11 billion in surplus cash</a> is giving the Republican clout to spend big even as state revenues slow.</p><p>Kemp also told the Georgia Chamber of Commerce at a meeting at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta that he'll need more than a year to follow through on a pledge to limit lawsuits. He also wants to make it harder for workers to unionize at the big developments Georgia is subsidizing.</p><p>\u201cIf we want to maintain this incredible position we\u2019re in today for another generation, we need to make smart moves right now to secure that future,\u201d Kemp said, arguing his plans would keep Georgia's economy humming.</p><p>Wednesday's speech by the second-term incumbent was a meaty preview of Thursday's looming State of the State address. Kemp promised more to come in the address, including a likely proposal to raise pay for public employees and teachers.</p><p>Republican House Speaker Jon Burns of Newington, also speaking Wednesday, voiced openness to expanding health care coverage to low-income adults through Georgia\u2019s Medicaid program.</p><p>\u201cExpanding access to care for lower income working families through a private option in a fiscally responsible way that lowers premiums is something we will continue to gather facts on in the House,\" Burns said.</p><p>Kemp says he wants to allot $1.5 billion to the Georgia Department of Transportation before June 30 to speed planned roadwork and establish a freight infrastructure program. Of that money, $200 million would go to cities and counties, increasing what the state sends local governments to maintain their own roads and bridges.</p><p>Kemp said he also wants to invest another $250 million in the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority, which loans money to local governments for water and sewer projects. Kemp previously <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-technology-health-business-covid-19-pandemic-a2ffef1839d8d34c84478abbc12cbfbf\">gave out $442 million</a> in water and sewer grants using federal COVID-19 aid.</p><p>The governor wants to allot another $50 million to a fund to develop land for housing, and then spend at least $6 million annually on such grants going forward. Lawmakers earlier allotted $35.7 million for Kemp's \u201crural workforce housing\u201d plan, and $17 million has been spent so far.</p><p>Kemp proposed spending $178 million to create a new public dental school at Georgia Southern University in Savannah, in addition to the current Dental College of Georgia at Augusta University. Kemp also proposed $50 million to create a separate medical school at the University of Georgia in Athens. Now, a four-year medical program operates there in partnership with the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University.</p><p>\u201cWith these new assets on the way, we will further address the growing need for health care professionals in our state,\u201d Kemp said.</p><p>Like he did before the chamber <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/brian-kemp-georgia-lawsuits-tort-reform-635183b3c85d616d1af18897af9eec9d\">in Athens this summer</a>, Kemp argued lawsuits are driving up insurance premiums and hampering business.</p><p>\u201cI will be introducing legislation this year that reflects my priorities to stabilize the market for insurers, stabilize premiums for Georgia families, and level the playing field in our courtrooms so we can continue to create even more quality, good-paying jobs,\u201d he said.</p><p>But Kemp now says the effort will take more than one legislative session, promising to take \u201cthe first step\u201d this year.</p><p>Georgia Chamber President and CEO Chris Clark said after the speech that limiting lawsuits has \u201calways been a difficult issue\u201d to make progress on. He said this year's steps would include a study to determine \u201cthe true impact of these nuclear verdicts\u201d on insurance rates.</p><p>Kemp also promised to make it harder for workers to form unions to bargain with employers in Georgia, echoing the chamber's own agenda. Kemp seeks to bar any business that benefits from state business incentives from allowing employees to unionize without a formal election. Now, businesses can accept unions without an election.</p><p>Only 4.4% of Georgia workers are union members, the eighth-lowest rate among states. Unions did win a notable victory in May when workers at Georgia school bus maker Blue Bird Corp. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/blue-bird-school-bus-georgia-union-steelworkers-f95e660aabb27abba9b6bd2606fbfc8e\">voted to be represented</a> by the United Steelworkers.</p><p>Kemp portrayed the move as protecting workers' \u201cright to opportunity\u201d from President Joe Biden's pro-union agenda and outside forces \u201cwho want nothing more than to see the free market brought to a screeching halt.\u201d</p><p>Burns said he wants to further cut taxes by increasing the deduction for a child on state income taxes from $3,000 to $4,000, which would save a typical family about $45. He also is seeking a slight cut in property taxes.</p><p>Burns also said he wants to boost the number of state troopers from 700 to 1,000 and expand state-paid prekindergarten classes.</p>",
