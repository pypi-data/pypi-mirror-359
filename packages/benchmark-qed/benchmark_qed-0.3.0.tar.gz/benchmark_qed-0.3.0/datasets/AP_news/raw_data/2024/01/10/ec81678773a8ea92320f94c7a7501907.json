Republicans are moving the ban in the first days of the 2024 legislation session. The proposal bars health professionals from performing gender transition surgery, prescribing puberty-blocking drugs or overseeing hormone therapy for anyone under 18 years old. Despite comments from conservative groups that the \u201cexperimental procedures\u201d are dangerous, major medical groups endorse transgender youth care as safe when administered properly. South Carolina pediatricians stress that minors in the state do not receive gender transition surgeries. They say the other forms of care are lifesaving for young people who might otherwise turn to self-harm.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) \u2014 Pleas from transgender children\u2019s pediatricians and parents to keep allowing such kids to receive hormone therapies failed to stop Republican lawmakers from advancing a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/gender-issues\">ban on those treatments</a> to the South Carolina House floor on Wednesday.</p><p>The GOP-led Medical, Military, Public and Municipal Affairs Committee voted to advance the bill within the first two days of the 2024 legislative session. At least 22 states have enacted similar restrictions amid recent Republican-led crackdowns on transgender medical care, bathroom usage and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/gender-in-sports\">sports participation</a>.</p><p>The speedy movement underscores South Carolina House Republicans' prioritization of the conservative issue at the outset of an election year that will pit incumbents against primary challengers from the right.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess125_2023-2024/bills/4624.htm\">bill</a> would bar health professionals from performing gender transition surgery, prescribing puberty-blocking drugs and overseeing hormone therapy for anyone under 18 years old. It also prevents Medicaid from covering such care for anyone under the age of 26.</p><p>Matt Sharp, senior counsel for a national Christian conservative advocacy group called the Alliance Defending Freedom, appeared virtually as the lone public testifier supporting the bill. Sharp, an out-of-state lawyer, claimed that children susceptible to \u201cpeer pressure\u201d might experience irreversible negative consequences later in life if \u201cexperimental procedures\u201d are allowed to continue.</p><p>Major medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-genderaffirming-care-pediatricians-176134f1b6ee1f2c146fef9a40cf351e\">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>, endorse transgender youth care as safe when administered properly.</p><p>South Carolina pediatricians stressed that minors in the state do not receive gender transition surgeries and that the other forms of care are lifesaving for young people who might otherwise turn to self-harm. Treatments occur with \u201cfully-involved\u201d parents' consent, according to Dr. Deborah Greenhouse. The pediatrician, who said she has cared for a number of transgender children over more than 30 years in the field, added that minors do not begin taking such medication until puberty begins.</p><p>Greenhouse said the proposed ban would make the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/video/children-chicago-associated-press-gender-national-066b52bc713040efadbd5452c72ff52d\">already difficult path</a> for transgender youth to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/genderaffirming-care-providers-treatment-parents-liability-45012ee33f078eeea7871e622a5eee1d\">obtain medical care</a> \u201ceven more torturous and virtually impossible to navigate.\u201d</p><p>Retired naval officer Dave Bell and Rebecca Bell, a software integrator, testified that their 15-year-old transgender daughter's \u201cpainful journey\u201d has ultimately alleviated her anxiety and depression, noting that she expressed a desire to die before they started letting her live as a young girl. They said their family visited seven times with an endocrinologist over a three-year period before their daughter started puberty blockers. Their daughter has been seeing mental health counselors for more than seven years, including a gender therapist.</p><p>Eric Childs, of Pelzer, said it's up to his 15-year-old transgender son to decide whether to undergo hormone replacement therapy and not lawmakers. He said his son hasn't begun the treatment but that the family wants to ensure he has every medically recommended option available. None of their health care decisions have been taken \u201con a whim,\" he added.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely every last bit of it has been a conversation: anxious, worried, whatever we could do in his best interest,\" Childs, who identified himself as a combat veteran, told the Associated Press.</p><p>In addition to banning gender transition surgery, puberty-blocking drugs and hormone therapies for minors, the bill would forbid school employees from withholding knowledge of a student\u2019s transgender identity from their legal guardians. Opponents decried this provision as \u201cforced outing\u201d that would place vulnerable children from unloving households at risk of homelessness and domestic abuse. Democrats said the move would overburden teachers who aren't trained to recognize gender dysphoria.</p><p>Republican state Rep. Jordan Pace said that when he was an educator, he thinks he would have been neglecting his duty if he had he ever concealed such information from parents.</p><p>\u201cParents need to know what's going on in their child's life,\u201d Republican state Rep. Thomas Beach said.</p><p>___</p><p>Pollard is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative. <a href=\"https://www.reportforamerica.org/\">Report for America</a> is a nonprofit national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on undercovered issues.</p>",
