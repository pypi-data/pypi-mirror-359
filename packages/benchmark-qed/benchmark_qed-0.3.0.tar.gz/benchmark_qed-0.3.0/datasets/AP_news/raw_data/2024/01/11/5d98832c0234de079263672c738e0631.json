    "description_summary": "Republican-led state legislatures are again considering bills restricting medical care for transgender youths and some adults the year after a wave of high-profile bills became law. Advocates for transgender rights say most of the states inclined to pass gender-affirming care bans have done so. They now expect those states to build upon those restrictions and expand them to adults. At least 22 states have enacted bans on gender affirming care for children. Most of them were approved in the past year. Major medical groups oppose the bans and have endorsed the care for youth. They say it\u2019s safe when administered properly.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>Republican-led state legislatures are considering a new round of bills restricting medical care for transgender youths \u2014 and in some cases, adults \u2014 returning to the issue the year after a wave of high-profile bills became law and sparked lawsuits.</p><p>As legislatures begin their work for the year, lawmakers in several states have proposed enacting or strengthening restrictions on puberty-blocking drugs and hormone treatments for minors. Bills to govern the pronouns kids can use at school, which sports teams students can play on, and the bathrooms they can use are back, as well, along with efforts to restrict drag performances and some books and school curriculums.</p><p>LGBTQ+ advocates say that most of the states inclined to pass bans on gender-affirming care have done so, and that they now expect them to build on those restrictions and expand them to include adults. With legislatures in most states up for election this year, transgender youths and their families worry about again being targeted by conservatives using them as a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/sports-texas-pennsylvania-campaigns-elections-5bb0f7fb8c162d9f4da5c935271bc255\">wedge issue.</a></p><p>They include Mandy Wong, a mother in Santa Barbara, California, who said she's tired of conservative politicians using transgender children as \u201ccampaign fuel.\u201d While she doesn\u2019t expect such a policy to pass in her Democrat-led state, Wong said, her child and his friends feel emotionally drained.</p><p>\u201cIt was just heartbreaking to tell him ... I don\u2019t think this is going away anytime soon,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the negative attention trans kids, even us as parents, have gotten because of these proposals doesn\u2019t seem to be dying down.\u201d</p><p>In Ohio, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ohio-dewine-transgender-surgery-minors-41c1f50cd115264625fd9d88cb1b78ce\">House Republicans voted Wednesday</a> to override Republican Gov. Mike DeWine's <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-health-ohio-minors-veto-c615cafed4fc81d32010d47d8853efaf\">veto</a> of legislation banning all forms of gender-affirming care for minors. The Senate is expected to follow suit this month. Despite his veto, DeWine signed an order banning the rare occurrence of gender-transition surgeries before adulthood. He also proposed rules mandating a care team for children and adults that critics say could severely restrict access for all patients.</p><p>In South Carolina, one of the few Southern states without a ban on gender-affirming care for minors, a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-carolina-republican-transgender-health-children-ec81678773a8ea92320f94c7a7501907\">House committee voted Wednesday</a> to send a ban to the House floor. The bill, sponsored by the state\u2019s Republican House speaker, would also prevent Medicaid from covering such treatments for anyone under age 26. And last week in New Hampshire, the House voted to ban gender-transition surgeries for minors.</p><p>At least 22 states have enacted bans on gender-affirming care for children, with most of them approved in the past year. Those who support the bans say they want to protect children and have concerns about the treatments themselves. Major medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-genderaffirming-care-pediatricians-176134f1b6ee1f2c146fef9a40cf351e\">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>, oppose the bans and have endorsed such care, saying it\u2019s safe when administered properly.</p><p>Last year's limits included a Florida law that has made it nearly impossible for many <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/florida-transgender-health-care-adults-e7ae55eec634923e6593a4c0685969b2\">transgender adults</a> in the state to receive gender-affirming care. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has promoted that ban as one of his accomplishments as he seeks the Republican presidential nomination.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll stop at nothing, so we don\u2019t know what exactly to anticipate (in 2024),\u201d said Katy Erker-Lynch, executive director of PROMO, an advocacy group in Missouri, where lawmakers have proposed more than 20 bills targeting LGBTQ+ people.</p><p>Bills filed in Missouri include efforts to remove two provisions that were key in overcoming a Democratic filibuster to that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-missouri-republican-govenrnor-sports-d0d3ef01544dc7c22592d8ca2464138b\">state's ban</a> on gender-affirming care for youths. The new Missouri Freedom Caucus is prioritizing a bill that would make the ban on gender-affirming care for minors permanent, removing a provision that allows it to expire in 2027. Legislation would also remove a clause that allows minors who began the care before the law went into effect to continue with it.</p><p>Republican state Sen. Mike Moon, who is sponsoring bills both to <a href=\"https://www.senate.mo.gov/24info/pdf-bill/intro/SB776.pdf\">repeal the expiration date</a> on the medical restrictions and to require schools to tell parents if a student wants to go by a name or pronoun other than the one the parent used to register the child for school, compared transgender medical restrictions for minors to age thresholds in laws for smoking, drinking and driving.</p><p>\u201cChildren, especially younger children, don\u2019t make good decisions, and they\u2019re not certain exactly what reality is sometimes,\u201d Moon said.</p><p>LGBTQ+ activists call laws that require schools to tell parents about a student's desire to change names or pronouns <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-students-pronouns-names-ec0b2c5de329d82c563ffb95262935f3\">\u201cforced outing,\u201d</a> saying schools might be the only safe place for a transgender or nonbinary student to express their gender identify.</p><p>Missouri's large number of filed bills has drawn attention from activists, but Republican legislative leaders say they don\u2019t think there\u2019s much of an appetite for revisiting the restrictions and don't want to prioritize them.</p><p>\u201cWe passed what I thought was a strong and fairly broad bill last year,\u201d said Missouri Senate President Pro Tem Caleb Rowden, referring to the medical ban.</p><p>In Oklahoma, at least two bills remain active from last year that target gender-affirming care for adults. One proposal would prohibit insurance coverage for the procedures for adults, while another would prohibit public funds from going to any entity that provides such care.</p><p>Both measures stalled in the Republican-controlled Legislature last year but could be reconsidered during the legislative session starting in February.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ohio-dewine-transgender-surgery-minors-41c1f50cd115264625fd9d88cb1b78ce\">rules proposed in Ohio by DeWine</a> last week place new limits on adults that advocates say would make treatment difficult, if not impossible, for some people. They include mandating a team for individuals that would consist of at least an endocrinologist, a bioethicist and a psychiatrist. The rules also would require departments to collect data submitted by medical providers on gender dysphoria and subsequent treatment.</p><p>Several bills have been filed in Florida, including a measure to require employees at state agencies or at any entity that receives state funding to use the pronouns consistent with their assigned sex at birth.</p><p>Legislation introduced Wednesday in West Virginia would ban gender-affirming care up to age 21 and prohibit mental health professionals from supporting what lawmakers call a transgender patient\u2019s \u201cdelusion\u201d about their gender identity.</p><p>In California, which has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-gender-affirming-care-health-texas-630f0a8ff873c33b7258cf0c3f6a2859\">offered refuge to transgender youths</a> and their families from states with medical bans, conservatives are mounting a longshot effort to put a measure on next year's ballot targeting the rights of transgender minors.</p><p>Nebraska state Sen. Kathleen Kauth, who last year sponsored the state\u2019s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-health-care-abortion-ban-nebraska-1a88067bf403559116df7c09e004e472\">gender-affirming care ban</a> for those under 19, said partisan politics are not behind her push for bills aimed at LGBTQ+ people. This year she is again pushing a bill she introduced last year that would restrict transgender students\u2019 participation in sports and limit their access to bathrooms and locker rooms.</p><p>Kauth\u2019s medical ban led progressive lawmakers to filibuster nearly every bill of last year\u2019s session.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that is designed to get reelected because, you know, my district is actually half and half \u2014 slightly more are conservative than liberal,\u201d Kauth said. \u201cI am about pushing back on federal government overreach, whatever it looks like, and protecting kids.\"</p><p>Nationwide, challenges to laws already in place are moving closer to the U.S. Supreme Court. The American Civil Liberties Union has asked the court to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tennessee-transgender-gender-affirming-care-ban-f58714b70298e2eb65ce833c2d4ae3b9\">block restrictions</a> on care for youths in Kentucky and Tennessee.</p><p>The full 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is also considering Arkansas' request to reverse a ruling that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/us-news/arkansas-gender-general-news-2a0d032f4e4f3195c180d879239e6521\">struck down</a> the state's first-in-the-nation ban on gender-affirming care for youths.</p><p>Federal rulings against the bans so far have come from judges appointed by both Democratic and Republican presidents.</p><p>__</p><p>DeMillo reported from Little Rock, Arkansas, and Schoenbaum from Salt Lake City.
