The Trumbull County prosecutor\u2019s office says a grand jury declined Thursday to charge 34-year-old Brittany Watts with felony corpse abuse. Watts\u2019 case sparked a national firestorm over legal risks pregnant women face as U.S. states hash out new laws governing reproductive health care access. Police said Watts miscarried, flushed and scooped out the toilet, then left home \u2014 leaving her 22-week-old fetus lodged in the pipes. Watts\u2019 attorney said Watts hopes her story is an impetus for change.",

Wade being overturned.</p><p>The announcement came hours before about 150 supporters gathered for a \u201cWe Stand With Brittany!\u201d rally on Warren\u2019s Courthouse Square. The event had been planned before Thursday\u2019s announcement of the grand jury\u2019s decision.</p><p>Watts was among several speakers who addressed the crowd.</p><p>\u201cI want to thank my community \u2014 Warren. Warren, Ohio. I was born here. I was raised here. I graduated high school here, and I\u2019m going to continue to stay here because I have to continue to fight,\u201d she said.</p><p>Watts' lawyer said an outpouring of emails, letters, calls, donations and prayers from the public helped her client endure the ordeal of being charged with a felony punishable by up to a year in prison.</p><p>\u201cNo matter how shocking or disturbing it may sound when presented in a public forum, it is simply the devastating reality of miscarriage,\u201d attorney Traci Timko said in a statement. \u201cWhile the last three months have been agonizing, we are incredibly grateful and relieved that justice was handed down by the grand jury today.\u201d</p><p>A municipal judge had found probable cause to bind over Watts\u2019 case after city prosecutors said she miscarried \u2014 clogging the toilet and removing some of its contents to an outdoor trash area \u2014 then left the house, leaving the 22-week-old fetus lodged in the pipes.</p><p>Watts had visited Mercy Health-St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, a Catholic facility in working-class Warren, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of Cleveland, twice in the days leading up to her miscarriage. Her doctor had told her she was carrying a nonviable fetus and to have her labor induced or risk \u201csignificant risk\u201d of death, according to records of her case.</p><p>Due to delays and other complications, her attorney said, she left each time without being treated. After she miscarried, she tried to go to a hair appointment, but friends sent her to the hospital.
