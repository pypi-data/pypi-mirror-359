And in honor of National Blood Donor Month and to celebrate donors, the Kentucky Blood Center (KBC) is offering those who donate between now and Jan. 20 a wildly popular hoodie that features a heathered oatmeal cotton/polyester blend and KBC\u2019s community-focused \u201cLive Local, Give Local\u201d message.</p><p>\u201cWe are nothing without our loyal donors,\u201d explained Mandy Brajuha, vice president of external relations at KBC. \u201cThe need for blood is constant, so we appreciate this opportunity to thank all those who take the time to roll up their sleeves to give blood. This is a great time of year to commit to donating blood more regularly or to give it a try for the first time.\u201d</p><p>Because it cannot be synthetically produced, blood is unique in the healthcare ecosystem \u2014 meaning it can only be provided by volunteer donors.</p><p>According to America\u2019s Blood Centers, only 3% of Americans currently donate blood despite 65% of the population being eligible to do so. In addition, less than 20% of blood donations come from individuals in communities of color, and donations from individuals aged 19-24 have declined by nearly 32% from 2019 to 2021.</p><p>The Kentucky Blood Center relies on volunteer donors to supply lifesaving blood products to more than 70 local hospitals. The current critical need is of four blood types \u2014 O-, A-, AB- and AB+ \u2014 of which there is less than a day\u2019s supply available of each.</p><p>In fact, every two seconds someone in the U.S. needs blood and one in four will need a blood transfusion in their lifetime. Why not pay it forward by resolving to help those in need this year?</p><p>Not only is donating blood rewarding, it is also easy. Whole blood donations take less than an hour from registration to refreshment and can save three lives, per the KBC \u2014 the commonwealth\u2019s largest, independent, full-service, nonprofit blood center.</p><p>The Frankfort donor center at 363 Versailles Road is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.</p><p>Blood donors must be at least 17 years old (16 with parental consent), weigh at least 110 pounds, be in general good health, show a photo I.D. and meet additional requirements. Sixteen-year-olds must have a signed parental permission slip, which can be found at <a href=\"https://kybloodcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/KBC541_online_022019.pdf\">kybloodcenter.org</a>.</p><p>END</p>",
