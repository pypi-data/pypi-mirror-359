Shares of UnitedHealth and other major health care and insurance providers slipped Friday after the company announced results. Health insurers dealt with rising medical costs for much of last year. UnitedHealth has said it saw a jump in claims from its Medicare Advantage business, as more seniors got heart and orthopedic outpatient procedures. Company leaders said claims also grew toward the end of the year because people sought vaccines and had other care addressed when they got those shots.",
