    "description_summary": "The prospect \u2014 albeit still dim \u2014 that Georgia could fully expand Medicaid has prompted Democrats and patient advocates to turn up the pressure on Republicans in the state legislature to act. But political experts, advocates and policy analysts say GOP lawmakers face significant headwinds to approving a plan they've long derided as wasteful, and that could ultimately doom the effort. Georgians for a Healthy Future Executive Director Laura Colbert says the biggest obstacle is Georgia Pathways. That's the state\u2019s limited Medicaid expansion that includes the nation\u2019s only work requirement for Medicaid recipients. Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has championed the program and may be unwilling to jettison it.",

Brian Kemp has championed the program, which launched in July. Though it is off to a rocky start, with just under 2,350 people enrolled as of mid-December, the Kemp administration has sought to extend it past its September 2025 expiration date.</p><p>\u201cGovernor Kemp has put a lot of political capital into Pathways,\u201d Colbert said.</p><p>Colbert said she was optimistic that Georgia lawmakers would eventually approve a fuller expansion of coverage for low-income adults, but not necessarily this year.</p><p>Kyle Wingfield, president of the conservative Georgia Public Policy Foundation, said he, too, was skeptical Kemp would be willing to retreat from Pathways.</p><p>He also warned that Republican lawmakers could face backlash for any Medicaid deal from Republican primary voters.</p><p>Expanding Medicaid to low-income adults who make up to 138% of the federal poverty level, with the federal government picking up 90% of the cost, was a key part of the Affordable Care Act. Georgia is among <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/\">10 states</a> that have not done it.</p><p>Wingfield said he thinks Republicans in Washington, and to a lesser extent in Georgia, have accepted that the Affordable Care Act is here to stay, but that acceptance may not be shared by rank-and-file GOP primary voters.</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to the voters in a Republican primary, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to be the one finding that out,\" he said.</p><p>But Brian Robinson, a Republican political consultant who counts the Georgia Alliance of Community Hospitals and House GOP caucus among his clients, says he thinks Republicans face little risk from primary opponents if they vote for Medicaid.</p><p>\u201cThe political issue of the danger has faded over the time,\" Robinson said. \"We\u2019ve had some mini-expansions in Georgia and there\u2019s been no blowback on Republicans. In fact they\u2019ve proudly touted it for groups like new mothers.\u201d</p><p>Republicans in Georgia also risk alienating the conservative organization Americans for Prosperity with a vote to expand Medicaid coverage.</p><p>The group is opposed to expansion, even as part of a deal that would repeal permitting requirements for hospitals and health services, said Tony West, the group's Georgia State Director. That sort of deal has emerged as a possible compromise between Republicans and Democrats.</p><p>West wants lawmakers to focus solely on repealing the permitting requirements and leave Medicaid expansion by the wayside.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re taking our eye off the ball,\u201d he said.</p><p>Conversely, Wingfield raised the possibility that some Democrats could balk at a deal, noting that Medicaid expansion has been a key political issue for the party in Georgia.</p><p>\"What do they gain from taking one of their signature issues off the table and letting the Republicans claim a large share of the credit for it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>At least for now, Democrats in the General Assembly don't appear concerned about losing their ability to hammer the GOP on Medicaid. The Democratic caucus organized a lengthy hearing Wednesday focused on the economic and health benefits of expansion that featured health care providers, advocates and policy experts.</p><p>In opening remarks, Democratic state Rep. Michelle Au, a doctor, noted Georgia had one of the highest rates of uninsured residents in the country and some of its worst health outcomes.</p><p>\u201dAs we start this 2024 legislative session, it is my hope that all options are on the table,\" she said.</p>",
