The centers would include safe injection sites \u2014 places where people can use heroin and other narcotics under the supervision of trained staff and be revived if they take too much. The legislation was approved by the House on Thursday and now goes to the state Senate. Supporters say such centers save lives and connect people with addiction treatment, mental health services and medical care. But some Vermont lawmaker who opposed the bill say such centers would allow illegal drug use and enable drug users. They also raised concerns about minors using drugs at them. Republican Gov. Phil Scott has said he is opposed to the idea.",

In 2022, there were 243 such deaths, more than the record 217 in 2021, said Rep. Taylor Small, a Progressive-Democrat from Winooski and a member of the House Human Services Committee. As of the end of September of 2023, the state had 180 in nine months last year.</p><p>\u201cWe are at a crisis point. We have been in an overdose death crisis for too long. And in a year where public safety seems to be at the forefront of our priorities, it is clear that we need to expand our approach to address this crisis,\u201d Small told colleagues on Wednesday.</p><p>The drugs bought and sold in Vermont are becoming increasingly dangerous and deadly, Small said, referring to fentanyl, the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-opioids-centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-7cb475c8559bf922265124e927e55bfd\">animal tranquilizer xylazine</a> and gabapentin.</p><p>Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, a Democrat from Brattleboro, said one of her favorite things about living in a small community is watching the town\u2019s kids grow up.</p><p>\u201cIn the last 10 years, I\u2019ve watched those children die,\u201d she said, her voice cracking. \u201cI\u2019ve also grieved the deaths of my friends\u2019 precious children, of my own loved ones, of clients. And we can\u2019t go on like this. I want my community to stay alive, and I want us in this body to do everything we can to make that happen.\u201d</p><p>Supporters say such centers save lives and connect people with addiction treatment, mental health services and medical care. But some Vermont lawmaker who opposed the bill said such centers would allow illegal drug use and enable drug users. They also raised concerns about minors using drugs at them.</p><p>Republican Gov. Phil Scott has said he is opposed to the idea and vetoed similar legislation two years ago.</p><p>_______</p><p>Rathke reported from Marshfield, Vermont.</p>",
