One such child is 10-year-old Princess, whose leg was injured in an accident in 2020. She now walks and continues to receive psychosocial support provided by the IREDE Foundation, which receives 70% of its funding through crowdsourcing. One orthopedic surgeon said such support brings relief for people with disabilities in a place like Nigeria where they often struggle with stigma.",

I was like, how is she going to cope with life with an amputated leg?\u201d</p><p>But Princess can now walk and her dreams are alive again, thanks to an artificial leg that matches the tone of her skin. The prosthesis came from the IREDE Foundation, a Nigerian group that provides children like her with free artificial limbs that normally cost $2,000 to $3,000.</p><p>\u201cMy dream is to become a model,\" Princess said. \"When the accident happened, I thought I couldn\u2019t become a model. But now that I have two legs, I can become whatever I want \u2014 model, doctor, whatever.\u201d</p><p>Founded in 2012 in Nigeria's economic hub of Lagos, IREDE has provided more than 500 artificial limbs at no cost in addition to psychosocial support to children like Princess, said its executive director, Crystal Chigbu. She said the group gets up to 70% of its funding from crowdsourcing.</p><p>Chigbu said her inspiration to start the foundation came from her daughter\u2019s experience with being born with limb deformity.</p><p>The child amputees the foundation has helped can \u201cdo things that they would never have imagined that they would do,\u201d said Chigbu.</p><p>While there is no verifiable data on how many Nigerians are living with amputated limbs, IREDE is one of several groups providing such services amid a great need.</p><p>It is a huge source of relief in Nigeria where people with disabilities struggle with stigma and limb replacements make them more accepted in their communities, said Dr. Olasode Isreal-Akinmokun, an orthopedic surgeon.</p><p>\u201cWe have limbs that function almost as perfectly as the limbs that have been lost,\u201d he said.</p><p>In addition to providing artificial limbs to children, Chigbu said, IREDE is also educating people about limb loss to deter stigma and it encourages support groups among parents of affected children.</p><p>\u201cWe come from a culture of people just saying (that) when you have a disability it is either taboo or people just look down on you. We are ensuring that whether it is in the school or even when they find themselves in the workplace as they grow, that people accept them and know that they have their abilities,\u201d she said.</p><p>___</p><p>Asadu reported from Abuja, Nigeria.</p>",
