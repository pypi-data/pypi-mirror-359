    "description_summary": "In a new twist in the abortion access fight, congressional Republicans are trying to block a Biden administration spending rule that they say will cut off millions of dollars to anti-abortion counseling centers. The rule would prohibit states from sending federal funds earmarked for needy Americans to so-called \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers,\u201d which counsel against abortions. Millions in federal funding currently flow to the organizations through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, a 1996 block grant program created to give cash assistance to poor children and prevent out-of-wedlock pregnancies. Republicans have introduced legislation to block the Health and Human Services Department from restricting funds for the centers, though it has no chance of becoming law this year.",

At stake are millions of dollars in federal funds that currently flow to the organizations through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, a block grant program created in 1996 to give cash assistance to poor children and prevent out-of-wedlock pregnancies.</p><p>\u201cPrograms that only or primarily provide pregnancy counseling to women only after they become pregnant likely do not meet the ... standard,\u201d the Health and Human Services agency said in its rule proposal released late last year.</p><p>More than 7,000 comments have been submitted on the proposed rule, which includes a series of restrictions on how states would be able to spend TANF dollars.</p><p>The proposal limiting funds for anti-abortion counseling centers is the Biden administration's latest attempt to introduce federal policies that expand abortion access. Conservative states, meanwhile, have severely restricted the care since the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0\">U.S. Supreme Court stripped women of their federal right to an abortion in 2022</a>.</p><p>Congressional Republicans this week introduced <a href=\"https://gop-waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/H.R.-6918-Bill-Text-1.pdf\">legislation</a> that would block the Health and Human Services Agency from restricting the funds from the centers. The bill has no chance of becoming law this year.</p><p>\u201cPregnancy centers are an important and vital alternative for expectant mothers,\u201d Republican Rep. Darin LaHood of Illinois said Thursday during a House Ways and Means Committee hearing to mark up the legislation.</p><p>The anti-abortion counseling centers have become an increasingly popular way for conservatives to sermonize against abortions, with an <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-business-health-nashville-personal-taxes-fffa6f6f86e6eaa448b8ea89087a1c46\">Associated Press investigation last year finding that states</a> have been sending more and more money to the programs over the last decade. More than a dozen states have given the centers roughly $500 million in taxpayer dollars since 2010. Last year, Pennsylvania's <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-pennsylvania-92c940a80f675f5b6cc6fd1642ea9ba3\">Democratic governor cut funding for all centers from the state budget</a>.</p><p>The centers\u2019 mission is controversial not only because workers often advise pregnant patients against seeking an abortion, but, critics say, the organizations can provide some misleading information about abortion and contraception, like suggesting that abortion can cause breast cancer. Most centers are religiously affiliated and not licensed healthcare facilities. They typically offer pregnancy tests and some offer limited medical services such as ultrasounds.</p><p>The Human Coalition, an anti-abortion organization that has locations in Georgia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Texas, estimates it would lose millions of dollars in funds, said Chelsey Youman, the group's national director of public policy. Plans to expand to Louisiana and Indiana could be put on hold if the rule goes through, she added.</p><p>Youman argues that her organization helps connect women to social services, like Medicaid, while persuading them to continue with their pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cThe work we do is truly compassionate and loving care for women who are facing sometimes the most difficult moment of their life,\u201d Youman said.</p><p>HHS is suggesting several tweaks that would change how states can use the $16.5 billion in block grants intended for the nation's neediest families. The proposal comes on the heels of a high-profile <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mississippi-welfare-scandal-congressional-investigation-89e5b02065894c0402c1dcc7a9a60e89\">corruption scandal</a> in Mississippi, where $77 million in TANF funds were squandered over several years.</p><p>The restrictions would limit how much of the money ends up benefitting middle- and high-income earners, with the agency saying that the percentage of impoverished families who get cash assistance has dropped from nearly 70% in 1996 to just over 21% in 2020. The plan would restrict how states use the money for college scholarships and child care, for example.</p>",
