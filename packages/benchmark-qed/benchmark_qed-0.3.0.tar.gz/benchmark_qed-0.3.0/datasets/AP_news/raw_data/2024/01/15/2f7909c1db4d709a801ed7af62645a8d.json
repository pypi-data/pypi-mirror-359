The death has spotlighted cruel conditions in the country\u2019s prisons. The respected Viasna human rights center said Monday that Vadzim Khrasko died of pneumonia in a penal colony near the northeastern city of Vitebsk after prison authorities had been slow to take him to a hospital and ignored his pleas for help. Khrasko died on Jan. 9. But officials only reported his death now. Belarusian authorities have cracked down on opponents of authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko after huge protests triggered by the August 2020 election. The balloting was viewed by the opposition and the West as fraudulent.",

He died on Jan. 9, but the penal colony only reported his death now.</p><p>Khrasko, an information technology specialist who died at the age of 50, was serving a three-year sentence on charges of offering donations to opposition groups that the authorities branded \"extremist.\"</p><p>Political activist <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/belarus-lukashenko-crackdown-human-rights-prison-524cc5731bf03f62ebbbe64f640944ad\">Leanid Sudalenka</a>, who served his three-year term at the same penal colony, told The Associated Press after finishing his term that he nearly died when COVID-19 swept through the facility. He said that he and other political prisoners had to wear a yellow tag on their uniforms, so they\u2019re easily identifiable to guards who he said routinely bullied, abused and humiliated them.</p><p>Sudalenka said that methods of bullying can range from punishment cells and complete information isolation, to refusing a meeting with a lawyer and the denial of medical care and medicine.</p><p>A few other prisoners haven\u2019t survived incarceration, including artist Ales Pushkin, who died in July of a perforated ulcer after receiving no medical care, and Vitold Ashurak, whose body was turned over to his relatives in 2021 still bearing a head bandage.</p><p>Belarusian authorities have cracked down on opponents of authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko after huge protests triggered by the August 2020 election that gave him a sixth term in office.

More than 35,000 people were arrested, thousands were beaten in police custody and hundreds of independent media outlets and nongovernmental organizations were shut down and outlawed.</p><p>More than 1,400 political prisoners remain behind bars, including leaders of opposition parties and renowned human rights advocate and 2022 Nobel Peace Prize winner <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/ales-bialiatski\">Ales Bialiatski</a>.</p><p>Belarusian <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/belarus-opposition-crackdown-tsikhanouskaya-prison-46cf9218194af68a448af70646edf425\">opposition leader-in-exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya</a>, who was forced to leave the country after challenging Lukashenko in the 2020 vote, called for an investigation into Khrasko's death.</p><p>\u201cI received the tragic news of the death of political prisoner Vadzim Khrasko, due to inadequate medical care,\u201d Tsikhanouskaya said. \u201cWe must act now to prevent more deaths.\u201d</p>",
