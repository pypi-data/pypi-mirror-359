The majority of those dead in the quakes in Zinda Jan and Injil districts were women and children, and 21,000 homes were destroyed, UNICEF said in a statement.</p><p>\u201cThe atmosphere in these villages is thick with suffering even 100 days after the earthquakes in western Afghanistan when families lost absolutely everything,\" said Fran Equiza, UNICEF representative in Afghanistan.</p><p>\"Children are still trying to cope with the loss and trauma. Schools and health centers, which children depend upon, are damaged beyond repair, or destroyed completely,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cAs if this was not enough, winter has taken hold and temperatures hover below freezing,\" Equiza said. \"Children and families without homes live in life-threatening conditions at night, with no way to heat their temporary shelters.\u201d</p><p>UNICEF said it urgently needs $1.4 billion in 2024 to meet the humanitarian and basic needs of 19.4 million Afghans, half of the population.</p><p>The Taliban\u2019s failure to invest in public services has contributed to the deterioration of basic services, hindering the ability of vulnerable communities to recover from shocks and build resilience, the agency added..</p><p>\u201cWe are grateful to our donor partners who mobilized resources quickly, enabling UNICEF to respond within days to the urgent needs of children and their families in Herat,\u201d Equiza said.</p><p>But more help is needed \u201cto ensure that children not only survive the winter but have a chance to thrive in the months and years to come,\u201d he added.</p><p>Daniel Timme, head of communications for UNICEF in Afghanistan, said schools, homes, health facilities and water systems were destroyed.</p><p>\u201cWe have money coming in but it\u2019s not enough. These communities need to be independent again. It\u2019s not enough to put out the fire.
