Advocates say the fight has resurfaced long-brewing ruptures among reproductive rights advocates, especially in Republican-leaning or closely divided states. Some worry that failing to include such limits will sink their chances of passing abortion protections. The conflict has been especially divisive in Missouri, where conflicting strategies are complicating efforts to push ahead with a ballot measure in a state with one of the nation's strictest abortion bans.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 Reproductive rights activists in Missouri agree they want to get a ballot measure before voters this fall to roll back one of the strictest abortion bans in the country and ensure access. The sticking point is how far they should go.</p><p>The groups have been at odds over whether to include a provision that would allow the state to regulate abortions after the fetus is viable, a concession supporters of the language say will be needed to persuade voters in the conservative state.</p><p>It's a divide that's not limited to Missouri.</p><p>Advocates say the disagreements there and in other states where activists are planning abortion-rights measures this year have resurfaced long-brewing ruptures among reproductive rights advocates. The divisions are most acute in Republican-leaning or closely divided states, where some worry that failing to include limits related to viability will sink the measures.</p><p>The conflict has been especially sharp in Missouri, where dueling strategies have complicated efforts to push ahead with a ballot measure seeking to reinstate the right to abortion.</p><p>\u201cThe movement is grappling with its value system,\u201d said Bonyen Lee-Gilmore, the Kansas City-based vice president of communications for the National Institute for Reproductive Health, which opposes viability clauses.</p><p>Viability is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. It's generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks into pregnancy but has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-technology-science-health-birmingham-7fc806f3c06aeae94c5d6ed1b06a6461\">shifted downward</a> with medical advances. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/advocacy/facts-are-important/understanding-and-navigating-viability\">opposes</a> viability language in legislation or regulations.</p><p>Some say it creates an arbitrary dividing line and stigmatizes abortions later in pregnancy, which are exceedingly rare and usually the result of serious complications, such as fetal anomalies, that put the life of the woman or fetus at risk.</p><p>The Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision established a constitutional right to abortion but also created a framework that allowed states to regulate abortions at certain points during pregnancy. Since the current court overturned it in 2022, \u201cRoe is the floor, not the ceiling\u201d has become a rallying cry for activists who vowed to rebuild access, especially for marginalized communities, according to Pamela Merritt, executive director of Medical Students for Choice, a group that opposes viability clauses.</p><p>Yet measures proposed for this year's ballot in Missouri, Florida and Arizona have been replicating Roe\u2019s viability framework, as did an Ohio <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ohio-abortion-amendment-election-2023-fe3e06747b616507d8ca21ea26485270\">constitutional amendment</a> guaranteeing the right to abortion that passed last year.</p><p>Shortly after that election, a Black Ohio woman who miscarried in her bathroom was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ohio-miscarriage-prosecution-brittany-watts-b8090abfb5994b8a23457b80cf3f27ce\">charged</a> with abuse of a corpse. The amendment\u2019s viability clause was cited as justification for allowing the case to move forward, though a grand jury <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/miscarriage-prosecution-ohio-brittany-watts-68145b3044b3cc61017b71a97f7cc036\">ultimately dismissed the case</a>.</p><p>The charges are part of a larger effort by anti-abortion forces in Ohio to use the viability clause to limit the reach of the amendment, said Merritt. Many of these efforts will wind up in Ohio\u2019s largely conservative court system, she added.</p><p>\u201cWhen you hand them the scalpel, you can\u2019t turn around and be surprised when they start cutting,\u201d Merritt said.</p><p>In South Dakota, the local Planned Parenthood affiliate has pulled out of ballot measure efforts for a proposal that allows lawmakers to restrict abortion after the first trimester. In a statement, the group said the proposal fails to protect abortion rights.</p><p>In Oklahoma, viability has been central to conversations about a potential ballot measure to repeal the state's abortion ban, said Rebecca Tong, co-executive director of Trust Women, which provides abortion care. Tong said viability is \u201cnot something we want written into the Constitution in Oklahoma.\u201d</p><p>But Lauren Brenzel, campaign director for Floridians Protecting Freedom, said viability has not been a major focus in conversations around ballot measure language in a state that could soon <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/florida-abortion-ban-approved-c9c53311a0b2426adc4b8d0b463edad1\">ban the procedure</a> after six weeks of pregnancy if the Florida Supreme Court upholds a previously passed 15-week ban. The campaign <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/florida-abortion-ballot-elections-931be34f9ffdd6d74f6beade05eeee47\">recently reached</a> the necessary number of verified signatures to qualify an abortion-rights measure for this year's ballot that includes a viability clause.</p><p>\u201cViability is the framework that Florida had used until the legislators started passing abortion bans,\u201d Brenzel said. \"What we know is that voters understand this, and we see it as clear and concise language that matches with what the standard was in Florida for a long time.\u201d</p><p>Viability language in Florida\u2019s proposed measure has already opened the door to a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ashley-moody-florida-politics-0db0a1a4deb47fa1b82410b7670b16e3\">legal challenge</a> from the state\u2019s Republican attorney general, who has asked the state Supreme Court to keep the measure off the ballot because of vagueness over the meaning of the term.</p><p>A few states, including California and Vermont, have enshrined abortion rights in their constitutions without viability limits. Proposed amendments in Maryland and New York also don\u2019t mention viability.</p><p>Missouri has found itself in the center of the national debate over the issue as abortion-rights groups have split over which of 11 versions of a measure to support for the ballot. The petitions have been tied up in court for months after being <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/missouri-abortion-ballot-measure-wording-0821671b0292823fbabbb30f6cdf9824\">challenged</a> by Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft.</p><p>Complicating the effort is another initiative petition \u2014 one proposed by a Republican, strategist Jamie Corley. It would allow abortions up to 12 weeks into pregnancy and include exceptions for rape, incest or to protect the life of the mother until viability.</p><p>Corley said those restrictions are what's feasible to pass in Missouri, where Republicans <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-us-supreme-court-missouri-government-and-politics-7bb5798bae32c3f15abad3a10941dfb5\">banned abortions</a> except in medical emergencies.</p><p>\u201cPro-life, anti-abortion voters, a lot of them are still OK with legal but limited access,\u201d Corley said.</p><p>Some reproductive rights groups advocating for versions of a more permissive ballot measure with a viability clause raised concerns that anti-abortion forces would attack proposals without one by saying it was an attempt to legalize <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ohio-constitutional-amendment-election-misinformation-d7b3d8273389a432b011964c14959789\">abortion \u201cup until birth\u201d</a> or \u201cabortion on demand,\u201d terms considered misleading by medical experts.</p><p>Sarah Standiford, national campaigns director of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said reproductive rights groups must balance their desire for the most expansive access with proposals that can withstand legal challenges and qualify for the ballot.</p><p>She acknowledged that such an approach \u201cmay ultimately advance a policy that is far short of the ideal.\u201d</p><p>Other activists say they\u2019re increasingly frustrated by compromises they see as based on fear and repeating past mistakes in Roe v. Wade that prevented abortion access for the most vulnerable, including people with higher-risk pregnancies, those with lower incomes, people of color and people living in rural communities.</p><p>\u201cIt is a restriction under the guise of reproductive freedom,\u201d said Jennifer Villavicencio, senior director of public affairs and advocacy at the Society of Family Planning.</p><p>In Missouri, it's yet to be seen how and if activists divided over viability will come together. To many, there\u2019s a sense of urgency to restore at least some rights.</p><p>\u201cReal lives are on the line, and that has to be part of these political considerations,\u201d said Mallory Schwarz, executive director of Abortion Action Missouri. \u201cWe have to consider both what is politically possible and also look at why that is possible in that moment.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Fernando reported from Chicago.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

While it is focused on the political and legal aspects of abortion rights, it is still highly relevant to the broader topic of health as it deals with reproductive health, medical definitions of viability, and the impact of legislation on healthcare access. The document also includes perspectives from healthcare providers and organizations, which further ties it to the health topic."
