Dan McKee promised in his annual State of the State address Tuesday.</p><p>One pledge McKee made was to increase the buying power of the state\u2019s residents in coming years by setting a goal to raise the per capita income in the state by at least $20,000 by 2030.</p><p>Within the next 100 days, the administration will roll out a game plan for raising incomes, the Democrat said.</p><p>McKee also said the budget for the new fiscal year that he'll be submitting to the General Assembly later this week will prioritize programs that will help raise incomes while also making key investments in education, small businesses, and health care \u2014 all without raising broad-based taxes.</p><p>\u201cJust think how much housing insecurity and food insecurity we could address as a state if we double down and work to raise per capita income across Rhode Island, helping every family,\u201d McKee said.</p><p>Another priority for the new year is education.</p><p>McKee said that last year, the administration set a challenge for Rhode Island to reach Massachusetts student achievement levels by 2030, including by raising scores on the Rhode Island Comprehensive Assessment System assesments.</p><p>He said he'll propose $15 million for math and English Language Arts coaching for students and professional development for teachers to help meet the goal.</p><p>Another challenge facing Rhode Island, and many neighboring states, is the lack of housing.</p><p>To help jumpstart production, McKee said he'll propose that a $100 million housing production bond be placed before voters. He said the initiative would be the largest housing production bond in the state\u2019s history.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to ensure that \u2013 if approved by the voters \u2013 these dollars will create more inventory and help put young people on a path to homeownership in our state,\u201d he said.</p><p>Health care is another top issue. McKee said he'll sign an executive order in coming weeks focused on improving Rhode Island\u2019s health care systems and working to ensure \"we have access to an efficient and effective health care delivery system aligned with our state\u2019s needs.\u201d</p><p>To help make Rhode Island a leader in life sciences McKee pointed to a new State Health Lab that is being built. He also noted his budget will also propose construction of a new life science school at the University of Rhode Island through a bond referendum.</p><p>Other high-paying jobs include those in cybersecurity. McKee said he wants Rhode Island College to dedicate itself to responding to the demand.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s pass a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity bond to grow RIC\u2019s current cybersecurity program into a cybersecurity school of choice,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in five years \u2013 let\u2019s have 1,000 students enrolled in this school graduating 250 students a year with these degrees.\"</p><p>On the tax front, McKee called for reducing the corporate minimum tax from $400 to $350 \u2013- a tax that he said impacts the state\u2019s smallest businesses the most. He also said he's targeting \u201csix annoying fees\u201d for elimination \u2013 including liquor manufacturing fees.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s finally pass an assault weapons ban in Rhode Island,\u201d he added.</p><p>The state is also looking ahead to its second offshore wind project, Revolution Wind, which is set to begin construction this year, he said. When complete, Revolution Wind will power nearly 263,000 households.</p><p>Another question McKee said he wants to put before voters on the 2024 ballot is whether the state should build a new State Archive and History Center to display the state's founding documents and important treasures.</p><p>Finally, McKee said the state is continuing to make strides on pitching itself as a destination, including to filmmakers, who used the state in the HBO series The Guilded Age.</p>",
