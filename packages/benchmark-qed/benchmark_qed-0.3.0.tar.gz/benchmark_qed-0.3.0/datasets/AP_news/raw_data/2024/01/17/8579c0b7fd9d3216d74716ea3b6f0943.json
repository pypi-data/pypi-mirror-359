But home heating systems running for hours can increase the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning as the deadly fumes can be produced by furnaces, stoves and heaters, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Carbon monoxide can also be created when people use portable generators or run cars in their garages to stay warm or charge their phones.</p><p>Dr. Alex Harding, assistant professor of emergency medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said that because carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless, people won\u2019t necessarily be aware of it.</p><p>\u201cThe symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning can be really insidious. They can sneak up on patients and can range from just developing a headache or maybe a little bit of nausea to all the way to losing consciousness and seizures,\u201d he said.</p><p>As Texas saw temperatures dip below freezing in January, Houston Fire Department Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a warned residents not to operate generators inside their homes or even in their garages.</p><p>\u201cWe all don\u2019t want you to sacrifice safety for warmth,\u201d Pe\u00f1a said.</p><hl2>DEALING WITH HYPOTHERMIA</hl2><p>Prolonged exposure to frigid temperatures can put people at risk to hypothermia, a condition that happens when one\u2019s body loses heat faster than it can produce it.</p><p>\u201cHypothermia is definitely one of the bigger concerns, especially if we do have any kind of certainty in like power grids or electricity failing,\u201d Harding said.</p><p>The danger of hypothermia is greater for someone who is outside, exposed to wind gusts and isn\u2019t <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/layer-up-clothing-weather-cold-warm-720e871a5181ba939f3f8219b39eccdb\">wearing appropriate clothing</a> or has clothing that gets wet.</p><p>\u201cIf they have a safe place that\u2019s warm, where they can hunker down, where they have water and food and all those kind of necessities \u2026 then that\u2019s going to limit their exposure to those risks,\u201d Harding said.</p><p>But vulnerable populations like people with disabilities or homeless individuals can have problems finding a warm and safe place to stay.</p><p>In Houston, officials have worked in recent years to improve their services for disabled individuals and homeless people during winter weather and other situations, like natural disasters, said Julian Ochoa, who is the Houston Office of Emergency Management\u2019s emergency preparedness manager for vulnerable populations.</p><hl2>PROTECTING YOUR HOME\u2019S PIPES</hl2><p>Frozen pipes in a home during severe winter weather is a particular problem in parts of the South because such equipment is often located outside structures. But other parts of the country also have to deal with this problem.</p><p>Jose Parra, a master plumber with Abacus Plumbing, Air Conditioning & Electrical in Houston, advises people to insulate any pipes that are exposed to the outside, turn off and drain sprinkler systems and let faucets inside a home drip during freezing temperatures so water can run through the pipes and protect them.</p><p>\u201cA lot of what we\u2019re fixing, I would say 80% to 90%, could have been prevented with just a little bit of work ahead of time,\u201d Parra said.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Juan A.
