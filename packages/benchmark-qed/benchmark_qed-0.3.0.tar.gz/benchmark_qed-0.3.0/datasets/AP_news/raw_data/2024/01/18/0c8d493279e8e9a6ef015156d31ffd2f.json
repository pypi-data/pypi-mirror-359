    "description_summary": "A year ago, anti-abortion activists from across the U.S. gathered for their annual March for Life with reason to celebrate. It was their first march since the Supreme Court, seven months earlier, had overturned the nationwide right to abortion. At this year\u2019s march, on Friday in Washington, the mood will be different \u2013 reflecting challenges lying ahead in this election year. March participants will salute the 14 states enforcing bans on abortion throughout pregnancy. However, anti-abortion leaders know that their side has a seven-state losing streak in votes on abortion-related ballot measures. Even in red states such as Ohio, Kansas and Kentucky, outcomes favored protecting abortion access.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>A year ago, anti-abortion activists from across the U.S. gathered for <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-florida-state-government-kentucky-6ed9dbcdaae33312f1425ea38b681a7e\">their annual March for Life</a> with reason to celebrate: It was their first march since the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0\">Supreme Court</a>, seven months earlier, had overturned the nationwide right to abortion.</p><p>At this year\u2019s march, on Friday, the mood will be very different \u2014 reflecting formidable challenges that lie ahead in this election year.</p><p>\u201cWe have undeniable evidence of victory \u2014 lives being saved,\u201d said John Seago, president of Texas Right to Life. \u201cBut there is also a realization of the significant hurdles that our movement has right now in the public conversation.\u201d</p><p>Participants at the march in Washington will salute the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-exception-lawsuit-legislature-confusion-b2808df90937e96887aa4e1f9c565771\">14 states enforcing bans</a> on abortion throughout pregnancy. They will proclaim that thousands of babies have been born who otherwise might have been aborted, even as <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-count-dobbs-ruling-states-3acdfba421b9f4a5ea0003de6c67260b\">studies show</a> the total number of abortions provided in the U.S. rose slightly in the year after that enforcement began.</p><p>Moreover, anti-abortion leaders know that their side has a seven-state losing streak in votes on abortion-related ballot measures. Even in red states such as <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ohio-abortion-amendment-election-2023-fe3e06747b616507d8ca21ea26485270\">Ohio</a>, Kansas and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-kentucky-abortion-3fa387a4cdc355d50a223f4788aa0ae8\">Kentucky</a>, the outcomes favored keeping abortion access legal.</p><p>In this year\u2019s election, several more states are expected to have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ballot-measure-2024-state-vote-e7d635835dc3a440789ad87787553ec1\">abortion-rights ballot measures</a>, and Democratic candidates in many races, including <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-kamala-harris-abortion-c634452da5e103913982e1cc5a0cae78\">President Joe Biden</a>, will be highlighting their support for abortion access.</p><p>\u201cWe have been around for more than 50 years, and I don\u2019t know of any year that was easy,\u201d said Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee.</p><p>\u201cBut it definitely got harder after Dobbs,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have a lot of work ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>Tobias was referring to the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization ruling in June 2022, overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide.</p><p>The key consequence of Dobbs was to return decision-making on abortion policy to individual states. Some Democratic-governed states \u2014 such as California, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-new-york-doctor-protection-shield-161fc73174a04f68e93c4312b3b21ea0\">New York</a> and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-politics-health-new-jersey-state-government-006f9a1182946397c9e79342ad80c778\">New Jersey</a> \u2014 have strengthened protections for abortion access. Roughly 20 states with Republican-controlled legislatures have either banned abortion or sought to impose new restrictions.</p><p>After Dobbs, \u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone to get the false sense that we were at the end of our work,\u201d said Brent Leatherwood, an abortion opponent who heads the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s public policy wing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve gone from a focal point at the federal level to 50 different focal points,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may be another 50 years before we truly establish a culture of life, where preborn lives are saved and mothers are supported.\u201d</p><p>Even the current claims of lives being saved due to the Dobbs decision are subject to question. While abortions have decreased to nearly zero in states with total bans, they have increased elsewhere \u2013 notably in states such as Illinois, Florida and New Mexico, which are near those with more restrictions.</p><p>Anti-abortion leaders are keenly aware that their opponents in the abortion debate depict the wave of state bans as an infringement on women\u2019s rights and a potential danger to their health.</p><p>Thus the theme of this year\u2019s March for Life strives to convey support for women facing unexpected pregnancies: \u201cPro Life: With Every Woman, For Every Child.\u201d</p><p>\u201c <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-business-health-nashville-personal-taxes-fffa6f6f86e6eaa448b8ea89087a1c46\">Pregnancy care centers</a> and maternity homes are the very backbone of our movement,\u201d March for Life president Jeanne Mancini wrote in a recent opinion piece.</p><p>She and her allies have encouraged states to offer support programs for new mothers in need \u2014 helping them find housing, jobs and health insurance.</p><p>Among the scheduled speakers at the march is Jean Marie Davis, executive director of Branches Pregnancy Resource Center in Brattleboro, Vermont. Davis says a similar center in New Hampshire helped her break free several years ago after she became pregnant while ensnared in a sex-trafficking operation.</p><p>Other scheduled speakers include House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., a co-chair of the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus.</p><p>Mancini said last year\u2019s march drew tens of thousands of people; she\u2019s hoping this year\u2019s march will be bigger.</p><p>The participants, she said, will be in a \u201cpersevering mood.\u201d</p><p>J.J. Straight, part of an American Civil Liberties Union team working to protect and broaden abortion access, says her side also feels determined, especially in light of the recent ballot-measure results.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a tremendous pushback to the anti-abortion agenda,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge coalition of folks, regardless of their party and other demographics, who absolutely draw the line at this kind interference in their health care.\u201d</p><p>Among the reasons for uncertainty for all parties in the debate is the inconsistent way that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-exception-lawsuit-legislature-confusion-b2808df90937e96887aa4e1f9c565771\">federal and state courts</a> have adjudicated abortion-related cases. There have been numerous legal challenges to the various state laws banning or restricting abortion, some failing and others succeeding at least temporarily.</p><p>There\u2019s a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-texas-exceptions-lawsuit-82611bda29112775247d8e7adbc0a81b\">pending lawsuit</a> in Texas filed by women who say the state\u2019s abortion ban forced them to continue pregnancies despite serious risk to their health.</p><p>In an even higher profile Texas case, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-texas-ban-7d865cdfd75bdc6b2f4186f4d1e6e8bd\">Kate Cox</a>, a mother of two, sought an abortion after learning the baby she was carrying had a fatal genetic condition. Her request for an exemption from Texas\u2019 ban \u2014 one of the country\u2019s strictest \u2014 was denied by the state Supreme Court, and Cox left Texas to seek an abortion elsewhere.</p><p>For abortion-rights activists, Cox\u2019s case was a powerful illustration of how abortion bans could be dangerous for women with pregnancy complications.</p><p>\u201cNever in our history have we had such overwhelming reaction to any case,\u201d said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights. \u201cWe got phone calls, emails, snail-mail. Over and over, people talked about her with awe, her courage in going public.\u201d</p><p>Seago, the Texas Right to Life president, defended Texas\u2019 abortion ban. He said the Cox case and the pending lawsuit simply underscored the need for Texas health authorities to clarify what doctors are and aren\u2019t allowed to do in dealing with problem pregnancies.</p><p>Carol Tobias acknowledged there can be difficult pregnancies.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t think hard circumstances should be used to establish state laws,\u201d she said. In such cases, she added, \u201cthe doctors have two patients. They need to take care of both of them to best of their ability.\u201d</p><p>All the new bans make an exception to allow abortion if deemed necessary to save the life of the mother. There are divides within the anti-abortion movement over additional exceptions \u2014 for example, in cases of rape and incest, or when severe fetal abnormalities are diagnosed.</p><p>Other divisions have surfaced over who should be criminalized by the new laws.</p><p>Among leading anti-abortion activists, there\u2019s a general consensus that women should not be prosecuted for seeking or obtaining an abortion. But there is support for criminal penalties against doctors and others who help people get an abortion; some states, including Texas and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/idaho-abortion-trafficking-travel-ban-270a403d7b4a5e99e566433556614728\">Idaho</a>, seek to deter people from traveling out of state to get abortions or obtaining abortion pills by mail.</p><p>Dr. Jamila Perritt, an abortion-rights supporter who is president of Physicians for Reproductive Health, worries that abortion opponents in states with bans will criminalize people who seek abortions outside the formal medical system.</p><p>\u201cThe impact of their campaign has been devastating \u2014 and it will get worse,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about many more people being arrested and prosecuted.\u201d</p><p>One of the biggest unknowns, heading toward to Election Day on Nov. 5, is how power in Washington will be divided between the two major parties.</p><p>Abortion-rights supporters fear a Republican sweep of Congress and the White House might trigger a bid to impose a federal abortion ban. Conversely, some abortion opponents \u2014 including Chris Smith \u2014 fear a Democratic sweep might lead to a law overriding the state abortion bans that are now in effect.</p><p>Such legislation \u2014 as modeled in the unsuccessful <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-bills-house-vote-fc24d99f184d7aeec4926a6520311da5\">Women\u2019s Health Protection Act</a> of 2021-22 \u2014 would be \u201can existential threat,\u201d Smith said.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-abortion-inflation-us-supreme-court-health-7ea4f8fa597c97042503d856a082ef94\">Sen. Lindsay Graham</a>, R-S.C., has introduced a bill proposing to ban most abortions nationwide after 15 weeks of gestation. SBA Pro-Life America, a prominent anti-abortion group, supports the bill, according to its state policy director, Katie Glenn Daniel. But the measure has vehement critics on both sides of the abortion divide.</p>",

While it does touch on health-related issues such as the risks to women's health due to abortion bans and the role of pregnancy care centers, the main emphasis is on the political and legal landscape rather than health itself. Therefore, it is somewhat relevant to the topic of health but not highly focused on it."
