The votes on Thursday quickly pushed forward Republican Senate President Kathleen Passidomo\u2019s top session priority. The bills would make it easier for foreign doctors and out-of-state health care workers to relocate to Florida. They also would create loan programs and other incentives to attract health care providers and services to underserved rural areas. The bills also seek to reduce demand at emergency rooms by strengthening hospitals\u2019 partnerships with nearby urgent care centers.",
