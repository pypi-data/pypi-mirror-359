Carney's office announced the postponement Thursday morning, hours before he was to speak to a joint session of the General Assembly. Officials provided few details in a statement. They said only that the 67-year-old Democrat has a fever and mild symptoms, but is in good spirits. A spokeswoman for the governor said Carney had tested negative for COVID-19. The State of the State Address will be rescheduled for a date yet to be determined. Carney is in the final year of his second term as governor.",
