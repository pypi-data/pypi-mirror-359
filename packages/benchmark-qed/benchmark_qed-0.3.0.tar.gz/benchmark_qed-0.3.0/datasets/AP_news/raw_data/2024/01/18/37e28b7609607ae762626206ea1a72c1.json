    "description_summary": "Missouri activists are throwing support behind a constitutional amendment to restore abortion rights while also allowing the procedure to be restricted in later stages of pregnancy. The group Missourians for Constitutional Freedom committed Thursday to an amendment that would let lawmakers restrict or ban abortions after fetal viability, except when needed to protect the health of the woman. The campaign had also considered a proposal without the option for viability laws. The announcement comes amid divisions within abortion-rights advocates over whether the procedure should be regulated after fetal viability. A competing Missouri amendment proposed by a Republican would allow abortions in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.",

(AP) \u2014 A Missouri abortion-rights campaign announced Thursday that it's throwing support behind an amendment to the state constitution that would enshrine access to the procedure while allowing restrictions in later stages of pregnancy.</p><p>Missourians for Constitutional Freedom said it is committing to a proposal, one of 11 versions, that would let lawmakers regulate or ban abortion after what's called <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-viability-ballot-initiatives-2024-roe-fcf440373973b01f740912cd3bbd98a4\">viability</a>, with an exception for the protection of the life and physical and mental health of the woman.</p><p>Supporters include the ACLU of Missouri, local Planned Parenthood affiliates and Abortion Action Missouri.</p><p>\u201cMissouri\u2019s cruel and restrictive ban on abortion is tying the hands of doctors and preventing necessary care,\u201d said Dr. Iman Alsaden, an adviser to Missourians for Constitutional Freedom and chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, in a statement. \u201cToday, Missourians are taking a critical step to make their own medical decisions and kick politicians out of the exam room.\u201d</p><p>The campaign faces steep opposition in its bid to get the proposal on November's ballot, with the petitions tied up in court for months <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/missouri-abortion-ballot-measure-wording-0821671b0292823fbabbb30f6cdf9824\">after being challenged</a> by Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft. Anti-abortion activities on Tuesday launched a campaign to quash any ballot initiative to amend the constitution aimed at bringing abortion back to the state.</p><p>Missourians for Constitutional Freedom has funding difficulties, ending 2023 with <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-election-missouri-4a42e99351ad6cc555fa4c61fe24ebe5\">no money in the bank</a>. Also complicating the effort is a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/missouri-abortion-rape-incest-cc4901ed9b9ec6a0ffc9d47e28ce1048\">competing ballot measure</a> by a Republican that would allow abortion up to 12 weeks, and after that only in cases of rape, incest and in medical emergencies up until fetal viability.</p><p>Missourians for Constitutional Freedom's announcement comes as abortion activists nationwide are divided over whether to support constitutional amendments that allow any regulation of abortion after viability.</p><p>The term is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. It\u2019s generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks into pregnancy but has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-technology-science-health-birmingham-7fc806f3c06aeae94c5d6ed1b06a6461\">shifted earlier</a> with medical advances. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/advocacy/facts-are-important/understanding-and-navigating-viability\">opposes viability language</a> in legislation or regulations.</p><p>Executive Director Pamela Merritt in a statement said Medical Students for Choice \u201cis deeply concerned by the trend of state coalitions organizing to enshrine restrictions on abortion access into state constitutions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCodifying the most problematic components of Roe is a tactic that completely rejects the reproductive justice framework, placing greater importance on the rights of some while sacrificing abortion access for people most impacted by abortion bans,\u201d Merritt said.</p><p>The decision by Missourians for Constitutional Freedom to include language on viability acknowledges concerns by some that a more expansive proposal would fail to pass in the state, which was among the first to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-us-supreme-court-missouri-government-and-politics-7bb5798bae32c3f15abad3a10941dfb5\">outlaw almost all abortions</a> after Roe v. Wade was overturned.</p><p>Current Missouri law includes an exception for medical emergencies, but not in cases of rape and incest.</p>",

It includes details about the proposal, the organizations supporting it, the opposition it faces, and the broader context of abortion laws and viability. While the primary focus is on the legal and political aspects of abortion rights, it also touches on health-related issues such as the impact of current abortion bans on medical care and the concept of fetal viability. Therefore, it is relevant to the topic of health, but not exclusively focused on health-related aspects."
