That's according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released Thursday. It found that over the course of a week, there was a 32% likelihood the tests would detect the presence of at least one person infected with mpox in a population ranging from thousands to millions. The testing is now a staple of COVID-19 tracking. And CDC is now using it for flu and RSV too. Soon, the agency plans to start watching for germs that are resistant to antibiotics and some food poisoning bugs.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Wastewater testing does a good job at detecting mpox infections, U.S. health officials said in a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7302a3.htm?s_cid=mm7302a3_w\">report</a> Thursday that bolsters a push to use sewage to track more diseases.</p><p>U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that over the course of a week, there was a 32% likelihood the tests would detect the presence of at least one person infected with mpox in a population ranging from thousands to millions.</p><p>Amy Kirby, who oversees the CDC\u2019s wastewater surveillance work, said initially they didn't know if the tests would work for a rare infection like mpox.</p><p>\"It turns out it worked really very well,\" she said.</p><p>The chance that the tests could detect infections rose as more people were infected. When there were 15 or more people infected in a community, there was a 76% chance wastewater testing could find mpox.</p><p>The water that goes down a sink, shower drain or toilet can carry bits of viruses or bacteria that come off the skin or are excreted in urine or poop. Studies have shown wastewater testing can be an early warning system, signaling a bug has hit a community even before doctors start reporting cases.</p><p>Whole cities can be watched from a single sample, said Joshua Levy, a researcher at the Scripps Research Institute in California who has studied wastewater monitoring and develops related technology.</p><p>\u201cAlmost every kind of virus that we've gone looking for is detectable,\u201d Levy said.</p><p>The U.S. monitoring system is growing but still a patchwork. Currently, 863 of the nation\u2019s 3,143 counties \u2014 roughly a quarter \u2014 are reporting wastewater data to the CDC. Those are larger counties that are home to most of the U.S. population, but it misses a lot of rural homes that aren't hooked up to municipal sewage systems.</p><p>This approach to disease tracking <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/334c8b4fcb5df44b25a058c724226d74\">rose to prominence</a> in 2020, when health officials began testing wastewater for genetic evidence of the coronavirus. It has grown into a mainstay of the CDC's <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#wastewater-surveillance\">COVID-19 tracking</a> as fewer nasal swab test results are reported.</p><p>In 2022, the CDC began working with a small group of cities to also look for polio in wastewater. That same year also saw a new effort to look for mpox, previously known as monkeypox, which erupted in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/monkeypox-public-health-emergency-us-f336fc99abd57f0866a38b578d5bb44c\">outbreaks</a> in the U.S. and other countries.</p><p>In the new study, the CDC looked at wastewater samples from 89 sites in 16 states, taken from August 2022 through May 2023. When mpox DNA was detected, the researchers checked cases reported by doctors \u201cto basically see if we were seeing the same thing,\u201d said the CDC\u2019s Carly Adams, the lead author of the report.</p><p>It not only worked, the approach appears to be more sensitive for detecting mpox than COVID-19, CDC officials said. CDC officials, however, cautioned it is difficult to do head-to-head-comparisons, because of differences among germs and how well doctors are diagnosing and reporting cases of various diseases.</p><p>The CDC has also begun collecting data for flu and RSV \u2014 about 40 states have been testing for those viruses and reporting that data. The agency isn't yet posting it publicly as officials work through the best ways to display it, though Kirby said it should go live by next fall.</p><p>The agency also plans to start tracking germs that are resistant to antibiotics. And Kirby said by early next year the agency would start monitoring some food poisoning bugs.</p><p>\u201cWastewater surveillance is outperforming everyone's expectations,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cWe are really excited to see where else we can apply this new tool to help us understand disease in communities.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
