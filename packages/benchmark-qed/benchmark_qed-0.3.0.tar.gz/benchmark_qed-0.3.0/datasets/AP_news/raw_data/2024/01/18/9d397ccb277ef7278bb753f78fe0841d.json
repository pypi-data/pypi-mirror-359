On track to surpass George Szell as Cleveland\u2019s longest-tenured music director, the 63-year-old Austrian returned to his orchestra at Cleveland\u2019s Severance Music Center last week and leads it in a pair of programs at Carnegie Hall this weekend. He had a slipped disk in his neck in June, surgery Sept. 1 to remove a cancerous tumor from his bladder and a second operation on Oct. 25. That was followed in November by six weeks of once-a-week immunotherapy treatment.",

You learn to live with the circumstances, and I'm extremely and grateful that I'm back at work.\u201d</p><p>On track to surpass George Szell as Cleveland's longest-tenured music director, the 63-year-old Austrian returned to his orchestra at Cleveland's Severance Music Center last week and leads it in a pair of programs at Carnegie Hall this weekend. He will be in Austria for five concerts with the Vienna Philharmonic in late February, then leads that orchestra on a seven-concert tour in early March to New York and Naples and West Palm Beach, Florida.</p><p>Quite a schedule, given his setbacks in 2023.</p><p>He had a slipped disk in his neck while conducting Wagner's four-opera \u201cDer Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung)\u201d at the Vienna State Opera in June, an injury that caused him to enter an orthopedic clinic in the second half of July and again in August. He was forced to cancel a high-profile new production of Verdi's \u201cMacbeth\u201d at the Salzburg Festival.</p><p>Welser-M\u00f6st had surgery Sept. 1 to remove a cancerous tumor from his bladder and came back to Cleveland to conduct the orchestra's season opener on Sept. 28. After leading two weeks of programs there, he took the orchestra to Vienna and Linz for their 21st international tour together, then had a second operation on Oct. 25.</p><p>That was followed in November by six weeks of once-a-week immunotherapy treatment. He is scheduled for additional three-week cycles of treatment in March, July and October.</p><p>\u201cThe doctors are very happy. So am I, that it seems to work. It has been in my family, so it\u2019s genetic,\u201d Welser-M\u00f6st said. \u201cBoth my brothers had the same thing a couple of years ago. Both are very well now, so there\u2019s every reason to be optimistic.\u201d</p><p>Welser-M\u00f6st has been Cleveland's music director since 2002-03 and has appointed 69 musicians, including 52 of the current 105 members.</p><p>\u201cOne of the keys to Franz's success is his incredible discipline. He's like a great athlete in that way,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 Gremillet, the Cleveland Orchestra\u2019s president and CEO. \u201cHe\u2019s very focused, very disciplined in the way he approaches everything, and I think that has served him well also in facing his health challenges.\u201d</p><p>His name at birth in Linz, Austria, was Franz Leopold Maria M\u00f6st, and he switched it in 1985 to Welser-M\u00f6st in honor of Wels, a nearby city he grew up in. The change was made on the advice of a benefactor, Baron Andreas von Bennigsen of Liechtenstein.</p><p>Welser-M\u00f6st spent a decade studying the technique of Herbert von Karajan, the Berlin Philharmonic\u2019s chief conductor from 1954-89. He was 19 when he was brought to Karajan in 1979 by Albert Moser, then general director of Vienna\u2019s Musikverein. Welser-M\u00f6st was among the 10 finalists of the Karajan International Conductors Competition, though he failed to win.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d been to a lot of rehearsals in Vienna, in Salzburg and Berlin, and that made a huge impression on me because Karajan was highly efficient in rehearsals,\u201d Welser-M\u00f6st recalled. \u201cHe would just say one sentence and the sound of the orchestra changed completely. And in those days, of course, I was like: How on earth is he doing that?\u201d</p><p>Welser-M\u00f6st first conducted the Cleveland Orchestra in 1993 and became music director for the 2002-03 season. On the afternoon of his return concert on Jan. 11, he announced he will retire as music director at the end of 2026-27, his 25th season. Welser-M\u00f6st maintained he wasn't focused on topping Szell's reign, which stretched from 1946-70.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not into that game. It just happened,\u201d he said.</p><p>Welser-M\u00f6st's New York concerts are part of Carnegie Hall's \u201cPerspectives\u201d series and its focus this winter and spring on the fall of the Weimar Republic.</p><p>\u201cIt is something that is so important to him and so important to his life,\u201d Carnegie Hall executive director Clive Gillinson said. \u201cI remember doing one Zoom call where he was in his library and he showed me all the books he's got on Weimar.\u201d</p><p>Welser-M\u00f6st is proud of extending the orchestra's flexibility by programming semi-staged operas, with Mozart's \"Die Zauberfl\u00f6te (The Magic Flute)\" next this May. He already has scheduled Jan\u00e1\u010dek's \u201cJen\u016ffa\u201d for next season, Beethoven's \u201cFidelio\u201d for 2025-26 and Strauss' \u201cDie Frau ohne Schatten (The Woman without a Shadow)\u201d for 2026-27.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an old dog when it comes to opera,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve conducted about 90 different operas in my life. When I was in Zurich for nearly 14 years, I conducted 43 opening nights of a piece.\u201d</p><p>His retirement creates another coveted U.S. podium vacancy. Riccardo Muti stepped down from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in June and Gustavo Dudamel shifts from the Los Angeles Philharmonic to the New York Philharmonic for the 2026-27 season.</p><p>\u201cEvery institution needs once in a while new input and new ideas,\u201d Welser-M\u00f6st said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I'm running out of ideas, but I always tried to live that philosophy here, that music comes first, the institution second, the individual third.\u201d</p>",
