The state health department said Wednesday that Jeanette Breen knowingly gave children the pellets and falsified their immunization records. Health officials say the children\u2019s vaccine records have been voided. Their families must prove the students are up-to-date with their required shots or in the process of getting them before returning to school. Breen's lawyer says his client cooperated with investigators, paid her fine and intends to comply with all other requirements of her agreement with health officials.",

In 2019, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cdab615894c24163a7947d67c6874f2f\">New York ended</a> a religious exemption to vaccine requirements for schoolchildren.</p><p>The health department said immunization records of the children who received the falsified records have been voided, and their families must now prove the students are up-to-date with their required shots or at least in the process of getting them before they can return to school.</p><p>\u201cMisrepresenting or falsifying vaccine records puts lives in jeopardy and undermines the system that exists to protect public health,\u201d State Health Commissioner James McDonald said in a statement.</p><p>Breen, a state-licensed healthcare provider, supplied patients with the \u201cReal Immunity Homeoprophylaxis Program,\u201d a series of oral pellets that are marketed as an alternative to vaccination but are not recognized or approved by state or federal regulators as valid immunizations, according to the health department.</p><p>She administered 12,449 of the fake immunizations to roughly 1,500 school-aged patients before submitting information to the state's immunization database claiming the children had received their required vaccinations against measles, mumps, rubella, polio, chickenpox, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and a host of other diseases, the department said.</p><p>Breen's lawyer said Thursday that his client cooperated with investigators, paid her fine and intends to comply with all other requirements of her agreement with health officials.</p><p>\u201cSuffice it to say, Ms. Breen has provided excellent midwifery services for many years to many families, especially on Long Island. She is now toward the end of her career,\u201d David Eskew wrote in an emailed statement. \u201cFrom her perspective, this matter is over, done with, and closed and she is now moving on with her life.\u201d</p><p>As part of the settlement, Breen has paid $150,000 of the $300,000 penalty, with the remainder suspended contingent upon her complying with state health laws and never again administering any immunization that must be reported to the state, according to the health department. She's also permanently banned from accessing the state's immunization records system.</p><p>Erin Clary, a health department spokesperson, said Thursday that while parents and legal guardians had sought out and paid Breen for her services, they weren't the focus of the agency\u2019s investigation.</p><p>State health officials say they're now in the process of notifying hundreds of affected school districts.</p>",
