    "description_summary": "The double health announcements from Britain\u2019s royal family have put a spotlight on the private lives of the U.K.\u2018s senior royals. Officials say the Princess of Wales has had abdominal surgery, while King Charles III is to have prostate treatment. Details of royal health are always a tricky issue in Britain, because members of the royal family are private individuals but also, in a sense, public property. Charles is head of state, and Kate is destined to be queen when her husband Prince William succeeds his father on the throne. Some royal observers saw the announcements as a sign that the monarchy is adapting to modern communications after centuries of staying tight-lipped about health matters.",

Charles, 75, is head of state, and Kate, 42, is destined to be queen when her husband <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/prince-william\">Prince William</a> succeeds his father on the throne.</p><p>The brief media statements on the health scares were so unusual that they dominated Thursday\u2019s newspaper front pages, with headlines calling them \u201croyal health bombshells.\u201d</p><p>The disclosure of Charles' and Kate's health details was seen by some royal observers as a sign that the monarchy is adapting to modern communications after centuries of staying tight-lipped about health matters.</p><hl2>WHAT WAS ANNOUNCED?</hl2><p>Royal officials announced Wednesday that Kate had undergone \u201cplanned\u201d abdominal surgery and was expected to remain in The London Clinic, a private hospital, for 10 to 14 days. She isn't expected to resume public duties until April.</p><p>The princess\u2019 office at Kensington Palace didn\u2019t offer further details, but said that her condition wasn\u2019t cancerous. Though she has generally experienced good health and is seen as fit and sporty, Kate was hospitalized during her pregnancies because of severe morning sickness.</p><p>William also has postponed some official duties so that he can devote time to his wife and their three children. He visited his wife on Thursday, and British media reported that the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/kate-middleton\">Princess of Wales</a> was \u201cdoing well.\u201d</p><p>Soon after the announcement of Kate\u2019s hospitalization, Buckingham Palace said that Charles will undergo a \u201ccorrective procedure\u201d for an enlarged prostate next week. The palace said the king\u2019s condition is benign. Queen Camilla said Thursday that Charles was \u201cfine\u201d and \u201clooking forward to getting back to work.\u201d</p><hl2>A HISTORY OF SECRECY</hl2><p>When U.K. monarchs had real power, news of illness was withheld for fear it might weaken their authority. The habit of secrecy lingered after royals became constitutional figureheads.</p><p>The British public wasn't told that Charles' grandfather, King George VI, had lung cancer before his death in February 1952 at the age of 56, and some historians have claimed that the king himself wasn't told he was terminally ill. The public death announcement said only that the king had \u201cpassed peacefully away in his sleep.\u201d</p><p>His father, King George V, died in 1936 after suffering from heart and lung disease. A half-century later, diary extracts were published revealing that the king\u2019s physician had injected the terminally ill monarch with morphine and cocaine to speed his death \u2014 partly so it could be announced in the morning newspapers \u201crather than the less appropriate evening journals.\u201d</p><hl2>GREATER OPENNESS?</hl2><p>The U.K. and international media have been focused on the health of Britain\u2019s senior royals in recent years as the late Queen Elizabeth II faded from public view during the last months of her 70-year reign.</p><p>Even then, few specific details were released about the late monarch\u2019s condition. The public was told only that the queen was suffering from \u201cmobility issues.\u201d The cause of her death in September 2022 at the age of 96 was listed on the death certificate simply as \u201cold age.\u201d</p><p>Wednesday's announcements gave more details than the public would have expected in the past.</p><p>Some royal experts said that while the latest statement on Kate was coy and shrouded in some secrecy, the one on Charles showed that the monarch was keen to try a new and more open kind of communication.</p><p>The publicity was seen as a decision by Charles to help boost awareness of prostate health, and encourage other men to have their prostates checked.</p><p>\u201cI think it symbolizes the kind of campaigning king that Charles is \u2014 he wants to put this issue on the agenda by being quite open and candid,\u201d Ed Owens, a royal historian and author, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe know that King Charles wants to talk about issues of personal significance \u2014 and there's nothing more significant or personal to him than his health.\u201d</p><p>Releasing the news about both royals on the same day was also about news management, Owens added. While Kate's condition sounded more serious, the king's can be seen as a \u201cpositive news story to complement a more complicated one in the case of Catherine's health,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt means that we haven\u2019t got the story rolling on about what exactly (Kate's) been suffering from. Rather, we are instead talking about King Charles III and him wanting to set a good example to other men his age,\u201d Owens said.</p><hl2>\u2018KING\u2019S PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGE'</hl2><p>One headline dubbed the release of Charles\u2019 health details the \u201cKing\u2019s public health message.\u201d It's worked: Prostate Cancer UK, a charity that promotes public awareness of prostate health, says there has been a surge of interest in its work thanks to the royal announcements.</p><p>\u201cWe have been receiving lots of calls from men and women that are concerned about them and their loved ones, wanting to talk about their prostate problems and signs and symptoms,\u201d said Sophie Smith, a senior specialist nurse at the charity.</p><p>An enlarged prostate is common in men over age 50. The condition affects how one urinates, and isn\u2019t usually a serious health threat. It\u2019s not cancer and doesn\u2019t lead to an increased risk of developing prostate cancer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about getting that conversation started,\" Smith added. \u201cWe know that men often don\u2019t talk about it, they don\u2019t sit with their mates and say, \u2018I\u2019ve getting problems going to the toilet.\u2019 It\u2019s something quite personal, a bit taboo.\u201d</p><hl2>WIDER IMPLICATIONS</hl2><p>While Charles's condition wasn't worrying, the announcements that the monarch, Kate and William would all be out of action in one way or another in the coming days did lead to larger questions about what happens to matters of state in more serious cases.</p><p>This is especially of interest because Charles presides over a much more \u201cslimmed-down\u201d monarchy than his predecessors, with just four royals under 65 years old: William, Kate, Charles's younger brother Prince Edward and his wife Sophie.</p><p>When monarchs can't undertake their duties on a temporary basis, \u201cCounsellors of State,\u201d who include senior royals like Queen Camilla and Prince Harry, can stand in and deputize if needed.</p><p>\u201cIt points to a fundamental question \u2014 how does the king get the monarchy ready for the middle of the 21st century with this smaller family in tow?\" Owens said. \u201cI think it points to the fact that he has to reduce the amount of engagements, the amount of work that is being undertaken by this family.\u201d</p>",
