    "description_summary": "President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are highlighting the battle over abortion rights. Harris will visit Wisconsin on Monday, which would've been the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Harris and Biden will hold a joint campaign event with first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff on Tuesday in Virginia. Democrats believe abortion will be a potent political weapon against likely Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who as president appointed three conservative justices to the Supreme Court before it overturned Roe. Biden's team also is preparing ads focused on abortion rights. Political allies including Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper are hosting their own events.",

While abortion rights are a health-related topic, the document's main emphasis is on the political implications and campaign strategies rather than on health itself.
