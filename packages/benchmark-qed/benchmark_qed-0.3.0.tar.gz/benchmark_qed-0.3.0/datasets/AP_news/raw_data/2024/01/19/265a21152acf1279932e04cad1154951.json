Jaci Statton filed a complaint with the department last year under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. Doctors had told her that she had a partial molar pregnancy but could not give her an abortion until she was closer to death. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told Statton that it could not \u201cconfirm a violation\u201d of the emergency care federal law after conducting an investigation.",

The complaint came a little more than a year after Biden's administration informed <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-government-and-politics-4221f9306a596904b9af2e0d1fad23b9\">hospitals that they must provide abortion services</a> if the mother\u2019s life is at risk. At the time, President Joe Biden's administration said EMTALA supersedes state abortion bans that don\u2019t have adequate exceptions for medical emergencies.</p><p>The Biden administration\u2019s denial of Statton\u2019s claim is the latest development in the ongoing scrutiny over <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-idaho-government-and-politics-7c316e07d0889ec5f9c9657a4da2a1d3\">how to apply EMTALA</a> in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade. It also underscores the uphill legal battle reproductive rights advocates when pushing back against state abortion bans.</p><p>According to the complaint, Statton learned she was pregnant in early 2023 and soon began experiencing severe pain and nausea. Doctors in Oklahoma eventually told her that she had a partial molar pregnancy, which left untreated could cause hemorrhaging, infection, and even death.</p><p>\u201cHowever, providers told Jaci that they could not provide an abortion until she was actively crashing in front of them or on the verge of a heart attack,\" the complaint stated. \"In the meantime, the best that they could offer was to let Jaci sit in the parking lot so that she would be close to the hospital when her condition further deteriorated.\u201d</p><p>Abortion is illegal in almost every case in Oklahoma. However, in November, the state's Supreme Court reiterated in a ruling that the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/oklahoma-supreme-court-abortion-8e6160880139b86d654dd0531831e945\">state constitution guarantees a woman\u2019s right</a> to an abortion when necessary to preserve her life.</p><p>Ultimately, Statton and her husband traveled out of state to have an emergency abortion rather than wait for her health to deteriorate.</p><p>In October, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \u2014 which operates under Health and Human Services \u2014 informed Statton that its investigation could not \u201cconfirm a violation\u201d of the emergency care federal law.</p><p>\u201cWe appreciate you bringing this matter to our attention,\u201d the letter said.</p><p>The Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents Statton, confirmed Friday that her complaint had been denied. The center did not disclose why it waited months to make the denial public. In December, an attorney for the center told The Associated Press that they had did not have any updates that they could release publicly.</p><p>\u201cEMTALA was created to protect every person\u2019s right to receive stabilizing treatment for an emergency medical condition no matter which state they live in or what kind of stabilizing care they need,\u201d said Rabia Muqaddam, a senior staff attorney with the center. \u201cIt is horrifying that patients in Jaci\u2019s circumstances are being turned away.\u201d</p><p>A spokesperson for Health and Human Services did not immediately return an email request for comment.</p><p>The Center for Reproductive Rights has lawsuits ongoing in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ban-lawsuits-idaho-tennessee-oklahoma-39257646d84255feff5a82f401f32b79\">Idaho, Tennessee and Texas</a>. The lawsuits do not seek to overturn the states\u2019 abortion bans, but instead ask the state courts to clarify the circumstances that qualify patients to legally receive an abortion.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court\">Supreme Court</a> earlier this month allowed Idaho to enforce its strict abortion ban, even in medical emergencies, while a separate legal fight continues. The justices said they would hear arguments in April and put on hold a lower court ruling that had blocked the Idaho law in hospital emergencies, based on a federal lawsuit filed by the Biden administration.</p><p>Also this month, a three-judge panel in New Orleans ruled that the administration cannot use EMTALA to require hospitals in Texas to provide abortions for women whose lives are at risk due to pregnancy.</p>",
