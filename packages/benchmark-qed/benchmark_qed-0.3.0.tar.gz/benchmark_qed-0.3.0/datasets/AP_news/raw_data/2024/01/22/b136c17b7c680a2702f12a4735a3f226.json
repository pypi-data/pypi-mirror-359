The 1973 ruling established the right to abortion across the U.S. But things have been in flux since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned it in 2022. Measures to protect abortion access will be on the ballots this year in at least two states \u2014 and are under consideration in a dozen more. Activists used Monday for legislative hearings and campaign launches. Legal questions about when exceptions apply in states with bans are playing out in federal agencies and courts.",

A cardboard sign read, \u201cSomeone you love has had an abortion,\u201d as state lawmakers and the Colorado attorney general bunched around a microphone and the crowd cheered.</p><p>Colorado\u2019s legislature passed abortion protections last year, but \u201cif we don\u2019t enshrine it in the constitution, we will be at the whim of lawmakers,\u201d said Nicole Hensel, executive director of New Era Colorado, one of the coalition of groups behind the Coloradans for Protecting Reproductive Freedom campaign.</p><p>Colorado has become an island of abortion protections as surrounding states installed restrictions after Roe was overturned. The Cobalt Abortion Fund based in Colorado spent six times the amount helping people get abortions in 2023 as they did in 2021.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-protections-maryland-constitution-8457276fd72fbe1367f7f8a99559731b\">Advocates in Maryland</a> also used Monday's Roe v. Wade anniversary to begin their campaign to support the ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution that's already on the ballot there for November.</p><p>The only other state where a statewide vote on abortion rights in 2024 is sure to happen is <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-us-supreme-court-politics-womens-rights-new-york-5ae2968ab80098246978af10765ed9ae\">New York</a>, where the proposed amendment includes protecting reproductive freedom.</p><p>But similar votes are under consideration in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ballot-measure-2024-state-vote-e7d635835dc3a440789ad87787553ec1\">more than a dozen states</a>.</p><p>Since 2022, abortion rights supporters have prevailed on all <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ohio-abortion-amendment-election-2023-fe3e06747b616507d8ca21ea26485270\">seven statewide ballot measures</a>.</p><hl2>LAWMAKERS IN WISCONSIN, MAINE CONSIDER BALLOT MEASURES</hl2><p>Lawmakers in two states scheduled hearings for Monday as first steps to ask voters to change abortion policy.

To reach that, several Republicans would have to vote in favor of asking the public to vote.</p><p>In Wisconsin, a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-abortion-14-weeks-bill-referendum-b30271e482ffab0b19f50797bde6062c\">GOP proposal would ban abortion after 14 weeks</a> of pregnancy.</p><p>Republicans control the legislature there, but Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, would likely veto the measure if it passed.</p><p>Currently, abortion is available in Wisconsin until fetal viability, but there's litigation over whether an <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ban-wisconsin-dane-county-judge-ruling-b9992fc2a162bc4b5201936a69d00eec\">1849 law that conservatives interpreted as banning abortion</a> should apply.</p><hl2>MISSOURI ACTIVISTS CHOOSE AN AMENDMENT TO SUPPORT</hl2><p>A <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-missouri-constitutional-amendment-viability-37e28b7609607ae762626206ea1a72c1\">coalition of abortion rights supporters</a> in Missouri decided last week which of 11 amendment proposals to support.</p><p>They went with one that would allow lawmakers to restrict abortion access only after viability \u2014 generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks gestation age \u2014 when a fetus might survive outside the uterus.</p><p>The decision from groups including the state ACLU chapter and Planned Parenthood chapters is one solution to a debate advocates have been having on whether to support measures that allow some abortion restrictions.</p><p>The Missouri measure would allow abortion later in pregnancy to protect the life and physical and mental health of the woman.</p><p>Some moderate Republicans are <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/missouri-abortion-rape-incest-cc4901ed9b9ec6a0ffc9d47e28ce1048\">pushing a competing amendment</a>, which would allow abortion up to 12 weeks in most cases, and between then and viability only in pregnancies resulting from rape or incest or in medical emergencies.</p><p>Under Missouri law, abortion is banned at all stages of pregnancy, with an exception to protect the life of the woman \u2014 but not in cases of rape or incest.</p><hl2></hl2><hl2>BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SIDES WITH OKLAHOMA HOSPITAL</hl2><p>In a decision made in October but not revealed publicly until last week, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that an Oklahoma <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-oklahoma-ban-medical-emergencies-265a21152acf1279932e04cad1154951\">hospital did not violate federal law</a> when doctors told a woman with a nonviable pregnancy to wait in a parking lot until her condition declined enough for her to qualify for an abortion under the state's strict ban.</p><p>The ruling was the latest in what's emerged as a major legal question as most Republican-controlled states have imposed abortion bans: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-exception-lawsuit-legislature-confusion-b2808df90937e96887aa4e1f9c565771\">When do exceptions apply?</a></p><p>In other situations, the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/emergency-abortion-law-hospitals-kansas-missouri-emtala-2f993d2869fa801921d7e56e95787567\">same federal agency</a> has maintained that hospitals would violate federal law by turning away women seeking an abortion amid medical emergencies.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ban-lawsuits-idaho-tennessee-oklahoma-39257646d84255feff5a82f401f32b79\">Pending lawsuits</a> from women who assert they were wrongly denied an abortion address the issue.</p><p>Even as the Biden administration ruled in favor of the hospital in the Oklahoma case, it's planning to help people file complaints under the law that\u2019s intended to ensure emergency health care access.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press/Report for America reporters Trisha Ahmed in Minneapolis and Jesse Bedayn in Denver contributed to this article.</p>",
