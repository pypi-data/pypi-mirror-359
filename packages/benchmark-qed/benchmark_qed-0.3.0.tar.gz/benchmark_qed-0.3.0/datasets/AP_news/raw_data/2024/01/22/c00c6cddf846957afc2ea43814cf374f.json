The Taliban have banned women from education, most jobs and public spaces since seizing control of Afghanistan in 2021. In its latest quarterly report published Monday, the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said the Taliban's Vice and Virtue Ministry is setting up checkpoints and monitoring women's compliance with dress codes and mahrams. The Taliban's chief spokesman said the report was based on misunderstandings and accused the mission of ignoring or criticizing Islamic law.",

In May 2022, the Taliban issued a decree calling for women to only show their eyes and recommending they wear the head-to-toe burqa, similar to restrictions during the Taliban\u2019s previous rule between 1996 and 2001.</p><p>The U.N. spokesman, asked for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' reaction to the latest bans, replied: \u201cHorror!\u201d Stephane Dujarric added: \u201cIt must be unimaginable to have to live through it.\"</p><p>In its latest quarterly report, covering October to December last year, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said the Taliban are cracking down on Afghan women who are single or don't have a male guardian, or mahram, accompanying them.</p><p>There are no official laws about male guardianship in Afghanistan, but the Taliban have said women cannot move around or travel a certain distance without a man who is related to her by blood or marriage.</p><p>Three female health care workers were detained last October because they were going to work without a mahram. They were released after their families signed a written guarantee that they would not repeat the act, the report said.</p><p>In Paktia province, the Vice and Virtue Ministry has stopped women without mahrams from accessing health facilities since December. It visits health facilities in the province to ensure compliance.</p><p>The ministry, which serves as the Taliban's <a href=\"morality police\">morality police</a>, is also enforcing hijab and mahram requirements when women visit public places, offices and education institutes through checkpoints and inspections.</p><p>In December, in Kandahar province, ministry officials visited a bus terminal to ensure women were not traveling long distances without mahrams and instructed bus drivers not to permit women to board without one, the U.N. said.</p><p>Women have also been arrested for buying contraceptives, which the Taliban have not officially banned.</p><p>The Taliban\u2019s chief spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said the U.N. report was based mostly on misunderstandings and accused the mission of ignoring or criticizing Islamic law, or Shariah.</p><p>With an Islamic government in power in Afghanistan, it must \"fully implement all aspects of Shariah for both men and women,\u201d Mujahid said in a statement.</p><p>This means enforcing rules for the hijab, male guardianship and gender segregation for women in education and employment, he said.</p><p>\"If UNAMA criticizes these cases or considers explicit Islamic rulings as an act against human rights, then it is an insult to the beliefs of a people,\u201d he said.</p>",
