    "description_summary": "President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have joined forces at a rally in Virginia as they push for abortion rights. First lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff were also there Tuesday at what was the first joint appearance by all four of them since the 2024 campaign began. It's a reflection of the importance that Democrats are placing on abortion as they face a likely rematch against Donald Trump, the former Republican president. Trump helped pave the way for overturning Roe v. Wade by nominating three conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, a fact that the Biden campaign plans to remind voters of at every opportunity.",

(AP) \u2014 President <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/joe-biden\">Joe Biden</a> on Tuesday condemned abortion bans that have increasingly endangered the health of pregnant women, forcing them to grow sicker before they can receive medical care, and he laid the blame on <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</a>, his likely Republican challenger in this year's election.</p><p>\u201cHe's betting we won't hold him responsible,\u201d Biden said to a crowd of hundreds of cheering supporters. \u201cHe's betting you're going to stop caring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut guess what?\u201d he added. \u201cI'm betting he's wrong. I'm betting you won't forget.\"</p><p>The rally with Vice President <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a> came on the same day as the Republican primary in New Hampshire, where Trump tightened his grip on his party's presidential nomination. Biden won the largely symbolic Democratic primary via a write-in campaign after he refused to appear on the ballot.</p><p>The Virginia rally demonstrated how Democrats hope to harness enduring anger over abortion restrictions to blunt his comeback bid.</p><p>Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court less than two years ago in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, a decision enabled by three conservative justices appointed by Trump.</p><p>\u201cThe person most responsible for taking away this freedom in America is Donald Trump,\" Biden said.</p><p>The speech was Biden's bluntest yet on abortion and the status of reproductive health, but it was disrupted several times by protests over Israel's war in Gaza. One person shouted \u201cshame on you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is going to go on for a while; they got this planned,\u201d the Democratic president said as the protestors were escorted out one by one.</p><p>Biden and Harris were joined by their spouses, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff, at Tuesday's rally. It\u2019s the first time the four of them have appeared together since the campaign began, a reflection of the importance that Democrats are putting on abortion this year.</p><p>Jill Biden told a story about a friend who became pregnant in high school, years before Roe v. Wade. The friend, she said, needed to get a psychiatric evaluation to be declared mentally unfit before she could get the abortion.</p><p>\u201cSecrecy, shame, silence, danger, even death. That's what defined that time for so many women,\" she said. \u201cAnd because of Dobbs that\u2019s where we\u2019re finding ourselves back again, refighting the battles we had fought.\"</p><p>Emhoff told the crowd that the fight for abortion rights needed men as well.</p><p>\u201cReproductive freedom is not a woman\u2019s issue,\u201d Emhoff said. \u201cIt\u2019s an everyone\u2019s issue.\u201d</p><p>The four of them spoke in front of a blue banner that spanned the width of the stage and said \u201cRestore Roe\u201d in bold letters. The crowd hummed with energy, chanting \u201cfour more years\u201d and booing Trump's name, a glimpse of the enthusiasm that has been largely missing from Biden's low-key events since <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-election-2024-president-democrats-trump-9c72115656855da89a41cac3f79aa65b#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20(AP)%20%E2%80%94%20President%20Joe,president%20for%20another%20four%20years.\">announcing his reelection campaign</a> last April.</p><p>Biden was introduced by Amanda Zurawski, a Texas woman whose water broke only halfway through her pregnancy. Because Roe v. Wade had just been overturned, she was unable to get an abortion until she went into septic shock.</p><p>\u201cWhat I went through was nothing short of barbaric. And it didn\u2019t need to happen,\" said Zurawski, who has also testified before Congress and sued Texas along with several other women. \"But it did, because of Donald Trump.\u201d</p><p>Democrats view Virginia as a success story in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/virginia-abortion-battleground-state-cea29fcf164f639219a1908a7ea32bba\">their fight for abortion rights</a> since Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. In last year\u2019s legislative elections, the party maintained control of the Senate and won a majority in the House. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/youngkin-virginia-president-elections-2024-trump-republicans-0b9ad289fe245c2968cfebd8cfe7b2b4\">It was a defeat</a> for Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who had proposed new limits on abortion and had been considered a potential presidential candidate.</p><p>\u201cThe voice of the people has been heard and it will be heard,\u201d said Harris, the first woman to serve as vice president.</p><p>She also targeted Trump in her speech, describing him as \u201cthe architect of this health care crisis\u201d caused by abortion restrictions around the country.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-abortion-biden-2024-election-560bc2bbdf036c18b6601ced44a62b50\">Harris was in Wisconsin on Monday</a> to mark the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the first stop in a nationwide series of events focused on abortion.</p><p>\u201cIn America, freedom is not to be given. It is not to be bestowed. It is ours by right,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that includes the freedom to make decisions about one\u2019s own body \u2014 not the government telling you what to do.\u201d</p><p>While Harris and Democrats have embraced abortion as a campaign issue, many Republicans are shying away or calling for a truce, fearful of sparking more backlash from voters.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/nikki-haley\">Nikki Haley</a>, the former South Carolina governor who is running for the Republican presidential nomination, recently made a plea to \u201cfind consensus\u201d on the divisive issue.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I\u2019m pro-life, I don\u2019t judge anyone for being pro-choice, and I don\u2019t want them to judge me for being pro-life,\u201d she said during a primary debate in November.</p><p>Trump has taken credit for helping to overturn Roe v. Wade, but he has balked at laws like Florida\u2019s ban on abortions after six weeks, which was signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ron-desantis-250c8ed4b49843350e258f0c2754c8ba\">who dropped out of the Republican nomination race</a> over the weekend.</p><p>\u201cYou have to win elections,\u201d Trump said during a recent Fox News town hall.</p><p>Abortion is also the focus of Biden's new television advertisement featuring Dr. Austin Dennard, an OB-GYN in Texas who had to leave her state to get an abortion when she learned that her baby had a fatal condition called anencephaly.</p><p>\u201cIn Texas, you are forced to carry that pregnancy, and that is because of Donald Trump overturning Roe v. Wade,\u201d Dennard said.</p><p>Although Democrats want to restore the federal rights that were established in Roe v. Wade, there's no chance of that with the current makeup of the Supreme Court and Republican control of the House. The White House is pushing against the limits of its ability to ensure access to abortion.</p><p>On Monday, it announced the creation of a team dedicated to helping hospitals comply with the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which requires hospitals receiving federal money to provide life-saving treatment when a patient is at risk of dying.</p><p>The Department of Health and Human Services said it would improve training at hospitals concerning the law and publish new information on how to lodge a complaint against a hospital.</p><p>Some advocacy groups have said complaints should be enforced more aggressively. Last week, The Associated Press <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-oklahoma-ban-medical-emergencies-265a21152acf1279932e04cad1154951\">reported</a> that federal officials did not find any violation of the law when an Oklahoma hospital instructed a 26-year-old woman to wait in a parking lot until her condition worsened to qualify for an abortion of her nonviable pregnancy.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Amanda Seitz contributed to this report.</p>",

While the topic of abortion does intersect with health, the document is more centered on political discourse, campaign strategies, and the impact of abortion laws on elections. The health aspect is mentioned but not deeply explored. Therefore, the document is somewhat relevant to the topic of health but not highly focused on it."
