Hennepin Healthcare said in a statement that it doesn't comment on pending litigation.</p><p>It all started on July 18, 2022, when Lucas Bellamy was arrested on charges of fleeing police in a suspected stolen vehicle and possession of brass knuckles, The Minneapolis Star Tribune <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/louis-bellamy-penumbra-theatres-founder-sues-hcmc-and-the-county-over-his-sons-death-in-jail/600337839/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=talkers&refresh=true\">reports</a>.</p><p>During jail intake, he told staff that he had ingested a bag of drugs and was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center, known as HCMC, the suit said. He was monitored and returned to jail with instructions to return to the emergency department if he exhibited any concerning symptoms.</p><p>The Bellamy family\u2019s attorney, Jeff Storms, showed the news media video of Lucas\u2019 interactions with nurses and jail guards. The last clip revealed him just behind his cell door, the lower half of his body slowly moving about until he went still and died.</p><p>His father, Louis Bellamy, who is a director and founded the Penumbra Theatre in St. Paul, said in a briefing that he has seen tragedy on the stage. But he noted he \u201ccould not have built anything more callous, more disrespectful to \u2026 humanity, human existence than what I witnessed on that tape.\u201d</p><p>The lawsuit alleges that Bellamy\u2019s death was among 15 at the jail since 2015, including eight within the past two years. It alleges that checks on inmate well-being have fallen short of standards, and such was the case with Bellamy.</p><p>Storms, the attorney, said he is calling on Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to investigate.</p><p>\u201cLucas could have been saved with proper treatment,\u201d the suit said. \u201cInstead, he endured a real-life nightmare and died.\u201d</p>",

While the document does touch on health-related issues, such as the man's medical condition and the alleged neglect of his health needs by jail staff, the main focus is on the legal and human rights aspects of the case rather than health itself. Therefore, it is somewhat relevant to the topic of health but not highly focused on it."
