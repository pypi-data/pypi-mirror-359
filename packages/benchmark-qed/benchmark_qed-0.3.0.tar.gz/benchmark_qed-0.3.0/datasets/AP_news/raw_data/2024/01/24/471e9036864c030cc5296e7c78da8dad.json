Carson City District Judge James T. Russell made the ruling Tuesday. A ballot question that could enshrine abortion access into the state constitution for up to 24 weeks \u2014 or as needed to protect the health of the pregnant patient \u2014 would appear on the 2024 general election ballot with enough signatures. Voters would need to pass again on the 2026 ballot for those rights to be enshrined.",

(AP) \u2014 A Nevada judge has approved a petition by abortion access advocates as eligible for signature gathering in their long-standing attempt to get abortion rights on the 2024 ballot.</p><p>Carson City District Judge James T. Russell made the ruling Tuesday, about two months after he <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-nevada-reproductive-freedom-bfaaacb4832115da76b6eb45882f60aa\">struck down a similar yet broader version</a> that, if passed, would have enshrined additional reproductive rights into the state\u2019s constitution.</p><p>If the Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom political action committee gets enough signatures, a question would appear on the November ballot that would enshrine abortion access into the Nevada constitution for up to 24 weeks, or as needed to protect the health of the pregnant patient. Then, voters would need to pass again on the 2026 ballot to amend the constitution.</p><p>Russell's ruling struck down a challenge by the Coalition for Parents and Children political action committee that claimed the ballot question was inadequate and contained an unfunded mandate, according to a copy of the judge's order.</p><p>Abortion rights up to 24 weeks are already codified into Nevada law through a 1990 referendum vote, where two-thirds of voters were in favor. That can be changed with another referendum vote.</p><p>The standards are higher for amending the constitution, which requires either approval from two legislative sessions and an election, or two consecutive elections with a simple majority of votes.</p><p>The petition that was cleared for signatures is one of two efforts from the Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom committee to get the right to abortion on the 2024 ballot.</p><p>Russell rejected an earlier petition in a November ruling, saying the proposed ballot initiative was too broad, contained a \u201cmisleading description of effect\u201d and had an unfunded mandate.</p><p>The petition would have included protections for \u201cmatters relating to their pregnancies\u201d including prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, birth control, vasectomies, tubal ligations, abortion and abortion care as well as care for miscarriages and infertility. Nevadans for Reproductive Freedoms appealed that rejection to the Nevada Supreme Court and are waiting for a new ruling.</p><p>The petition approved for signatures Tuesday had narrower language \u2014 \u201cestablishing a fundamental, individual right to abortion,\u201d which applies to \u201cdecisions about matters relating to abortion\u201d without government interference.</p><p>In a statement following the ruling, Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom spokesperson Lindsey Hamon celebrated the ruling but said she remained confident that the committee's initial petition will be recognized as eligible by the Nevada Supreme Court.</p><p>\u201cAbortion rights are not the only form of reproductive freedom under attack across the country,\u201d Hamon said. \u201cProtecting miscarriage management, birth control, prenatal and postpartum care, and other vital reproductive health care services are inextricably linked pieces of a singular right to reproductive freedom.\u201d</p><p>Abortion rights have become a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ballot-measure-2024-state-vote-e7d635835dc3a440789ad87787553ec1\">mobilizing issue for Democrats</a> since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 court decision establishing a nationwide right to abortion.</p><p>Constitutional amendments protecting abortion access are already set to appear on the 2024 ballot in New York and Maryland and could also show up in a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ballot-measure-2024-state-vote-e7d635835dc3a440789ad87787553ec1\">host of states</a>, including <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/missouri-abortion-ballot-measure-wording-0821671b0292823fbabbb30f6cdf9824\">Missouri</a> and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-arizona-ballot-voters-2024-a7ea711840cbe2103a9c75c4c4dd4ef3\">neighboring Arizona.</a></p><p>Lawmakers in Nevada\u2019s Democratic-controlled Legislature are also attempting to get reproductive rights including abortion access in front of voters on the 2026 ballot. The initiative, which would enshrine those rights in the state constitution, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nevada-abortion-abortion-rights-2374fc2d78cc380c2afa95fa0c8b0dbe\">passed the state Senate and Assembly</a> in May 2023 and now must be approved with a simple majority again in 2025 before being eligible for the 2026 ballot.</p><p>___</p><p>Stern is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

While abortion is a health-related issue, the focus of the document is more on the legal and political aspects rather than on health itself. It does touch on aspects of reproductive health, but the main emphasis is on the procedural and legislative efforts. Therefore, it is somewhat relevant to the topic of health but not highly focused on health-related content."
