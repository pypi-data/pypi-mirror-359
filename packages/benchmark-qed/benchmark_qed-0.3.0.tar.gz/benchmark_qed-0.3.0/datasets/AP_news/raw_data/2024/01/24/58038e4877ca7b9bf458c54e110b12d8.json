Attorney General Bob Ferguson's announcement Wednesday comes as opioid overdose deaths have risen across the state, with 2,048 in 2022. That\u2019s more than twice as many deaths as there were in 2019. Under the deal, the state and local governments would have to spend $123.3 million to address the opioid crisis, including on substance abuse treatment, expanded access to overdose-reversal drugs and services that support pregnant women on substances.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) \u2014 The Washington state attorney general announced a $149.5 million settlement Wednesday with drugmaker Johnson & Johnson, more than four years after the state sued the company over its role in the opioid addiction crisis.</p><p>\"They knew what the harm was. They did it anyway,\" Attorney General Bob Ferguson told reporters Wednesday.</p><p>The attorney general's announcement came as <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fentanyl-opioids-oregon-washington-legislature-2db8e01e0cdc26fb72f119fe99cdb73a\">opioid overdose deaths</a> more than doubled from 2019 to 2022, with 2,048 deaths recorded in 2022, according to the most recent numbers from the Washington State Department of Health.</p><p>Under the deal, the state and local governments would have to spend $123.3 million to address the opioid crisis, including on substance abuse treatment, expanded access to overdose-reversal drugs and services that support pregnant women on substances. The rest of the money would go toward litigation costs.</p><p>The harm is \u201cleft now to policymakers to grapple with,\u201d the attorney general said, \"or families and individuals who grapple in a very different way with the real tragedy of addiction.\u201d</p><p>The settlement agreement still requires approval from a judge. If approved, the deal would send over $20 million more to respond to the opioid crisis than if the state had signed onto a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-opioids-camden-dec0982c4c40ad08b2b30b725471e000\">national settlement in 2021</a> involving Johnson & Johnson, the attorney general\u2019s office said.</p><p>Since the 2000s, drugmakers, wholesalers, pharmacy chains and consultants have agreed to pay more than $50 billion to state and local governments to settle claims that they played a part in creating the opioid crisis.</p><p>Under the agreements, most of the money is to be used to combat the nation\u2019s addiction and overdose crisis.</p><p>Drug overdoses caused more than 1 million deaths in the U.S. from 1999 through 2021, and the majority of those involved opioids. At first, the crisis centered on prescription painkillers that gained more acceptance in the 1990s, and later heroin. Over the past decade, the death toll has reached an all-time high, and the biggest killers have been <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/synthetic-opioids\">synthetic opioids</a> such as fentanyl that are in the supply of many street drugs.</p><p>Washington state\u2019s Democratic attorney general <a href=\"https://apnews.com/general-news-a2f070c176f48c31a00d34c7c3eba030\">sued Johnson & Johnson in 2020</a>, alleging that it helped drive the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s expansion of prescription opioids. He also claimed that the company made a distinct mark on Washington\u2019s opioid crisis by deceiving doctors and the public about the effectiveness of opioids for chronic pain and the risk of addiction.</p><p>The attorney general\u2019s office noted that in 2015 the company was the largest supplier in the country of the active pharmaceutical ingredients that go into opioid drugs.</p><p>Johnson & Johnson said in a written statement Monday that Duragesic, its fentanyl patch, and its Nucynta opioid accounted for less than 1% of opioid prescriptions in the state and the U.S., adding that it has not sold prescription opioid medications in the country in years.</p><p>\u201cThe Company\u2019s actions relating to the marketing and promotion of important prescription opioid medications were appropriate and responsible,\u201d according to the statement.</p><p>Funds will be awarded by the end of this fiscal year, which means that the Legislature can earmark the money during the current legislative session. Half of the money will go to a state account, while the other half will go to an account for local governments, according to the attorney general\u2019s office.</p><p>Democratic Sen. June Robinson said Wednesday that her children have lost friends to addiction and that she has known parents who have lost children in similar ways.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that these lawsuits have played out since then, they can\u2019t unfortunately bring back the lives that we lost,\" she said. \"But they are bringing resources to our communities and to our state that we are able to invest in ways that will help people recover and hopefully help to prevent future addiction and future crises like the one that we\u2019re seeing right now.\u201d</p><p>The deal comes about two years after the nation\u2019s three largest opioid distributors <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-health-seattle-washington-epidemics-8e7c50c15e10131fdb7ab17e1d63dbfd\">agreed to pay the state $518 million</a>, with the vast majority being directed toward easing the addiction epidemic.</p><p>___</p><p>AP reporter Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, contributed.</p>",
