A small study published Wednesday documents significantly restored hearing in five of six kids treated in China. On Tuesday, the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia announced similar gains in an 11-year-old boy treated there. And earlier this month, Chinese researchers published a study showing positive results in two other children. So far, the experimental therapies only target one rare condition. But scientists say similar treatments could someday help many more kids with other types of hereditary deafness. Genes are responsible for up to 60% of hearing loss in children.",

On Tuesday, the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia announced similar improvements in an 11-year-old boy treated there. And earlier this month, Chinese researchers <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202306788\">published</a> a study showing much the same in two other children.</p><p>So far, the experimental therapies target only one rare condition. But scientists say similar treatments could someday help many more kids with other types of deafness caused by genes. Globally, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/hearing-loss#tab=tab_2\">34 million children</a> have deafness or hearing loss, and genes are responsible for <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hearingloss/data.html\">up to 60%</a> of cases. Hereditary deafness is the latest condition scientists are targeting with gene therapy, which is already approved to treat illnesses such as <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/sickle-cell-fda-approval-vertex-crispr-8d85279d7de0c60888d37afbfa06d39e\">sickle cell disease</a> and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hemophilia-gene-therapy-fda-approval-56ec64489b344e3345a49cb1390cfd10\">severe hemophilia</a>.</p><p>Children with hereditary deafness often get a device called a cochlear implant that helps them hear sound.</p><p>\u201cNo treatment could reverse hearing loss \u2026 That\u2019s why we were always trying to develop a therapy,\u201d said Zheng-Yi Chen of Boston's Mass Eye and Ear, a senior author of the study published Wednesday in the journal Lancet. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more happy or excited about the results.\u201d</p><p>The team captured patients' progress in videos. One shows a baby, who previously couldn\u2019t hear at all, looking back in response to a doctor\u2019s words six weeks after treatment. Another shows a little girl 13 weeks after treatment repeating father, mother, grandmother, sister and \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>All the children in the experiments have a condition that accounts for 2% to 8% of inherited deafness. It's caused by mutations in a gene responsible for an inner ear protein called otoferlin, which helps hair cells transmit sound to the brain. The one-time therapy delivers a functional copy of that gene to the inner ear during a surgical procedure. Most of the kids were treated in one ear, although one child in the two-person study was treated in both ears.</p><p>The study with six children took place at Fudan University in Shanghai, co-led by Dr. Yilai Shu, who trained in Chen's lab, which collaborated on the research. Funders include Chinese science organizations and biotech company Shanghai Refreshgene Therapeutics.</p><p>Researchers observed the children for about six months. They don't know why the treatment didn't work in one of them. But the five others, who previously had complete deafness, can now hear a regular conversation and talk with others. Chen estimates they now hear at a level around 60% to 70% of normal. The therapy caused no major side effects.</p><p>Preliminary results from other research have been just as positive. New York's Regeneron Pharmaceuticals announced in October that a child under 2 in a study they sponsored with Decibel Therapeutics showed improvements six weeks after gene therapy. The Philadelphia hospital \u2014 one of several sites in a test sponsored by a subsidiary of Eli Lilly called Akouos \u2014 reported that their patient, Aissam Dam of Spain, heard sounds for the first time after being treated in October. Though they are muffled like he's wearing foam earplugs, he's now able to hear his father's voice and cars on the road, said Dr. John Germiller, who led the research in Philadelphia.</p><p>\u201cIt was a dramatic improvement,\u201d Germiller said. \u201cHis hearing is improved from a state of complete and profound deafness with no sound at all to the level of mild to moderate hearing loss, which you can say is a mild disability. And that\u2019s very exciting for us and for everyone. \u201d</p><p>Columbia University's Dr. Lawrence Lustig, who is involved in the Regeneron trial, said although the children in these studies don't wind up with perfect hearing, \u201ceven a moderate hearing loss recovery in these kids is pretty astounding.\u201d</p><p>Still, he added, many questions remain, such as how long the therapies will last and whether hearing will continue to improve in the kids.</p><p>Also, some people consider gene therapy for deafness ethically problematic. Teresa Blankmeyer Burke, a deaf philosophy professor and bioethicist at Gallaudet University, said in an email that there\u2019s no consensus about the need for gene therapy targeting deafness. She also pointed out that deafness doesn\u2019t cause severe or deadly illness like, for example, sickle cell disease. She said it's important to engage with deaf community members about prioritization of gene therapy, \"particularly as this is perceived by many as potentially an existential threat to the flourishing of signing Deaf communities.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, researchers said their work is moving forward.</p><p>\"This is real proof showing gene therapy is working,\u201d Chen said. \u201cIt opens up the whole field.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
