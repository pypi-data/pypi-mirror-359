But by then, her lawyers said, she had already traveled out of state for an abortion.</p><p>The Bidens spoke with Cox on Sunday and invited her <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-speaker-johnson-state-of-union-congress-0261fb12de84672acf3011056a5f826f\">to the annual address</a> set for March 7 at the U.S. Capitol. Cox will sit with the first lady, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday. Cox accepted the invitation, she said.</p><p>\u201cThey thanked her for her courage in sharing her story and speaking out against the impact of the extreme abortion ban in Texas,\u201d Jean-Pierre said.</p><p>Cox, 31, was pregnant with her third child when she learned the baby had a rare genetic disorder. The couple was informed by doctors that their baby would live at best a week. She sued over the right to have an abortion to end the pregnancy but lost because <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-kate-cox-texas-exceptions-e85664b2ab76bcb689b1b91913d3e33e\">the judges said she hadn't shown her life was in danger enough to be granted the procedure.</a></p><p>The White House <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/state-of-the-union-biden-guests-cc0d350feb6264e3ce9305355720c508\">invitation reflects how strongly the administration</a> is leaning into reproductive rights as a galvanizing force for voters in the upcoming presidential election after the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned abortion protections. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and their spouses on Tuesday centered their first major campaign rally of the election year on abortion rights.</p><p>Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represented Cox in her legal fight, applauded the invitation and said when Cox travels to Washington \u201cshe will be representing thousands of others suffering under draconian state abortion bans.\u201d</p><p>In his speech, Biden spoke about the increased medical challenges women are facing since the fall of the legal protections granted in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0\">Roe v. Wade</a>, particularly for women who never intended to end their pregnancies. He laid the blame on Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, who as president appointed three conservative justices to the Supreme Court.</p><p>This will be the first State of the Union under Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who will sit behind the president and to his left during the address to Congress. This year\u2019s speech will offer an opportunity for Biden to detail his broader vision and policy priorities as he campaigns for reelection in November.</p>",
