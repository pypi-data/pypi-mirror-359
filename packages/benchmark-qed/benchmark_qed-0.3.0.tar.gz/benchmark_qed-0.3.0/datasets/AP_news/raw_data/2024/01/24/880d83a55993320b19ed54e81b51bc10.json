Tony Evers vowed in his State of the State speech Tuesday to veto any bill that would limit access to abortions and announced plans to expand access to emergency contraception.</p><p>Evers also declared 2024 the \u201cYear of the Worker\" and called on Republicans and Democrats to work together on addressing workforce issues, including expanding access to affordable housing, child care and paid family leave.</p><p>Evers also called on the Legislature to release funding to address PFAS pollution.</p><p>Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos derided the address, Evers sixth State of the State, as \u201ctypical Tony Evers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a lot of new ideas and a lot of rehashing of old things that have been proposed over the course of the past few years and failed,\u201d Vos said.</p><p>Evers issued his abortion veto pledge even as Republicans <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-abortion-14-weeks-bill-referendum-b30271e482ffab0b19f50797bde6062c\">move forward with a measure</a> that would let voters weigh in on whether it should be banned after 14 weeks of pregnancy.</p><p>The speech comes as Evers and Republicans who control the Legislature have had some bipartisan successes, but continue to fight over redistricting, abortion, tax cuts, election administration and other key issues in a presidential election year.</p><p>Evers, like many Democrats nationwide, made abortion rights a focus of his winning 2022 campaign, and he returned to that theme again Tuesday. He noted that his opponent, Republican Tim Michels, supported banning abortions and lost.</p><p>\u201cI want to speak directly to women in Wisconsin tonight,\u201d Evers said. \u201cI will veto any bill that takes away your reproductive freedom or makes reproductive health care any less accessible in Wisconsin than it is today. Period.\u201d</p><p>Evers announced that enrollees in the state\u2019s BadgerCare Plus Medicaid program will have access to over-the-counter contraception, including emergency contraception, without a separate prescription. The medication will be provided without any out-of-pocket costs, Evers said.</p><p>Evers said the public\u2019s widespread support of abortion rights as shown in statewide and nationwide polls shows the importance of having legislative maps that fairly reflect the population. The Wisconsin Supreme Court in December <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-redistricting-supreme-court-republican-democrat-ddaf0fff5a2d91ddbefc4a85a30534ce\">tossed out the current Republican-drawn maps</a> as unconstitutional.</p><p>\u201cWhen elected officials gerrymander themselves into safe seats, they can comfortably ignore the overwhelming majority of Wisconsinites,\u201d Evers said.</p><p>Evers also renewed his pledge to fight efforts to make it more difficult to vote in the battleground state. Evers has vetoed a raft of Republican proposals over the past five years that seek to make changes to election administration in the state.</p><p>Evers said that in coming weeks he will be announcing new steps his administration is taking to increase voter turnout. He didn\u2019t reveal any details.</p><p>Vos said he was disappointed that Evers didn't mention cutting taxes as <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-republicans-tax-cut-surplus-veto-384bf5ab8d9def710996390ffa7739e2\">Republicans have proposed</a>.</p><p>\u201cWe're going to move forward with our plan and hopefully Gov. Evers once he has a chance to review them will sign them into law,\u201d Vos said.</p><p>Despite the divisions, Evers called on Republicans and Democrats to work together to address <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-evers-legislature-child-care-special-session-3df1f2fbf34b5c7411d35b775d50c791\">Wisconsin's workforce shortages</a>, declaring 2024 the \"Year of the Worker.\"</p><p>Evers called for expanding paid family leave, an idea the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/politics-wisconsin-state-government-us-republican-party-tony-evers-55749595fc3a4908ecf798f13b157492\">Legislature rejected last year</a>, investing more in public education and coming up with a long-term solution to child care shortages.
