    "description_summary": "The South Dakota Senate has approved a resolution for a 2024 ballot measure to impose work requirements for Medicaid expansion recipients. The measure now moves to the House of Representatives. South Dakota voters in 2022 approved a constitutional amendment for expanding eligibility of the government health insurance program. Adding a work requirement to that expansion would require approval from the federal government. Prime sponsors of the measure said Thursday that it encourages people to work. Opponents called the work requirement unnecessary, ineffective at encouraging work and said it goes against the will of the voters.",

The change, which took effect last summer, greatly increased the number of people who qualify for Medicaid.</p><p>The work requirement would still need to be approved by voters in November, and the federal government would then have to sign off on it.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-kristi-noem-legislature-south-dakota-1e434f22dc43b9187212f541f5f9babf\">The 2022 constitutional amendment</a> expanded Medicaid eligibility to people who earn up to 138% of the federal poverty level, which the state Department of Social Services says is up to $41,400 for a family of four.</p><p>The expansion was previously opposed by both Republican Gov. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-dakota-economy-kristi-noem-legislature-8024062c8db4a789f0e14f3d8c6554fe\">Kristi Noem</a> and the GOP-controlled Legislature, which defeated a proposed Medicaid expansion <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-business-senate-elections-legislature-elections-a61dc3fa706c5bacf9ae8eb041703860\">earlier in 2022.</a></p><p>\u201cReally, it's a fundamental question,\u201d Republican Senate Majority Leader Casey Crabtree, a prime sponsor of the work requirement, told reporters. \u201cDo we want to incentivize those who can, or are able-bodied, those who can work, to do so? Or do we want to leave a gap where government dependency can become a way of life?\u201d</p><p>He asserted that work requirements on other state programs have been successful.</p><p>Opponents lamented the work requirement as unnecessary, ineffective at encouraging work and going against the will of the voters \u2014 as well as creating more paperwork.</p><p>\u201cThis is about government bureaucracy,\u201d Democratic Senate Minority Leader Reynold Nesiba said. \u201cThis is about denying health care to people who otherwise qualify for it.\u201d</p><p>Republican Sen. John Wiik bemoaned the 2022 measure as \u201ca petition mostly from out-of-state money to put a federal program into our constitution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur hands are effectively tied. We need to go back to the voters every time we want to make a change to this program,\" he said. \u201cAnd this is the point we need to learn: Direct democracy doesn't work.\u201d</p><p>Republican Rep. Tony Venhuizen, another prime sponsor, said the resolution is a \u201cclarifying question\u201d that wouldn't reverse the 2022 vote.</p><p>\u201cIf this amendment was approved, and if the federal government allowed a work requirement, and if we decided we wanted to implement a work requirement, two or three steps down the line from now, we would have to talk about what exemptions are available,\u201d Venhuizen told a Senate panel on Wednesday.</p><p>The expanded eligibility took effect July 1, 2023. Roughly 18,000 South Dakotans are enrolled in Medicaid expansion, according to state Secretary of Social Services Matt Althoff. Of those, 12,000 are already receiving food assistance, thus meeting a work requirement.</p><p>More people are expected to enroll in Medicaid expansion, something the Legislature's budget writers are trying to estimate, Venhuizen said. The 2022 measure was estimated to expand eligibility to 42,500 people.</p>",
