    "description_summary": "Puerto Rico\u2019s government has narrowly avoided an indefinite strike at the U.S. territory\u2019s biggest public health institution after reaching an agreement with union leaders. The looming strike at the Medical Center was scheduled to start Friday at midnight. It would have been the newest blow to Puerto Rico\u2019s crumbling health system given that the center provides care not available at other institutions on the island. The deal was reached Thursday after health workers who had been demanding better working conditions and a monthly salary increase of up to $2,000 agreed to an increase of up to $800 after months of negotiations.",
