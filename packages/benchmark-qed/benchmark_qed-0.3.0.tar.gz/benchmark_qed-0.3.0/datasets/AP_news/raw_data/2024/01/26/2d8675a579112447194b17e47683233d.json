He canceled engagements and was urged to rest ahead of the procedure. which had concluded by Friday afternoon.</p><p>\u201cThe King was this morning admitted to a London hospital for scheduled treatment,\u2019\u2019 the palace said. \u201cHis Majesty would like to thank all those who have sent their good wishes over the past week.\u2033</p><p>The king decided to announce the surgery in advance in an effort to encourage other men to have their prostates checked in line with public health advice.</p><p>The palace said the king was \u201cdelighted to learn that his diagnosis is having a positive impact on public health awareness.\u2019\u2019</p><p>The prostate is a small gland that surrounds the urethra \u2014 the tube that carries urine out of the body. An enlarged prostate can put pressure on the urethra and make it more difficult to urinate.</p><p>Britain\u2019s National Health Service recommends that men see their doctors if they notice any problems with, or changes in, their usual pattern of urination.
