The health centers are under stress as they work to meet the specific needs of their communities because of uncertain funding and staffing issues. The number of people seeking care increased 45% in a decade. The centers treat a range of populations, including migrants, rural residents with limited health care options and multiple generations of families.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Elisa Reyes has come to Plaza del Sol Family Health Center for doctor\u2019s appointments for more than a decade. Though she moved away a while ago, the 33-year-old keeps returning, even if it means a two-hour roundtrip bus ride.</p><p>That\u2019s because her two children see the same doctor she does. Because when she\u2019s sick, she can walk in without an appointment. Because the staff at the Queens clinic helped her apply for health insurance and food stamps.</p><p>\u201cI feel at home. They also speak my language,\u201d Reyes said in Spanish. \u201cI feel comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Plaza del Sol is one of two dozen sites run by Urban Health Plan Inc., which is one of nearly 1,400 federally designated community health centers. One in 11 Americans rely on these to get routine medical care, social services and, in some cases, fresh food.</p><p>The clinics serve as a critical safety net in every state and U.S. territory for low-income people of all ages. But it\u2019s a safety net under stress.</p><p>Since 2012, community health centers have seen a 45% increase in the number of people seeking care \u2014 and they\u2019ve opened more and more service sites to expand their footprint to more than 15,000 locations.</p><p>Many centers are short-staffed and struggling to compete for doctors, mental health professionals, nurses and dentists. Leaders also told The Associated Press that funding is an ever-present concern, with the months-long <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/budget-spending-congress-extend-shutdown-fa6958e60fd2c08880b21e091f108215\">debate over the federal budget</a> making it all but impossible for them to plan and hire for the long term.</p><p>Despite that, the centers are trying to improve their communities\u2019 health and access to primary care in the face of inequities that start well before a patient steps into an exam room.</p><hl2>Facing health inequities</hl2><p>Community health centers have been around, in some form, for decades, and they are largely what remains to serve a community when urban and rural hospitals <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/birthing-rural-hospitals-maternity-care-births-e67a91d927eb545459e83bc7b2b95a0d\">close or cut back</a>.</p><p>Dr. Matthew Kusher, Plaza del Sol\u2019s clinical director, said there are things that prescriptions can\u2019t change, like stopping the spread of flu and COVID-19 when people live in apartments with one family per room and it\u2019s impossible to quarantine.</p><p>\u201cWhat we provide here is only 20% of what goes toward somebody\u2019s health,\u201d Kusher said. \u201cTheir health is more driven by the other factors, more driven by the poverty, and the lack of access to food or clean water or healthy air.\u201d</p><p>Nine in 10 health center patients live at or below 200% of the federal poverty line, according to the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration. Beyond that:</p><p>\u2014 In 2022, nearly 1.4 million health center patients were homeless.</p><p>\u2014 One in five was uninsured.</p><p>\u2014 Half were on Medicaid.</p><p>\u2014 One in four was best served in a language other than English; about 63% were racial or ethnic minorities.</p><p>\u201cWe confront these disparities head-on in the communities that need it the most,\u201d said Dr. Kyu Rhee, president of the National Association of Community Health Centers. \u201cWe have a workforce that works nonstop, diligently and is resilient and diverse \u2014 that represents the people they serve. And that trust is so essential.\u201d</p><p>Plaza del Sol\u2019s specialty case manager Yelisa Sierra said she frequently fields questions about people needing clothes, food or shelter. Lately, the clinic serves many newly arrived <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/immigration-migrants-border-health-care-us-mexico-79353b08f07933f66961a7f07cf3e397\">migrants</a>. She wishes she had a better answer to the question she hears most: Where can they find work?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not only a medical need, it\u2019s emotion,\u201d said Sierra, sitting in a cramped office off the bustling waiting room. \u201cThey need to have a person that listens. Sometimes, it\u2019s just that.\u201d</p><p>Fifty years ago, Dr. Acklema Mohammad started as a medical assistant in Urban Health Plan\u2019s first clinic, San Juan Health Center. She has cared for some families across three generations.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so gratifying to work in this community. I\u2019m walking through the door, or I\u2019m walking down the street, and I\u2019m getting hugs,\u201d she said. \u201cAll along, \u2018Oh Dr. Mo! You\u2019re still here!\u2019\u201d</p><p>Staffing is Mohammad\u2019s biggest worry. Many pediatricians retired or left for other jobs after the worst of the pandemic. It\u2019s not just about money, either: She said job applicants tell her they want quality of life and flexibility, no weekends or long hours.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big job and it\u2019s a big issue because we have so many sick children and so many sick patients,\u201d Mohammad said, \u201cbut we don\u2019t have enough providers to take care of them.\u201d</p><p>Former pediatricians are sometimes picking up virtual visits to provide relief, she said, and telehealth helps, too.</p><p>When patients can\u2019t do telehealth, El Nuevo San Juan Health Center tries to bring care to them instead. About 150 elders get at-home visits, said Dr. Manuel Vazquez, Urban Health Plan\u2019s vice president of medical affairs who oversees the home health program.</p><p>There are times when the home visit isn\u2019t covered, but the team does it anyway, without getting paid.</p><p>\u201cWe said, \u2018No. We need to do this,\u2019\u201d he said.</p><hl2>Building community trust</hl2><p>One of the nation\u2019s first community health centers opened in the rural Mississippi delta in 1967, in the wake of the Civil Rights Movement\u2019s Freedom Summer.</p><p>Delta Health Center in Mound Bayou, Mississippi today operates the health center has 17 locations in five counties, including free-standing clinics and some in schools.</p><p>Staffers are taking on challenges that have been around for generations, like hunger and limited transportation. There are cooking classes and vegetables from the community garden. In nearby Leland, there\u2019s a clinic in the town of less than 4,000 \u2014 open Saturdays, too \u2014 because many people don\u2019t have a car to make the 15-minute highway drive to Greenville, the nearest small city, and there\u2019s no public transportation.</p><p>That kind of access to preventive health care is critical as area hospitals cut back on <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mississippi-hospital-birth-labor-delivery-health-63cca907518db6e54bcae9cd01047835\">neonatal services</a> and other specialty care, said Temika Simmons, Delta Health Center\u2019s chief public affairs officer.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re in the middle of a heart attack, you\u2019re going to have to be airlifted to Jackson or Memphis where they have the equipment to save your life, and so you might die along the way,\u201d she said.</p><p>Another key to the centers\u2019 ability to improve health disparities is understanding and being part of their communities.</p><p>Plaza del Sol is located in the heavily immigrant, mostly Latino neighborhood of Corona, which was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pandemics-new-york-coronavirus-pandemic-us-news-queens-04b6e5a1e2ec9bf5bb6f49469d4feabe\">the epicenter of New York City\u2019s COVID-19 spread.</a> Staff are required to speak Spanish. They regularly go to a local church to host vaccination clinics that reach hundreds. Center director Angelica Flores-DaSilva said a local principal will call her directly and ask for help to vaccinate kids so they don\u2019t get disenrolled.</p><p>In Mississippi, workers are trained to spot signs of abuse, or know that the patient \u201cfussing and fighting\u201d about filling out a form likely can\u2019t read. They hand out clothes, food and resources as if they\u2019re being offered to everyone.</p><p>\u201cPeople hide their circumstances extremely well,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cThey hide illiteracy well, they hide poverty well, and they hide abuse very well. They know exactly what to say.\u201d</p><p>To continue to serve the communities in the way they want to, center leaders say they\u2019re stretching dollars are far as they can \u2014 but need more.</p><p>Based on the rising number of patients and inflation in the health care sector, federal funding for centers would need to increase by $2.1 billion to match 2015 funding levels, according to an analysis sponsored <a href=\"https://www.hcadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/OverlookedDeclineCHCFunding_2023.pdf\">by the National Association of Community Health Centers.</a></p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be overwhelmed with the problem,\u201d Simmons said. \"You've got to just simply take it one day at a time, one patient at a time.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press data journalist Kasturi Pananjady contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
