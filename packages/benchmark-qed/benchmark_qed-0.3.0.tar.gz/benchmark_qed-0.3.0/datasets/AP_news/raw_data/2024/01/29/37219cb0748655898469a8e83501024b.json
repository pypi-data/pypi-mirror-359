And fewer than half of women got it right for a 60-year-old woman.</p><p>Advisers call this \u2014 understanding how long you\u2019ll live in your retirement years \u2014 longevity literacy. It\u2019s a crucial part of your retirement strategy, and it\u2019s important that you and your financial professional are on the same page. You should be talking about things like what your planner is using as your life expectancy, how you\u2019ll cover future health care costs and whether you need to account for any spending related to aging parents.</p><p>Getting this right means your money will last for as long as you do. Here are the questions to ask your adviser.</p><p>1. WHAT ARE YOU USING AS MY LIFE EXPECTANCY?</p><p>No one can know when they\u2019re going to die, but your health and family history can help your planner make a good guess. How long did your parents live, or your grandparents? Do you have any health conditions?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve started, a few years ago, asking a lot of health questions of my clients,\u201d says Mitchell Kraus, a certified financial planner in Santa Monica, California. \u201cThey should let their adviser know of any health concerns that might cause their life expectancy to be shorter.\u201d</p><p>Planners often work with software that can model what will happen to your finances if you die at different ages, based on the assumptions you\u2019re making. You can explore various scenarios together and decide what makes the most sense.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve got longevity in your family, let\u2019s boost it up to (age) 97 or even 100,\u201d says Timothy Knotts, a CFP in Red Bank, New Jersey. \u201cWe want to make sure we don\u2019t have this thing that keeps you up at night, which is, \u2018Am I going to run out of money?\u2019\u201d</p><p>2. WHAT SHOULD I BE DOING ABOUT LONG-TERM CARE?</p><p>The big wild card in your financial plan is whether (and how long) you\u2019ll need long-term care. There\u2019s a reasonable chance you\u2019ll need some kind of support, so talk to your planner about the best way to prepare.</p><p>You may want to plan to purchase long-term care insurance at some point, or a hybrid policy that combines permanent life insurance with a long-term care rider. Or it may be better to self-insure and plan to use savings for long-term care needs if insurance is too expensive.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something that unfortunately many of us aren\u2019t good at \u2014 the risk and uncertainty thing,\u201d says Paul Yakoboski, a senior economist with the TIAA Institute. \u201cThis is where an adviser could be extremely valuable \u2014 to help us understand likelihoods and scenarios and the costs attached to them.\u201d</p><p>3. HOW SHOULD I PREPARE TO PAY FOR HEALTH CARE NEEDS?</p><p>You may have seen Fidelity\u2019s statistic that a 65-year-old couple today may need $315,000 to pay for health care expenses in retirement. It\u2019s a daunting figure. But making the right health care decisions once you\u2019re eligible for Medicare can help.</p><p>\u201cI think if people have Medicare and a Medicare Supplement, I\u2019ve actually found they have a pretty good chunk of their health care paid for,\u201d says Clark Randall, a CFP in Dallas.</p><p>This is because <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/medicare/medigap-what-to-know-about-medicare-supplement-insurance?utm_campaign=ct_prod&utm_source=ap&utm_medium=mpsyn\">Medicare Supplement Insurance</a>, otherwise known as Medigap, can pay for most out-of-pocket costs associated with your Medicare plan. As long as you can pay the premiums, many of your costs may be covered if you have a big health event.</p><p>\u201cWe also build in some percentage for out-of-pocket expenses,\u201d Knotts says.</p><p>4. SHOULD WE INCLUDE ANY PLANNING FOR MY PARENTS?</p><p>If there are older adults in your life who may need your support later, make sure your adviser knows this and builds it into your retirement plan to the extent that\u2019s possible. Do you anticipate bringing them to live with you or potentially moving in with them? Do you expect an inheritance, or do you expect to have to help pay their bills?</p><p>\u201cI will ask, \u2018Do your parents have enough money to support themselves in retirement?\u2019\u201d says Catherine Valega, a CFP in Winchester, Massachusetts. Clients may be doing everything right, she says, but it doesn\u2019t mean their parents have done everything right.</p><p>Considering these questions may facilitate a conversation with your loved ones about the future, which can be helpful for everyone. If they\u2019re young enough, you can also encourage your parents to look into long-term care insurance for themselves.</p><p>______________________________</p><p>This column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.
