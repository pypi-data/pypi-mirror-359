The news comes as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin returns to work at the Pentagon following a hospitalization related to prostate cancer that was criticized for being kept secret for days. The 71-year-old Garland will be under general anesthesia during the back procedure on Saturday, which will last about 90 minutes. Justice Department spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa says he is expected to return home the same day. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco will take on his duties shortly before the procedure and continue until shortly after it is over.",

Garland will delegate his duties to Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco shortly before, during and for a short time after the procedure as he recovers from the anesthesia, the statement said. He is expected to return to work the week of Feb. 5.</p><p>Austin returned to the Pentagon Monday after nearly a month-long absence. He underwent a surgical procedure for the cancer on Dec. 22 and was released, but was then admitted to intensive care days later after experiencing extreme pain. He stayed there for two weeks but didn\u2019t inform the White House or his deputy that he had cancer, had surgery or returned to the hospital until days later.</p><p>Austin\u2019s lack of disclosure prompted two ongoing reviews as well as <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/president-joe-biden-white-house-lloyd-austin-cabinet-f3e03c04ff7d9a0ab062a57ac181bb8f\">changes in federal guidelines</a> to ensure the White House will be informed any time a Cabinet head can\u2019t carry out their job. The Justice Department notified the White House of the plans to delegate his duties under the new guidelines, White House spokeswoman Olivia Dalton confirmed.</p><p>When Garland went in for a routine medical procedure in 2022, his office also informed the public a week in advance and outlined how long he was expected to be out and when he would return to work.</p>",
