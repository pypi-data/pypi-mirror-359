    "description_summary": "A Los Angeles judge has rejected Cher's request to have her adult son put in a temporary conservatorship. At a hearing Monday in a Los Angeles courtroom, the judge wasn't convinced by arguments from Cher's attorneys that 47-year-old Elijah Blue Allman needs to have the court control his money because of his struggles with mental illness and substance abuse. Cher observed the hearing remotely and appeared on a large screen in the courtroom, but did not speak. The issue isn't over yet. A hearing is set for March on a longer-term conservatorship Cher is seeking over Allman.",

Uzcategui was not convinced that a conservatorship was urgently needed and declined the petition, though she will still consider a larger, long-term conservatorship at a hearing in March.</p><p>Cher observed the hearing remotely. She appeared on a large screen in the courtroom throughout, but did not take part in the arguments.</p><p>Allman was in the courtroom with his his attorneys, who acknowledged his previous struggles but argued that he is in a good place now, attending meetings, getting treatment and reconciling with his previously estranged wife.</p><p>\u201cWe are thrilled that the court saw that he does not need a temporary conservatorship,\u201d Allman\u2019s lawyer said as he stood alongside him outside the courthouse. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of support, he\u2019s doing great.\u201d</p><p>Cher's attorneys argued that the support Allman was getting was from people who tell him what he wants to hear and downplay the size of his problems. They said his current apparent sobriety and mental health were illusory. They said he suffers from bipolar disorder, has been recently homeless, and that having large amounts of money might lead to access to drugs that could endanger his life.</p><p>Blue and his attorneys have consistently argued since the petition was first filed in December that none of this is true.</p><p>Uzcategui had already signaled at a hearing on January 5 that she wasn't inclined to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cher-son-conservatorship-elijah-allman-641f309657b33d8f9a67add1eaa00851\">establish a conservatorship</a>, delaying the decision until Monday because documents had not been shared in time with Allman's attorneys.</p><p>Cher's attorneys said that she was not necessarily seeking any direct control over Allman's money, and would be happy to have a court-appointed fiduciary manage his finances. They did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the judge's decision.</p><p>Court conservatorships, known as guardianships in some states, have come under far greater scrutiny in recent years after a temporary conservatorship imposed on <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/britney-spears-conservatorship-5dbba74b8be90cd233830f2cb001d74c\">Britney Spears</a> in 2008 would end up leaving her without control of her money and major life affairs for nearly 14 years.</p>",
