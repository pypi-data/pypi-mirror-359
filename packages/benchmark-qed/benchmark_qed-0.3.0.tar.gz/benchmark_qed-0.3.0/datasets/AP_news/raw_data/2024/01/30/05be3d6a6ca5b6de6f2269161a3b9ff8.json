    "description_summary": "Nearly 400 people have died of starvation in Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray and Amhara regions in recent months, the country\u2019s ombudsman said Tuesday, a rare admission of hunger-related deaths by a federal body. Local officials have previously reported starvation deaths in their districts, but Ethiopia\u2019s federal government has insisted these reports are \u201ccompletely wrong.\" Ethiopia\u2019s ombudsman office sent experts to the regions, which are gripped by drought and still reeling from devastating civil war that officially ended 14 months ago. They concluded that 351 people have died of hunger in Tigray in the past six months, with 44 more deaths in Amhara. Only a small fraction of needy people in Tigray are receiving food aid, according to an aid memo seen by The Associated Press.",

They concluded that 351 people have died of hunger in Tigray in the past six months, with 44 more deaths in Amhara.</p><p>Only a small fraction of needy people in Tigray are receiving food aid, according to an aid memo seen by The Associated Press, more than one month after aid agencies <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ethiopia-usaid-food-aid-resumption-us-3588aeb9788f9d52da082ca02ed95e06\">resumed deliveries of grain</a> following a lengthy pause over theft.</p><p>Just 14% of 3.2 million people targeted for food aid by humanitarian agencies in Tigray this month had received it by Jan. 21, according to the memo by the Tigray Food Cluster, a group of aid agencies co-chaired by the U.N.\u2019s World Food Program and Ethiopian officials.</p><p>The memo urges humanitarian groups to \u201cimmediately scale up\u201d their operations, warning that \u201cfailure to take swift action now will result in severe food insecurity and malnutrition during the lean season, with possible loss of the most vulnerable children and women in the region.\u201d</p><p>The U.N. and the U.S. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ethiopia-humanitarian-food-aid-theft-us-un-c129b6942663cbfc44c6605fed97928b\">paused food aid</a> to Tigray in mid-March last year after discovering a \u201clarge-scale\u201d scheme to steal humanitarian grain. The suspension was rolled out to the rest of Ethiopia in June. U.S. officials believe the theft may be the biggest diversion of grain ever. Donors have blamed Ethiopian government officials and the military for the fraud.</p><p>The U.N. and the U.S. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ethiopia-usaid-food-aid-resumption-us-3588aeb9788f9d52da082ca02ed95e06\">lifted the pause</a> in December after introducing reforms to curb theft, but Tigray authorities say food is not reaching those who need it.</p><p>Two aid workers told the AP that the new system \u2014 which includes fitting GPS trackers to food trucks and putting QR codes on ration cards \u2014 has been hampered by technical issues. Aid agencies are also struggling with a lack of funds.</p><p>A third aid worker said the food aid pause and the slow resumption meant some people in Tigray have not received food aid for over a year. \u201cThey went through multiple rounds of registration and verification, but no actual distributions yet,\u201d the aid worker said.</p><p>The aid workers spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.</p><p>Around 20.1 million people across Ethiopia need humanitarian food due to drought, conflict and a tanking economy. The aid pause pushed up hunger levels even further.</p><p>The U.S.-funded Famine Early Warning System has warned that crisis levels of hunger or worse \u201care expected in northern, southern and southeastern Ethiopia throughout at least early 2024.\u201d A former head of the WFP has described these levels of hunger as \u201cmarching towards starvation.\u201d</p><p>In Amhara, which shares a border with Tigray, a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ethiopia-oromo-militants-peace-talks-7252be5f8128dc931982f503180235ca\">rebellion that erupted in August</a> is impeding humanitarians\u2019 movements and making distributions difficult, while several regions of Ethiopia have been devastated by a multi-year drought.</p><p>Malnutrition rates among children in parts of Ethiopia\u2019s Afar, Amhara and Oromia regions range between 15.9% and 47%, according to a presentation by the Ethiopia Nutrition Cluster and reviewed by the AP. Among displaced children in Tigray, the rate is 26.5%. The Ethiopia Nutrition Cluster is co-chaired by the U.N. Children's Fund and the federal government.</p><p>Tigray, home to 5.5 million people, was the center of a devastating two-year civil war that killed hundreds of thousands and spilled into the neighboring regions. A U.N. panel accused Ethiopia\u2019s government of using \u201cstarvation as a method of warfare\u201d by restricting food aid to Tigray during the conflict, which ended in November 2022 with a peace deal.</p><p>Persistent insecurity meant only 49% of Tigray\u2019s farmland was planted during the main planting season last year, according to an assessment by U.N. agencies, NGOs and the regional authorities, and seen by the AP.</p><p>Crop production in these areas was only 37% of the expected total because of drought. In some areas the proportion was as low as 2%.</p><p>The poor harvest prompted Tigray\u2019s authorities to warn of an \u201cunfolding famine\u201d that could match the disaster of 1984-5, which killed hundreds of thousands of people across northern Ethiopia, unless the aid response is immediately scaled up.</p><p>But Ethiopia\u2019s federal government denies there is a large hunger crisis. When Tigray\u2019s leader, Getachew Reda, raised the alarm over looming mass starvation deaths last month, a federal government spokesperson dismissed the reports as \u201cinaccurate\u201d and accused him of \u201cpoliticizing the crisis.\u201d</p>",
