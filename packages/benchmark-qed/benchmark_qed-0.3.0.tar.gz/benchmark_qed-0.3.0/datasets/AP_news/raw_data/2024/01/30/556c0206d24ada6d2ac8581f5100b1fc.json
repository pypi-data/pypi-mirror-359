The New York drugmaker on Tuesday also reaffirmed its forecast for 2024, a month after surprising Wall Street with an outlook that missed consensus. In the fourth quarter, Pfizer booked 8% operational revenue growth outside its market-leading COVID vaccine, Comirnaty, and treatment, Paxlovid. That excludes the impact of foreign exchanges. Comirnaty sales tumbled 53% in the quarter to $5.4 billion. Pfizer also took a $3.1 billion hit from Paxlovid for a revenue reversal.",

That excludes the impact of foreign exchanges.</p><p>Comirnaty sales tumbled 53% in the quarter to $5.4 billion, and Pfizer took a $3.1 billion hit from Paxlovid for a revenue reversal. That was tied to the return of unused treatment courses that had been purchased by the government.</p><p>The vaccine and treatment helped push Pfizer past $100 billion in sales for 2022. But a big sales drop was expected after the drugmaker switched last year to selling on the commercial market instead relying on bulk government contracts.</p><p>A Pfizer spokeswoman said the company expects to start recovering some of that revenue reversal from Paxlovid this year. Pfizer will contribute to a government stockpile of treatment courses and help establish a patient assistance program.</p><p>Overall, Pfizer lost $3.37 billion in the final quarter of 2023 after booking a nearly $5 billion profit in the same quarter the prior year. But earnings adjusted for one-time items came to 10 cents per share.</p><p>Analysts had expected a loss of 18 cents per share, according to the data firm FactSet.</p><p>Pfizer\u2019s total revenue fell 41% in the quarter to $14.25 billion. That missed the consensus expectation for $14.37 billion.</p><p>For the full year, Pfizer earned $2.1 billion on $58.5 billion in total revenue.</p><p>The drugmaker says it still expects 2024 adjusted earnings to range between $2.05 and $2.25 per share.</p><p>Analysts expect $2.27 per share this year. But Wall Street expectations also are dialed back now from previous consensus forecasts made last fall for earnings per share of $3.17 or more.</p><p>Pfizer debuted its 2024 forecast in December. It included sales expectations for its COVID-19 products that fell more than $5 billion short of expectations. The company said then that it was starting conservatively to avoid creating any more uncertainty.</p><p>The company <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pfizer-vaccine-covid-comirnaty-paxlovid-3f3d5291232c08c21fe3a11f143f76ff\">had previously scaled back</a> its sales expectations for 2023, which sent Pfizer shares plunging and contributed to a rough year for the stock.</p><p>Pfizer Inc. shares rose about 3% in early trading Tuesday.</p>",
