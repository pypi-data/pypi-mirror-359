The vote is a key step in a legislative process that also requires a Senate\u2019s vote. The measure has been promised by President Emmanuel Macron following a rollback of abortion rights in the United States. A constitutional amendment must pass both chambers of parliament and then be approved either in a referendum or by a three-fifths majority of a joint session of parliament. Macron\u2019s government is aiming for the second method, though the measure\u2019s level of support in the Senate is less certain than in the National Assembly.",
