House Speaker Pro Tempore Sarah Stevens confirmed on Tuesday her disease and a high likelihood of a full recovery. Stevens says she was diagnosed in August and had a tumor removed. She's wrapping up chemotherapy and is about to begin radiation. Stevens says she was previously diagnosed with breast cancer two decades ago, but that this cancer is separate and apart from the past illness. Stevens was first elected to the House in 2008 and became speaker pro tempore in 2017.",
