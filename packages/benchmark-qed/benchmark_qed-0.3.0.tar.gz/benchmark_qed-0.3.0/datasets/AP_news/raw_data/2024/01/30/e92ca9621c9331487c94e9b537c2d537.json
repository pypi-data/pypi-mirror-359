In a Monday post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, Musk said that the patient received the implant the day prior and was recovering well. The billionaire did not provide additional details about the patient. Neuralink reposted Musk\u2019s Monday post on X, but did not publish any additional statements acknowledging the human implant.

    "body_nitf": "<p>NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 According to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/elon-musk\">Elon Musk</a>, the first human received an implant from his computer-brain interface company Neuralink over the weekend.</p><p>In a Monday <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1752098683024220632\">post on X</a>, the platform formerly known as Twitter, Musk said that the patient received the implant the day prior and was \u201crecovering well.\u201d He added that \u201cinitial results show promising neuron spike detection.\u201d</p><p>The billionaire, who co-founded Neuralink, did not provide additional details about the patient. When Neuralink announced in September that it would begin recruiting people, the company said it was searching for individuals with quadriplegia due to cervical spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as ALS or Lou Gehrig\u2019s Disease.</p><p>Neuralink is one of many groups working on <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pain-management-pittsburgh-stroke-health-198f8bdfc5803ef3594e9916685fe739\">linking the nervous system to computers</a>, efforts aimed at helping treat brain disorders, overcoming brain injuries and other applications. There are more than <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=brain+computer+interface&Search=Apply&recrs=b&recrs=a&recrs=f&recrs=d&age_v=&gndr=&type=&rslt=\">40 brain computer interface trials</a> underway, according to clinicaltrials.gov.</p><p>Neuralink reposted Musk's Monday post on X, but did not publish any additional statements acknowledging the human implant. The company did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment Tuesday.</p><p>Neuralink <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-interface-7e80956022b1d8f31ee24ed7c1fe1138\">previously announced</a> that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved its \u201cinvestigational device exemption,\u201d which generally allows a sponsor to begin a clinical study \u201cin patients who fit the inclusion criteria,\u201d the FDA said Tuesday. The agency pointed out that it can\u2019t confirm or disclose information about a particular study.</p><p>Neuralink\u2019s device is about the size of a large coin and is designed to be implanted in the skull, with ultra-thin wires going directly into the brain. In its September announcement, Neuralink said the wires would be surgically placed in a region of the brain that controls movement intention. The initial goal of the so-called brain computer interface is to give people the ability to control a computer cursor or keyboard using their thoughts alone.</p><p>In a separate Monday <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1752118131579867417\">post on X</a>, Musk said that the first Neuralink product is called \u201cTelepathy\u201d \u2014 which, he said, will enable users to control their phones or computers \u201cjust by thinking.\u201d He added that intial users would be those who have lost use of their limbs.</p><p>It\u2019s unclear how well this device or similar interfaces will ultimately work, or how safe they might be. Clinical trials are designed to collect data on safety and effectiveness.</p><p>Laura Cabrera, who researches brain science at Pennsylvania State University, said that even though Neuralink uses an innovative procedure \u2013 robotic surgery \u2013 to get the device in the brain, no one has implanted it before in humans and much remains unknown.</p><p>Brain surgery is \u201cnot a trivial thing,\u201d she said, pointing to significant potential risks such as brain hemorrhage or seizures. \u201cAnd so I think we have to be mindful that even though they\u2019re using a novel way to implant the device, we just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s truly going to be a \u2026 safer approach for human patients.\u201d</p><p>She pointed out that Neuralink\u2019s competitors plan to use their devices for medical applications only, but Musk has been outspoken about going beyond medicine. For example, Cabrera said, Musk has talked about implants for the masses that will allow people to record everything that happens to them and access the information when they want \u2014 which may raise red flags for some.</p><p>\u201cWe know that he has very bold claims,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople not really assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the technology is something that I worry about.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Ungar reported from Columbia, Missouri.
