Cigna said Wednesday the deal includes its Medicare Advantage coverage, a supplemental benefits business and Medicare prescription drug coverage.

Cigna CEO David Cordani said in a statement that his company still sees Medicare as an attractive market. But that business required a focus and resources that were disproportionate to their size within the company\u2019s portfolio.",
