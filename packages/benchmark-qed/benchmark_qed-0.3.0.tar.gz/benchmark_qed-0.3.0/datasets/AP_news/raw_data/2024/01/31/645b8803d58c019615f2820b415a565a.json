The 86-year-old monarch, who has repeatedly said he has no plans to abdicate unlike his second cousin Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, has been hospitalized several times in recent months. In December, he was admitted to a hospital with an infection and was treated with intravenous antibiotics. The heir to the throne, Crown Prince Haakon, has stepped in and taken over his father\u2019s duties, the royal household said. Harald\u2019s duties as Norway\u2019s head of state are ceremonial and he holds no political power.",
