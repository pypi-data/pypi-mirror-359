Insurance companies that require prior authorization for health care services would be required to gather information through a standardized online portal. Insurers also would be required to use relevant medical specialists to review requests for services. Senate Bill 2140 passed without opposition. It goes to the House for more work. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves vetoed a similar bill last year. Senate Insurance Committee Chairman Walter Michel says the new bill includes changes the governor wanted.",
