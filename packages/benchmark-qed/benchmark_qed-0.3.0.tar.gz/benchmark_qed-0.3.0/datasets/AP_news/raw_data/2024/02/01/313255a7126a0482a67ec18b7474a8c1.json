    "body_nitf": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday he never told his staff to keep his cancer surgery and hospitalization secret from the White House, but acknowledged he should have handled it differently and he apologized for keeping President Joe Biden and others in the dark for weeks.</p><p>\u201cWe did not handle this right and I did not handle this right. I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I take full responsibility,\u201d Austin told reporters in a lengthy Pentagon briefing. \u201cI have apologized directly to President Biden and I\u2019ve told him that I\u2019m deeply sorry for not letting him know immediately that I received a heavy diagnosis and was getting treatment.\u201d</p><p>Known as an intensely private man, Austin provided his most extensive comments to date on the secrecy surrounding his cancer diagnosis and struggles with complications since his surgery on Dec. 22. It was the first time he has answered questions from reporters since his cancer surgery, and his answers were often bluntly personal, offering rare insights into the deeply private matter.</p><p>\u201cThe news shook me,\u201d Austin, 70, said about getting the initial diagnosis in early December. \u201cIt was a gut punch. And, frankly my first instinct was to keep it private.\u201d</p><p>While he said he \"never directed anyone to keep my January hospitalization from the White House,\u201d Austin dodged questions about any repercussions on his staff or any decisions they made about disclosing it.</p><p>He said he doesn't believe he has created \u201ca culture of secrecy\u201d in his office. And he said he did not tell his aides to ask first responders to avoid using lights and sirens when calling for an ambulance on Jan. 1. But, he acknowledged, \u201cthere will be security officers, there will be other staff members who may perceive that they\u2019re doing things in my best interest.\u201d</p><p>His lack of disclosure prompted <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/president-joe-biden-white-house-lloyd-austin-cabinet-f3e03c04ff7d9a0ab062a57ac181bb8f\">changes in federal guidelines</a> and triggered an internal Pentagon review and an inspector general review into his department\u2019s notification procedures. Both reviews are ongoing, and members of Congress have called for hearings on the matter.</p><p>Austin was taken by ambulance to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Jan. 1 after experiencing extreme pain due to complications from the surgery. He was admitted to the intensive care unit the next day. He was released from the hospital on Jan. 15.</p><p>He transferred decision-making authorities to Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, but did not tell her why. Some top staff members were told about his hospitalization on Jan. 2, but no one told the White House or the president until two days later. His hospitalization was publicly announced on Jan. 5, but his cancer diagnosis and surgery were not disclosed until the following week.</p><p>A key question is why Austin's chief of staff Kelly Magsamen or his senior military assistant, Lt. Gen. Ron Clark, didn't inform the White House or key leaders more quickly.</p><p>Austin's solo appearance in the Pentagon briefing room was also a rare moment. He is known for avoiding the media as much as possible. But he appeared calm and even joked a few times during the 35-minute press conference. His ongoing leg pain was evident as he walked carefully to the podium, but he said he expects to recover, although it will be incremental and take time.</p><p>Pressed on why he didn't tell the president and others about his diagnosis and surgery, Austin said, \u201cI\u2019m a pretty private guy. I never like burdening others with my problems. It\u2019s just not my way.\u201d He added that the president has a lot of things on his plate and he didn't want to add his personal issue to that.</p><p>\u201cI apologize to my teammates and to the American people,\u201d he said.</p><p>He said he has learned from the experience. \u201cTaking this kind of job means losing some of the privacy that most of us expect,\u201d he said. \u201cThe American people have a right to know if their leaders are facing health challenges that might affect their ability to perform their duties even temporarily. So a wider circle should have been notified, especially the president.\u201d</p><p>Austin also acknowledged that he missed a crucial opportunity to use his prostate check and early discovery of the cancer as a teaching moment, for his many male troops and workers across the department, and, even more importantly, for the African American population.</p><p>Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among American men. It affects 1 in every 8 men \u2014 and 1 in every 6 African American men \u2014 during their lifetime.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here with a clear message to other men, especially older men,\u201d Austin said. \u201cGet screened, get your regular checkups. Prostate cancer has a glass jaw. If your doctor can spot it, they can treat it and beat it.\u201d</p><p>Asked about the matter earlier in January, Biden said it was a lapse in judgment for Austin not to tell him about his hospitalization, but he said he still has confidence in his Pentagon chief.</p><p>Austin, who worked from home for two weeks after his release from the hospital, returned to work in the Pentagon on Monday. He had not been in the building since Dec. 21.</p>",

            "reason": "The document discusses Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's cancer diagnosis, surgery, and hospitalization, which are directly related to his health. It also touches on the implications of his health issues on his duties and the importance of prostate cancer screening, which is relevant to public health awareness. However, the document also includes significant details about the political and procedural aspects of the situation, which are not directly related to health. Therefore, while the document is relevant to the topic of health, it is not exclusively focused on it."
