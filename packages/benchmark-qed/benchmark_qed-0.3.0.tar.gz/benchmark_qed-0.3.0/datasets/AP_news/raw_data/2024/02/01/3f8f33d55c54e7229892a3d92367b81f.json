They are, it seems, entering the era of \u201ccozy cardio,\u201d an activity that lies right at the crossroads of gym workout, self-pampering evening \u2026 and nap time.</p><p>This method of (minimal) calorie burning has gained popularity on TikTok and Instagram ever since a woman named <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hope_zuckerbrow/\">Hope Zuckerbrow</a> began posting videos in late 2022. Let\u2019s describe it by what it doesn\u2019t do. It doesn\u2019t require you to:</p><p>\u2014squeeze into spandex workout clothes;</p><p>\u2014head out into the cold to drive to a fluorescently lit gym;</p><p>\u2014lift heavy things;</p><p>\u2014get winded to the beat of pulsating music.</p><p>Cozy cardio simply involves walking in place \u2013 in the comfort of your home \u2013 using a mini treadmill or \u201cwalking pad.\u201d No stress, no membership fees, no preening for other, buffer-than-thou gym rats. And you can even have a cup of hot tea by your side.</p><p>\u201cI get so many messages from men and women \u2013 so many people \u2013 saying something along the lines of \u2018thank you so much for kind of flipping my mindset on what I thought exercise is supposed to be,\u2019\u201d Zuckerbrow says. \u201cThis feels so doable.\u201d</p><hl2>THE SELF-PAMPERING WORKOUT</hl2><p>The key is the setup.</p><p>Wearing soft sweatpants and your favorite comfy shirt, you light a few scented candles, make a healthy smoothie or pot of tea, dim the lights and put on a favorite TV show or movie. With your drink handy, you walk for an hour while getting lost in whatever you\u2019re watching, maybe walking just a bit more vigorously once you\u2019re warmed up.</p><p>Forget \u201cno pain, no gain.\u201d Cozy cardio acknowledges that maybe you can\u2019t take much more pain at this particular moment, so just enjoy getting some steps in while binge-watching \u201cThe Bear\u201d in your pajamas and call that your workout.</p><p>When Zuckerbrow posts on social media, \u201c80% to 90% of the video itself is me romanticizing the exercise that I\u2019m about to do,\u201d she says. \u201cI am setting up my favorite beverage and I\u2019m lighting those candles and my Scentsy and I\u2019m getting my TV show.\u201d</p><p>No, walking won\u2019t give you six-pack abs. But could cozy cardio, which embraces the most appealing aspects of being a couch potato while keeping you off the couch, help even hardcore gym-avoiders stick with exercise long after New Year\u2019s resolution season ends?</p><p>For people battling the common barriers to exercise, the answer could be yes, says Alex Montoye, assistant professor of clinical exercise physiology at Alma College in Michigan.</p><p>Montoye cautions that if you\u2019re downshifting from vigorous daily workouts to something this mellow, the health benefits may plummet. But for someone who would otherwise watch TV from the couch, he says, it\u2019s progress to watch while walking \u2014 especially if it becomes a daily habit.</p><p>People struggle to make healthy habits stick, which makes cozy exercise \u201ckind of a genius idea,\u201d says Catherine Sanderson, a professor of psychology at Amherst College in Massachusetts and author of \u201cThe Positive Shift: Mastering Mindset to Improve Happiness, Health, and Longevity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt fits in with a lot of what we know about how to get people to actually maintain behavior change,\u201d Sanderson says.</p><p>Along with removing the barriers to exercise, she says, \u201cit very much relies on what psychologists would call positive reinforcement \u2014 the idea of, \u2019It\u2019s not just that I\u2019m exercising. I\u2019m getting to watch my favorite show. I\u2019m tapping into something I want to be doing already.\u201d</p><hl2>ELIMINATE THE COMPETITION \u2014 BY STAYING HOME</hl2><p>The cozy approach also works for gymgoers who feel burned out at the idea of constant striving.</p><p>Ko Im, a mental health advocate who has taught yoga and meditation in New York and other U.S. cities, remembers a phase several years ago when \u201cyoga challenges\u201d were a trend.</p><p>\u201cIt was the yoga pose of the day \u2014 really, really hard yoga poses,\u201d Im says. More recently, she sees people pushing themselves to make the leaderboard in all their Peloton classes or to lose five more pounds.</p><p>\u201cWhat I like,\u201d she says, \u201cis the idea of enjoying the journey, not the goal. Does it feel good in my body today?\u201d</p><p>As cozy cardio gains traction, Zuckerbrow hears from people who didn\u2019t realize they could enjoy the journey.</p><p>Alyssa Royse, owner of Rocket Community Fitness in Seattle, has been alternating between full-on workouts at her gym and cozy exercise at home. Some days she switches off the sound on her Peloton (\u201cI don\u2019t even want those cheery people talking to me\u201d) and just pedals while watching \u201cthe trashiest TV I can find, because it just takes my brain somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>The hashtag-friendly name \u201ccozy cardio\u201d could sound like an oxymoron. But perhaps, as 2024 takes root, it\u2019s the compromise our culture needs.</p><p>Driving across town in icy weather and pushing through an hour of Zumba or lifting 20-pound kettlebells just isn\u2019t possible some days. But lighting a candle in your living room and walking three miles in your pajamas while re-watching the final season of \u201cSuccession\u201d? That\u2019s within reach.</p><p>And it might just serve up enough endorphins and bring enough oxygen into your lungs to cope with whatever global crisis tomorrow could bring.</p><p>\u201cToo many people look at exercise as an all-or-nothing thing,\u201d Royse says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t give people room to just be where they are today. And I think that\u2019s incredibly important.\u201d</p>",
