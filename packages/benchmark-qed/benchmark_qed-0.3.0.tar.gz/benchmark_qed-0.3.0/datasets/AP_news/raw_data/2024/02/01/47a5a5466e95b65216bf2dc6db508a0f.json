That's according to the first U.S. study to assess how well the updated shots work. The shots became available last year and are designed to better protect against more recent coronavirus variants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday released a study of how well the vaccine has worked since then. The finding is similar to what\u2019s been reported in other countries. It's also similar to what was reported for earlier versions of the vaccines.",

The latest CDC data suggests only about 22% of U.S. adults have gotten the shots, and only 11% of children.
