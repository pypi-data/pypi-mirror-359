That gender disparity has baffled scientists for decades but new research may finally explain why. Females have two X chromosomes and Stanford University researchers say how cells handle that extra X can be a red flag for the immune system, essentially an early risk factor. The findings, published Thursday in the journal Cell, could lead to better ways to detect autoimmunity.",

John Wherry, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.</p><p>More than 24 million Americans, by some estimates up to 50 million, have an autoimmune disorder \u2014 diseases such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and dozens more. About 4 of every 5 patients are women, a mystery that has baffled scientists for decades.</p><p>One theory is that the X chromosome might be a culprit. After all, females have two X chromosomes while males have one X and one Y.</p><p>The new research, published in the journal Cell, shows that extra X is involved \u2014 but in an unexpected way.</p><p>Our DNA is carried inside each cell in 23 pairs of chromosomes, including that final pair that determines biological sex. The X chromosome is packed with hundreds of genes, far more than males\u2019 much smaller Y chromosome. Every female cell must switch off one of its X chromosome copies, to avoid getting a toxic double dose of all those genes.</p><p>Performing that so-called X-chromosome inactivation is a special type of RNA called Xist, pronounced like \u201cexist.\u201d This long stretch of RNA parks itself in spots along a cell's extra X chromosome, attracts proteins that bind to it in weird clumps, and silences the chromosome.</p><p>Stanford dermatologist Dr. Howard Chang was exploring how Xist does its job when his lab identified nearly 100 of those stuck-on proteins. Chang recognized many as related to skin-related autoimmune disorders \u2014 patients can have \u201cautoantibodies\u201d that mistakenly attack those normal proteins.</p><p>\u201cThat got us thinking: These are the known ones. What about the other proteins in Xist?\u201d Chang said. Maybe this molecule, found only in women, \u201ccould somehow organize proteins in such a way as to activate the immune system.\u201d</p><p>If true, Xist by itself couldn\u2019t cause autoimmune disease or all women would be affected. Scientists have long thought it takes a combination of genetic susceptibility and an environmental trigger, such as an infection or injury, for the immune system to run amok. For example, the Epstein-Barr virus is linked to multiple sclerosis.</p><p>Chang\u2019s team decided to engineer male lab mice to artificially make Xist \u2014 without silencing their only X chromosome \u2014 and see what happened.</p><p>Researchers also specially bred mice susceptible to a lupus-like condition that can be triggered by a chemical irritant.</p><p>The mice that produced Xist formed its hallmark protein clumps and, when triggered, developed lupus-like autoimmunity at levels similar to females, the team concluded.</p><p>\u201cWe think that\u2019s really important, for Xist RNA to leak out of the cell to where the immune system gets to see it. You still needed this environmental trigger to cause the whole thing to kick off,\u201d explained Chang, who is paid by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which also supports The Associated Press\u2019 Health and Science Department.</p><p>Beyond mice, researchers also examined blood samples from 100 patients \u2014 and uncovered autoantibodies targeting Xist-associated proteins that scientists hadn't previously linked to autoimmune disorders. A potential reason, Chang suggests: standard tests for autoimmunity were made using male cells.</p><p>Lots more research is necessary but the findings \u201cmight give us a shorter path to diagnosing patients that look clinically and immunologically quite different,\u201d said Penn\u2019s Wherry.</p><p>\u201cYou may have autoantibodies to Protein A and another patient may have autoantibodies to Proteins C and D,\u201d but knowing they\u2019re all part of the larger Xist complex allows doctors to better hunt disease patterns, he added. \u201cNow we have at least one big part of the puzzle of biological context.\u201d</p><p>Stanford\u2019s Chang wonders if it may even be possible to one day interrupt the process.</p><p>\u201cHow does that go from RNA to abnormal cells, this will be a next step of the investigation.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
