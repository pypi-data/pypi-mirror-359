New York Attorney General Letitia James said Thursday that Publicis Health engaged in predatory and deceptive marketing strategies to help Purdue Pharma increase sales of its drugs. It is the first ad agency with a major settlement over opioids in the United States. Also Thursday, the drugmaker Hikma announced a settlement of opioid claims with several states. Both companies say the settlements are not admissions of wrongdoing.",

While the formulation made it harder to break down the drug for users to get a faster high, it did not make the pills any less addictive.</p><p>Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said the company provided physicians with digital recorders so Publicis and Purdue could analyze conversations that the prescribers had with patients about taking opioids.</p><p>As part of the settlement, Publicis agreed to release internal documents detailing its work for Purdue and other companies that made opioids.</p><p>The company said in a statement that the settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing and noted that most of the work subject to the settlement was done by Rosetta, a company owned by Publicis that closed 10 years ago.</p><p>\u201cRosetta\u2019s role was limited to performing many of the standard advertising services that agencies provide to their clients, for products that are to this day prescribed to patients, covered by major private insurers, Medicare, and authorized by State Pharmacy Boards,\u201d Publicis said.</p><p>The company also reaffirmed its policy of not taking new work on opioid-related products.</p><p>Publicis added that the company's insurers are reimbursing it for $130 million and that $7 million of the settlement amount will be used for states' legal fees.</p><p>London-based Hikma also said its settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-health-lawsuits-opioids-88be1611993f38d7b7b22147af5881fd\">Drugmakers, wholesalers</a>, pharmacies, at least one <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mckinsey-pay-600-million-opioid-crisis-067a1974efb31cd23809513c632ceca2\">consulting company</a> and a health data firm have agreed to settlements over opioids with U.S. federal, state and local governments totaling <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/opioids-settlement-money-recovery-addiction-d186d72250f35056892bc9d70b5ab2c3\">more than $50 billion</a>.</p><p>One of the largest individual proposed settlements is between state and local governments and Connecticut-based Purdue Pharma. As part of the deal, members of the Sackler family who own the company would contribute up to $6 billion, plus give up ownership. The <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-opioid-purdue-pharma-oxycontin-bankruptcy-df2843c77fa46d8a4752d4fe43745f0f\">U.S. Supreme Court</a> is weighing whether it's appropriate to shield family members from civil lawsuits as part of the deal.</p><p>The opioid crisis has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans in three waves.</p><p>The first began after OxyContin hit the market in 1996 and was linked mostly to prescription opioids, many of them generics. By about 2010, as there were crackdowns on overprescribing and black-market pills, heroin deaths increased dramatically. Most recently, opioids have been linked to more than 80,000 deaths a year, more than ever before. Most involve illicitly produced fentanyl and other potent lab-produced drugs.</p>",
