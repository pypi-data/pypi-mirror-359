The Judiciary Committee voted 6-5 Thursday in favor of the proposal with all Democrats in support and all Republicans in opposition. Democrats control both chambers of the Legislature but lack big-enough majorities to send the proposed amendment to voters unless they convince some Republicans to vote in favor of amending the Maine Constitution. Maine Democrats are seeking to join four other states that have amended their constitutions to protect the right to abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
