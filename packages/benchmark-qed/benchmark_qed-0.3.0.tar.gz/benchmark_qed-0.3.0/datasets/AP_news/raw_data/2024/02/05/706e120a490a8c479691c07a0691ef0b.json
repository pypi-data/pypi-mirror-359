Dr. Roy Schoenberg says the next frontier involves connecting patients more routinely with regular doctors and using artificial intelligence to keep tabs on their health. He\u2019s seeing this develop as co-CEO of Amwell, a Boston-based company that provides software and technology for health systems and insurers to offer telemedicine. The company works with more than 55 health plans and health systems representing over 2,000 hospitals.",

The company works with more than 55 health plans and health systems representing over 2,000 hospitals.</p><p>Schoenberg spoke recently with The Associated Press. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.</p><hl2>Q: The COVID-19 pandemic pushed people into telemedicine. Did that lead to any permanent care delivery changes?</hl2><p>A: In a very profound way. We\u2019re just beginning to unravel how deep the impact is. When people started buying books on Amazon, they didn\u2019t notice that they were beginning to embrace online retail. We\u2019re going through the same thing with telehealth. People have opened the door for getting care through technology.</p><hl2>Q: What is some care patients seek in-person now that you expect will become largely virtual in the future?</hl2><p>A: Early generations of telehealth have really been about convenience \u2026 how a patient can quickly get a simple prescription or solve a problem with a sick child. The revolution that\u2019s going on right now is where people are beginning to utilize these technologies to interact with their regular caretakers. These are regularly scheduled appointments. Patients with very difficult conditions like cancer and deep chronic conditions are becoming the frequent flyers of telehealth. That\u2019s going to continue to evolve.</p><hl2>Q: What\u2019s the biggest way your technology uses artificial intelligence?</hl2><p>A: AI is not in any position to replace clinicians. However, these technologies can help check on a patient regularly. If you have a patient who was discharged from a hospital or has a chronic condition at home \u2026 we can check every day to see how they\u2019re doing. If the patient is not doing well, (the technology) will have the smarts to escalate that patient right back in front of (a nurse or doctor). You get a text message that begins the interaction. It switches over to a secure platform, essentially an application on your phone.</p><hl2>Q: You\u2019re co-CEO with your brother Ido. How do you handle disagreements?</hl2><p>A: Ido is focused on business making. My heart is about developing technologies that solve big problems in care. We respect the fact that each of us has his own special skills. When disagreements arise \u2026 the right decision-maker is whoever really is proficient in that domain. We\u2019ve been doing this for 30 years now.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
