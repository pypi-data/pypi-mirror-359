The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling Monday in two related cases stemming from lawsuits against officials in Freehold and Cranford, New Jersey. The suits revolved around claims that school boards retaliated against the plaintiffs because they refused to wear masks during public meetings. In one of the suits, the court sent the case back to a lower court for consideration. In the other, it said the plaintiff failed to show she was retaliated against.",

(AP) \u2014 A federal appeals court shot down claims Monday that New Jersey residents' refusal to wear face masks at school board meetings during the COVID-19 outbreak constituted protected speech under the First Amendment.</p><p>The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling in two related cases stemming from lawsuits against officials in Freehold and Cranford, New Jersey.</p><p>The suits revolved around claims that the plaintiffs were retaliated against by school boards because they refused to wear masks during public meetings. In one of the suits, the court sent the case back to a lower court for consideration. In the other, it said the plaintiff failed to show she was retaliated against.</p><p>Still, the court found that refusing to wear a mask during a public health emergency didn't amount to free speech protected by the Constitution.</p><p>\u201cA question shadowing suits such as these is whether there is a First Amendment right to refuse to wear a protective mask as required by valid health and safety orders put in place during a recognized public health emergency. Like all courts to address this issue, we conclude there is not,\u201d the court said.</p><p>The court added: \u201cSkeptics are free to \u2014 and did \u2014 voice their opposition through multiple means, but disobeying a masking requirement is not one of them. One could not, for example, refuse to pay taxes to express the belief that \u2018taxes are theft.\u2019 Nor could one refuse to wear a motorcycle helmet as a symbolic protest against a state law requiring them.\u201d</p><p>Ronald Berutti, an attorney for the appellants, said they intend to petition the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case.</p><p>The lawsuits were filed by George Falcone and Gwyneth Murray-Nolan.</p><p>Falcone attended a Freehold Township school board meeting in early 2022 when masks were still required. He refused, according to the court's ruling, and was issued a summons on a trespassing charge. He also alleged a later school board meeting was canceled in retaliation for his not wearing a mask. A lower court found he didn't have standing to bring the suit, and he appealed.</p><p>Murray-Nolan, who had testified before lawmakers on her skepticism toward the efficacy of masking, attended an early 2022 Cranford school board meeting without a mask despite a requirement for them. Less than a month later at the board's next meeting, she was arrested on a defiant trespass charge after attending without a mask. A lower court found officers had probable cause to arrest her because she failed to wear a mask as required under the law at the time. She appealed.</p><p>Eric Harrison, an attorney for the officials named in the suit, lauded the ruling on Tuesday. In an emailed statement he said that refusing to wear a mask in violation of a public health mandate \u201cis not the sort of \u2018civil disobedience\u2019 that the drafters of the First Amendment had in mind as protected speech.\u201d</p><p>New Jersey's statewide order for public masking in schools <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-education-new-jersey-ce67cdfe4373407645fbfb5223051dcd#:~:text=coexist%20with%20it.-,New%20Jersey%20Gov.,state%20mandate%20ends%20March%207.\">ended in March 2022</a>, shortly after the incidents described in the suits.</p>",
