Census Bureau Director Robert Santos said Tuesday that the bureau plans to meet with advocates in the disability community and determine what changes to questions on its American Community Survey are needed to better capture the range of disabilities. He says the bureau also will keep the current questions about disabilities on the 2025 American Community Survey. Disability advocates had complained the changes would artificially reduce their numbers.",

They also argued that they weren't properly consulted on such a major overhaul.</p><p>\u201cGood news. Good news. Good news,\u201d said Scott Landes, an associate professor of sociology at Syracuse University, who is visually impaired. \u201cThey got the message that we need to engage.\u201d</p><p>The bureau plans to meet with advocates in the disability community and determine what changes to the questions are needed to better capture the range of disabilities while keeping the current questions about disability on the 2025 American Community Survey, said Census Bureau Director Robert Santos.</p><p>\u201cWe will continue our work with stakeholders and the public to better understand data needs on disability and assess which, if any, revisions are needed across the federal statistical system to better address those needs,\u201d Santos said in a blog post.</p><p>The American Community Survey is the most comprehensive survey of American life, covering commuting times, internet access, family life, income, education levels, disabilities and military service, among other topics.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/methodology/questionnaires/2023/quest23.pdf\">existing questions</a> ask respondents to answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d if they have difficulty or \u201cserious difficulty\u201d seeing, even with glasses, or are blind; hearing, or are deaf; concentrating, remembering or making decisions because of a physical, mental or emotional condition; walking or climbing stairs; dressing or bathing; or performing everyday tasks because of a physical, mental or emotional condition. If the answer is \u2033yes,\u201d they are counted as having a disability.</p><p>Under the proposed changes, which follow international standards, respondents would be allowed to answer most of the same questions with four choices: \u201cno difficulty,\u201d \u201csome difficulty,\u201d \u201ca lot of difficulty\u201d and \u201ccannot do at all.\u201d A person would be counted as disabled if they answered \u201ccannot do at all\u201d or \u201ca lot of difficulty\u201d for any task or function. The changes also would have added a query on whether respondents have trouble communicating.</p><p>Supporters of the proposed changes said the revisions would have provided more nuanced data and given officials better details about disabilities that can inform how services or resources are provided.</p><p>In a test run, the percentage of respondents who were defined as having a disability went from 13.9% using the current questions to 8.1% under the proposed changes. When the definition was expanded to also include \u201csome difficulty,\u201d it grew to 31.7%.</p><p>The proposed changes to the disability questions were among several tweaks to the American Community Survey that the Census Bureau was planning to submit this year for approval to the Office of Management and Budget. As part of that process, the Census Bureau solicited public feedback and got more than 12,000 responses, with the majority expressing concerns about changes to the disability questions.</p><p>Advocates said Tuesday that they will be focused on working with the bureau on coming up with questions that capture the range of disabilities, including people with mental health problems, developmental disabilities or chronic health conditions, such as those faced by many people living with long COVID.</p><p>\u201cWhile this is a win for our community, we must stay committed to the long-term goal of developing better disability questions that are more equitable and inclusive of our community,\u201d Bonnielin Swenor, director of the Johns Hopkins Disability Health Research Center, said in an email.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Mike Schneider on X, formerly known as Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeSchneiderAP\">@MikeSchneiderAP</a>.</p>",

While the primary focus is on the methodology of data collection and the implications for the disabled community, it does touch on health-related aspects such as the impact on resources for housing, schools, and program benefits for people with disabilities, including those with chronic health conditions like long COVID. However, the main emphasis is on the survey process and the backlash rather than health itself."
