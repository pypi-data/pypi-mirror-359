The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made the announcement Tuesday. Rizo-Lopez Foods of Modesto, California, has recalled more than 60 types of soft cheeses, sour cream and yogurt after the bacteria was found in a product. At least 26 people in 11 states have been sickened since 2014. Two people died in Texas and California. The CDC previously investigated the outbreak in 2017 and 2021.",

The strain of listeria linked to the outbreak was found in a cheese sample from Rizo-Lopez Foods. Federal officials confirmed that queso fresco and cotija made by the company were making people sick.</p><p>The recalled products were distributed nationwide at stores and retail deli counters, including El Super, Cardenas Market, Northgate Gonzalez, Superior Groceries, El Rancho, Vallarta, Food City, La Michoacana, and Numero Uno Markets.</p><p>Listeria infections can cause serious illness and, in rare cases, death. People who are pregnant, older than 65 or have weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable. Symptoms \u2014 like muscle aches, fever and tiredness \u2014 usually start within two weeks after eating contaminated foods, but can start earlier or later.</p><p>The CDC said consumers who have these products should discard them and thoroughly clean the refrigerator, counters and other contact sites. Listeria can survive in the refrigerator and easily contaminate other foods and surfaces.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
