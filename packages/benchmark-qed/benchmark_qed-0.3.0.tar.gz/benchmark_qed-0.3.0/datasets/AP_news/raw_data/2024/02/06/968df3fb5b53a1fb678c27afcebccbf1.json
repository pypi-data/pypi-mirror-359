A legislative committee held an hourslong meeting Monday on whether to sell Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana to the for-profit giant Elevance Health, which is based in Indiana and is one of the nation's largest insurers. Policyholders have been split on the proposed sale. Some fear that under Elevance they could see increases in their premiums while others argue that the sale would mean improved services.",
