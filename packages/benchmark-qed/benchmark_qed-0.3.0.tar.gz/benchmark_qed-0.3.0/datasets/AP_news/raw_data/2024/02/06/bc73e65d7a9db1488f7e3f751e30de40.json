State senators passed the bill Tuesday and the measure now advances to the House. The bill\u2019s author, state Sen. Gary Byrne, said the bill increases local control over school topics. Democrats, who are in the minority in both chambers of the General Assembly, say the bill takes control away from teachers and parents and does not adequately define \u201chuman sexuality,\u201d a term at the heart of the measure.",

It now moves to the House for consideration, where Republicans also hold a supermajority.</p><p>The bill would require school boards to approve by July 1 all materials used to instruct students on \u201chuman sexuality,\u201d author of the bill and state Sen. Gary Byrne told lawmakers Tuesday. Byrne told senators he intended to make sex education more transparent for parents.</p><p>Schools would also be required to post a list of the materials to their websites and the board must approve what age students will receive instruction, whether students will be taught in a co-ed setting and whether the lesson will be provided by a male or female instructor.</p><p>According to a state <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/indiana-governor-transgender-students-book-bans-b3662d950080cf43965bce58692bfc70\">law</a> passed last year, instruction on \u201chuman sexuality\u201d already is prohibited from prekindergarten through the third grade.</p><p>\u201cAs a former school board member, I think putting the local school boards in the driver\u2019s seat on this issue makes good sense,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cAnd they are elected by the voters.\u201d</p><p>However, the bill does not define \u201chuman sexuality,\" and Byrne said the definition would be left to school boards. Democratic state Sen. J.D. Ford warned that ambiguity could have a negative impact on LGBTQ+ students if the definition is not defined by the state.</p><p>\u201cThis bill, simply put, allows Moms for Liberty direct access to see what\u2019s going on so they can go to their local boards and fuss at them,\u201d Ford said.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/moms-for-liberty-carmel-indiana-hamilton-county-437136c699ae3f991d7279836d2998bc?taid=653de73ad6113200014dbbf0&utm_campaign=TrueAnthem&utm_medium=AP&utm_source=Twitter\">Moms for Liberty</a> is a national conservative group known for challenging curriculum such as material on LGBTQ+; diversity, equity and inclusion and racial justice topics and working to pack local school boards with its endorsements.</p><p>Democrats, who are in the super minority in the Senate, objected to placing school board members in control of material rather than educators and parents. Byrne said the law increases local control rather than establishing statewide mandates on the topic.</p>",
