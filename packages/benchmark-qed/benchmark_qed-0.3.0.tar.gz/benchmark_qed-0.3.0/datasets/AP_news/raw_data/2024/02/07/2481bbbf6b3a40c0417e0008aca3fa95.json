The health care giant said Wednesday that it was scaling back an already cautious view of 2024 as the company tries to understand why costs keep rising from the privately run version of the government\u2019s Medicare program. Medicare Advantage plans mostly cover people who are age 65 and older. CVS Health has about 3.4 million people in that business through its Aetna arm. CVS Health said Wednesday those costs were coming from outpatient care like hip and knee surgeries and dental and vision coverage.",

Humana <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/humana-medicare-advantage-higher-costs-f0fe0eab945bebd1489ab083c3a54d6d\">said late last month</a> that more of its customers had been admitted for short hospital stays than it had expected.</p><p>Chief Financial Officer Thomas Cowhey told analysts on Wednesday that CVS Health was \u201cprudently assuming\u201d these higher costs would persist in 2024.</p><p>The company now expects earnings adjusted for one-time items to total at least $8.30 per share in 2024.</p><p>That\u2019s well below the Wall Street consensus of $8.47 per share, according to the data firm FactSet.</p><p>It also falls 20 cents short of what CVS predicted at its annual investor presentation in December.
