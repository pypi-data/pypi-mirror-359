    "description_summary": "Schools are confronting soaring absence rates. Some are calling for parents to send their children to class even if they are not feeling 100% well. During the pandemic, schools urged parents and children to stay home at any sign of illness. Now that the COVID-19 emergency has ended, guidance on when to keep children home varies widely. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends staying home with fever, vomiting or diarrhea, or when students \u201care not well enough to participate in class.\u201d But many districts go far beyond that, delineating a dizzying array of symptoms they say should rule out attendance.",

Dorsey-Hollins followed school guidelines and kept her home when she had a cough or a sore throat \u2014 or worse \u2014 until she was completely better.</p><p>Near the end of the year, the school in Fort Worth, Texas, called her in to talk about why her daughter had <a href=\"https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/missing-students-chronic-absenteeism/index.html\">missed so much school</a>.</p><p>During the pandemic, schools urged parents and children to stay home at any sign of illness. Even though the emergency has ended, she said no one has clarified that those rules have changed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s extremely confusing,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIn the past, if the child didn\u2019t have a fever over 100, then it\u2019s okay to send them to school,\u201d said the mother of a 5- and 13-year-old. \u201cBut now it\u2019s like if they have a cough or they\u2019re sneezing, you might want to keep them home. Which is it?\u201d</p><p>Widely varying guidance on when to keep children home has only added to the confusion, which many see as a factor in the <a href=\"https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/missing-students-chronic-absenteeism/index.html\">nationwide epidemic of chronic school absences</a>. Some advocates and school systems \u2014 and the state of California \u2014 are now encouraging kids to come to class even when they have the sniffles or other nuisance illnesses like lice or pinkeye.</p><p>Families need to hear they no longer must keep kids home at any sign of illness, said Hedy Chang, the executive director of Attendance Works. The national nonprofit aimed at improving attendance has issued its own guidance, urging parents to send kids to school <a href=\"https://www.attendanceworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Health_Guidance_Handout_2023_AW_080723.pdf\">if they can participate in daily activities</a>.</p><p>\u201cWe have to now re-engage kids and families and change their thinking about that,\u201d Chang said.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/school/Pages/When-to-Keep-Your-Child-Home-from-School.aspx\">recommends staying home</a> when there\u2019s fever, vomiting or diarrhea, or when students \u201care not well enough to participate in class.\u201d</p><p>But many districts go far beyond that, delineating a dizzying array of symptoms they say should rule out attendance. Fort Worth Independent School District, where Dorsey-Hollins\u2019 youngest daughter attends kindergarten, advises staying home if a child has a cough, sore throat or rash. A student should be \u201cfever-free\u201d for 24 hours without medication before returning to school, per district guidelines.</p><p>Austin Independent School District in Texas lists \u201ceye redness,\u201d \u201cundetermined rash\u201d or \u201copen, draining lesions\u201d as reasons to stay home. <a href=\"https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/health-and-wellness/staying-healthy/head-lice\">Kids with lice can\u2019t attend</a> class in New York City schools. Maryland\u2019s Montgomery County recommends keeping a child <a href=\"https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/HHS-Program/PHS/SchoolHealth/KeepingYourChildHome.html\">home with a stomachache</a>, \u201cpale or flushed face\u201d or \u201cthick yellow discharge from the nose.\u201d</p><p>Finding the right balance is difficult, and it\u2019s understandable that different places would approach it differently, said Claire McCarthy, a pediatrician at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical School.</p><p>\u201cEach school or school district has a different tolerance for illness,\u201d said McCarthy.</p><p>It all leaves many parents feeling puzzled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a struggle,\u201d said Malika Elwin, a mother of a second grader on New York\u2019s Long Island.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t want to expose other children or burden the teacher with her daughter\u2019s runny nose, so she\u2019s kept her daughter home longer even though she\u2019s feeling better because she still has cold symptoms. \u201cThen I regret that because she just runs around here all day perfectly fine,\u201d she said.</p><p>For those who test positive for COVID-19, the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html\">CDC still calls for staying home</a> and isolating for at least five days. But guidance from states and individual schools varies widely. In some school systems, guidance allows for students who test positive to go to school as long as they are asymptomatic.</p><p>Trenace Dorsey-Hollins said it is hard for parents like her to keep track.</p><p>\u201cIs it actually OK to sit in school with a cough if you don\u2019t have a fever and haven\u2019t tested positive for COVID?\u201d she said.</p><p>When schools closed during the pandemic, kids <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-education-covid-46cb725e08110f8ad3c1b303ec9eefad\">fell behind academically</a> \u2014 and continued chunks of school absences have made it harder for them to catch up. So some authorities have re-evaluated their tolerance for illness. During the 2021-2022 school year, more than a quarter of students <a href=\"https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/missing-students-chronic-absenteeism/index.html\">missed at least 10% of the school year</a>, up from 15% before the pandemic.</p><p>Missing that much school puts students at risk of not <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/reading-third-grade-phonics-bd9a14dd348d88c2b11e2dce38829a8e\">learning to read</a> or <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/high-school-graduation-rate-boys-c7b8dff33221e0ded2d1369397d96455\">graduate</a>. Absent students also lose out on meals, socialization with peers and caring adults, physical exercise, and access to mental health counseling and health care. In other words, missing school has its own health effects.</p><p>And when a class sees high levels of chronic absenteeism, it hurts the students who are there because a teacher has to spend time reorienting the students who\u2019ve been away.</p><p>The state of California, where 25% of students last year missed 10% of the school year, took a new approach to sick-day guidance this fall. Instead of only saying when a child should stay home, the guidance describes circumstances when a child might be slightly unwell but can come to school.</p><p>Overall, students should stay home when their symptoms \u201cprevent them from participating meaningfully in routine activities.\u201d But coming to school with diarrhea is all right as long as a child can make it to the toilet in time. Going to school with mild cold symptoms, sore throat, mild rash or pinkeye are all \u201cOK.\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s more, California doesn\u2019t insist on waiting 24 hours after a fever or vomiting before returning to school. Going fever-free or without vomiting overnight is enough.</p><p>Boston Public Schools took a similar stance in its online recommendations for parents. \u201cRespiratory infections are common,\u201d reads the online guidance. \u201cIf the child does not have fever, does not appear to have decreased activity or other symptoms, it is not necessary for the child to stay home.\u201d</p><p>The shift in guidance could have a disproportionate impact on low-income communities and people of color, said Noha Aboelata, who leads the Roots Community Health Center in Oakland, California. People in those communities might be more likely to live in multigenerational homes, take crowded public transportation or have poor ventilation in their homes, she said. When people are out and about while sick, vulnerable loved ones could be put at risk.</p><p>She had hoped the pandemic\u2019s lessons about staying home when contagious and taking care of yourself and your family when sick would outlast the public health emergency. Instead, she said, \u201cit feels like the pendulum is swinging fiercely back in the other direction.\"</p><p>But changing the culture around school absences goes beyond just issuing guidance.</p><p>Some schools in San Diego County seem unaware of California's new guidance allowing kids to attend school while mildly sick, said Tracy Schmidt, who oversees attendance for the county Office of Education.</p><p>Still, others have adopted and it and have begun talking through symptoms with parents who call to report their children are sick, urging them to bring them in and see how it goes. It gives her hope that as more schools and parents learn about this guidance, students will miss less school.</p><p>\u201cThe most important place for our kids to be is school,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to leave behind this mindset that we had to adopt during the pandemic because we were in a public safety emergency.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press\u2019 education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.
