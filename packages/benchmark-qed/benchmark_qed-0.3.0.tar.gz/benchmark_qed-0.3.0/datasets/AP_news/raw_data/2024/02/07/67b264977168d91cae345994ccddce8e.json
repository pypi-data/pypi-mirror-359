But the pills have to be taken right away, so you must get tested, obtain a prescription and get the medication within five days of symptoms appearing. The medication is intended for those with mild or moderate COVID-19 who are more likely to become seriously ill. To get the pills, you can contact your health care provider, use test-to-treat site or sign up for the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Home Test to Treat program.",

It has a list price around $1,400, but most people shouldn\u2019t have to pay that amount. The drug is free through the end of 2024 for people on federal insurance programs like Medicaid and Medicare. Uninsured people also can get it for free.</p><p>However, you must go through a patient assistance program run by Pfizer to get the discount. People on commercial insurance with high out-of-pocket costs can also get financial help through a separate co-pay assistance program.
