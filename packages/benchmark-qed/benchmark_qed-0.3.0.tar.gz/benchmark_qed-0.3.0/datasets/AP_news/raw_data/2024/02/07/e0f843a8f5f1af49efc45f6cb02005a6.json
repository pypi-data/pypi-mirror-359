    "description_summary": "The war in Gaza has sparked a humanitarian catastrophe that has prompted shortages of the most basic necessities. Among those hardest hit are babies, young children and their parents. Diapers and baby formula are hard to find or have become unaffordable as prices spike. Parents are looking to inadequate or even unsafe alternatives, such as giving solid food to infants younger than 6 months old. Aid deliveries are sporadic, hobbled by Israeli restrictions and the relentless fighting. Aid agencies say children's needs in the war-torn territory far exceed the aid that's coming in.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) \u2014 Zainab al-Zein was forced to make a desperate decision: Feed her infant daughter solid foods that her tiny body may not be able to digest or watch her starve because of a lack of baby formula in the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\">besieged Gaza Strip.</a></p><p>Al-Zein chose to give 2 1/2-month-old Linda solids, knowing the choice could lead to health issues.</p><p>\u201cI know we are doing something harmful to her, but there is nothing,\u201d said al-Zein, feeding her wailing daughter crushed biscuits in the cold tent they now call home. \u201cShe cries and cries continuously.\u201d</p><p>The war between Israel and Gaza's Hamas rulers has sparked a humanitarian catastrophe that has brought shortages of the most basic necessities. Some of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/women-children-gaza-war-victims-un-inequality-f0f89a724543b99c2c22439e7af09405\">the hardest-hit</a> are babies, young children and their parents, with diapers and formula either hard to find or spiking to unaffordable prices, leading parents to resort to inadequate or even unsafe alternatives.</p><p>Their plight is further complicated due to sporadic aid deliveries that have been hobbled by Israeli restrictions and the relentless fighting.</p><p>Displaced Palestinians are also being squeezed into ever tighter areas of the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-hamas-war-90e02d26420b8fe3157f73c256f9ed6a\">tiny coastal enclave</a>, prompting outbreaks of illness and disease, to which malnourished children are particularly vulnerable. The U.N. says the population is at imminent risk of famine, with a quarter of people already starving.</p><p>For Palestinians enduring increasingly dire conditions, the most basic of acts \u2014 such as changing a child\u2019s diaper \u2014 have become a luxury that can require sacrifice.</p><p>\u201cI sold my children\u2019s food so I can buy diapers,\u201d said Raafat Abu Wardeh, who has two children in diapers.</p><p>Aid is not reaching everyone, and shortages of basic goods have caused prices to skyrocket. With Gaza's economy decimated, few Palestinians have regular incomes and most are either depleting their savings or subsisting on handouts.</p><p>At makeshift street stalls, older children working as hawkers sell individual diapers for three to five shekels ($1 to $1.50) or entire packs for up to 170 shekels ($46). A pack of diapers before the war cost 12 shekels ($3.50).</p><p>\u201cThe prices of diapers are very ridiculous,\u201d said Anis al-Zein, who was buying them along a street in central Deir al-Balah and is not related to Zainab. \u201cA child costs you 20 shekels ($5) a day. Especially in a bad situation like this, all prices are high and there is no income for people. There isn\u2019t even aid.\u201d</p><p>Some parents are using cloth diapers, but those require washing with water, which is also scarce.</p><p>Mohammed al-Khatib, the local program manager for the U.K.-based Medical Aid for Palestinians, said some people have been forced to buy smaller diapers and tape them together.</p><p>Lack of fresh produce, the proliferation of unregulated food stalls and cold weather has contributed to the spread of illness, including respiratory infections, skin rashes and diarrhea. \u201cIt is winter, and the kids are wet most of the time,\u201d al-Khatib said.</p><p>The war, triggered by the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-rockets-airstrikes-tel-aviv-11fb98655c256d54ecb5329284fc37d2\">deadly Oct. 7 Hamas assault</a> on southern Israel, has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-war-southern-gaza-humanitarian-conditions-4da8410ab2e849adef8aff18c79b310c\">unleashed unimaginable destruction,</a> with more than 27,000 Palestinians killed and close to 67,000 wounded in Israel\u2019s offensive, according to local health officials.</p><p>The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza does not differentiate in its count between civilians and combatants but says two-thirds of those killed were women and children. Israel blames Hamas for the high death toll because the group carries out attacks and militant activities in residential areas.</p><p>The Hamas attack killed about 1,200 people in Israel, most of them civilians, and roughly 250 were <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-war-hostages-cunio-captivity-869241bb259b00a8f98817edf89b0bc8\">taken hostage.</a></p><p>The lack of diapers has added to the poor sanitary conditions for the estimated 1.7 million displaced Palestinians, many of whom are crammed into overcrowded shelters.</p><p>The United Nations\u2019 children\u2019s agency UNICEF said this week that most of the newly displaced have only 1-2 liters (50-67 ounces) of water a day to drink, cook and wash. It said chronic diarrhea among children was ticking up.</p><p>UNICEF says aid deliveries into Gaza are not meeting the vast needs.</p><p>The agency estimates 20,000 infants up to 6 months old need formula, which UNICEF has been delivering along with necessities that have also included diapers and cash.</p><p>\u201cThis is far from being enough to address the colossal needs of the children in Gaza,\u201d said UNICEF spokesperson Ammar Ammar.</p><p>The needs of infants are part of a broader threat to all 335,000 children in Gaza under 5 years old, who are at high risk of severe malnutrition and preventable death, UNICEF said.</p><p>\u201cFor many families in Gaza, the threat of dying from hunger is already real,\u201d Ammar said.</p><p>The U.N. humanitarian office said Wednesday that recent screenings show that nearly 10% of children under the age of 5 suffer from acute malnutrition, a 12-fold increase from before the war.
