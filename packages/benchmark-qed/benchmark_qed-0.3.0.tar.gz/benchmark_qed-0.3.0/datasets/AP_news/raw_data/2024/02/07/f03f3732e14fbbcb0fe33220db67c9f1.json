The pills' high price and doctors\u2019 hesitation to prescribe them are creating obstacles to getting the drug to everyone who would benefit. The people most likely to benefit from Paxlovid were the least likely to get it in 2022. The study by Harvard researchers found that Paxlovid was disproportionately given to patients with lower risk of severe infection. If it had been properly utilized, the authors concluded, more than 16,000 COVID-19 deaths could have been prevented.",

And yet, an antiviral treatment proven to lessen the chances of severe outcomes is going underused.</p><p>The drug, Paxlovid, is lauded by experts as a powerful tool that can prevent hospitalization and death from COVID-19. But the high price and doctors\u2019 hesitation to prescribe the pills mean the five-day treatment isn\u2019t getting to everyone who would benefit from it.</p><p>\u201cWhen you read in your local newspaper that in this hospital, they\u2019ve got this many COVID patients, most of those are preventable hospitalizations,\u201d said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University who sees Paxlovid as a useful tool to treat COVID-19.</p><p>One Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found that Paxlovid can <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7148e2.htm?s_cid=mm7148e2_w\">decrease hospitalization</a> risks among adults by 51%. The drug is recommended for older people and other adults with certain underlying conditions and can be prescribed for kids as young as 12.</p><p>When Paxlovid was first authorized for emergency use in the U.S. in December 2021, it was free for anyone who needed it. Once the government stopped funding the treatment, Pfizer set a list price <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/covid19-paxlovid-treatment-coronavirus-drugs-5ea6124208e915382c40303bd6d749ef\">of $1,390</a>.</p><p>The drug remains free for people on federal insurance programs like Medicaid and Medicare through the end of this year, and uninsured people also can get it for free. But many of those people must go through a <a href=\"https://paxlovid.iassist.com/\">patient assistance program</a> run by Pfizer to get the discounts. People on commercial insurance with high out-of-pocket costs can also get financial help through a separate co-pay assistance program.</p><p>Independent pharmacy owners find Paxlovid is expensive to carry because of reimbursement rates from commercial insurers, said Kurt Proctor, a senior vice president at the National Community Pharmacists Association.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re losing 5% on a $10 prescription, it\u2019s very different than losing 5% on a $1,400 prescription product,\u201d he said.</p><p>The high list price also is turning off some patients.</p><p>When Celise Ballow, of Junction, Utah, got COVID-19 recently, she never got the medication.</p><p>Ballow said her doctor declined to write her a prescription after telling her it wouldn\u2019t be covered by her insurance. Now she wonders if she could have avoided some of the infection\u2019s worst effects if she had been able to get the medication.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going on a month and a half and I\u2019m still having nebulizer treatments. \u2026 I\u2019m still exhausted,\u201d Ballow said.</p><p>Another factor hurting uptake appears to be the long list of medications that shouldn\u2019t be taken with Paxlovid. Many doctors may simply decide the risk of drug interactions isn\u2019t worth it.</p><p>\u201cIf people are on four or five different medications, it does tend to be a pain to double check \u2018is there an interaction here?\u2019\u201d said Dr. Sarah George, an infectious diseases professor at St. Louis University. Seeing a possible significant drug interaction \u201ctends to put a physician off from prescribing a drug, even if there is a workaround,\u201d she said.</p><p>Paxlovid isn't the only <a href=\"https://aspr.hhs.gov/COVID-19/Treatments/Pages/Possible-Treatment-Options-for-COVID19.aspx\">antiviral medication</a> for COVID-19. Merck\u2019s Lagevrio is another available pill, though it's proven to be less popular in the U.S. than Paxlovid. A third drug, Gilead's Veklury, is given via infusion.</p><p>The people most likely to benefit from Paxlovid were the least likely to get it in 2022, according to a <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2814359?resultClick=1\">recent study.</a></p><p>The study by Harvard researchers found that Paxlovid was disproportionately given to Medicare patients with lower risk of severe infection. If it had been properly utilized, the authors concluded, more than 16,000 COVID-19 deaths could have been prevented.</p><p>Dr. Michael Barnett, a Harvard health policy researcher who co-wrote the study, said it shouldn\u2019t be that way.</p><p>\u201cThere are very few medications and very few patients whose potential medication interaction with Paxlovid is so severe that they\u2019re better off not taking Paxlovid,\u201d he said. \u201cVery few of them are important enough that it\u2019s a big risk to stop for a week.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
