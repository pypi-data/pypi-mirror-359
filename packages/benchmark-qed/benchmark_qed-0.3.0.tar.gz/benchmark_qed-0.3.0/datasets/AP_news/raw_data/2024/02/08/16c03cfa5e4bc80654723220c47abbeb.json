Republican senators on Wednesday voted down a Democratic proposal to allow exceptions for rape and incest under the state's current ban on almost all abortions. Democratic Sen. Tracy McCreery tried to add the amendment to a Republican bill. Missouri in 2022 banned abortion except in cases of medical emergencies. Some Republicans say blocking rape and incest victims from getting abortions was too extreme. One Republican is trying to amend the state constitution to allow abortions in cases of rape, incest and fatal fetal abnormalities until viability.",

(AP) \u2014 Missouri senators on Wednesday voted against amending the state's strict law against abortions to allow exceptions in cases of rape and incest.</p><p>The state banned almost all abortions after the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0\">overturned Roe v. Wade</a>. Abortions currently are only legal \u201cin cases of medical emergency.\u201d</p><p>Democratic state Sen. Tracy McCreery said Missouri's current law goes too far and called on her colleagues to \u201cshow an ounce of compassion\" for victims of rape and incest.</p><p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is, \u2018We don\u2019t care,\u2019\u201d McCreery said of the state's current abortion ban. \u201cWe\u2019re going to force you to give birth, even if that pregnancy resulted from forcible rape by a family member, a date, an ex-husband or a stranger.\u201d</p><p>McCreery tried adding amendments to allow exceptions for abortion in cases of rape and incest to a Republican-sponsored bill that would continue blocking taxpayer funding from going to Planned Parenthood.</p><p>Both of McCreery's amendments were voted down along party lines in the Republican-led Senate, and debate on the underlying bill was cut off before a final vote Wednesday.</p><p>GOP Sen. Rick Brattin said abortion is as much of an atrocity as the institution of slavery and argued that giving birth could help women recover from rape or incest.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to go after the rapist, let\u2019s give him the death penalty. Absolutely, let\u2019s do it,\u201d Brattin said. \u201cBut not the innocent person caught in-between that, by God\u2019s grace, may even be the greatest healing agent you need in which to recover from such an atrocity.\u201d</p><p>Republican Sen. Mike Moon was also in favor of the ban and added to Brattin's comments, calling for rapists to be castrated.</p><p>But some Republicans said that Missouri went too far in its abortion ban.</p><p>St. Louis resident Jamie Corley is leading a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/missouri-abortion-rape-incest-cc4901ed9b9ec6a0ffc9d47e28ce1048\">campaign</a> to amend the state constitution to allow abortions for any reason up to 12 weeks into pregnancy. If Corley's amendment is enacted, abortions would also be allowed in cases of rape, incest and fatal fetal abnormalities until <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-viability-ballot-initiatives-2024-roe-fcf440373973b01f740912cd3bbd98a4\">viability</a>, which typically is around 24 weeks.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-missouri-constitutional-amendment-viability-37e28b7609607ae762626206ea1a72c1\">competing</a> proposal backed by Planned Parenthood and other abortion-rights groups would enshrine the right to abortion in the constitution while allowing the GOP-led Legislature to regulate it after the point of viability.</p>",
