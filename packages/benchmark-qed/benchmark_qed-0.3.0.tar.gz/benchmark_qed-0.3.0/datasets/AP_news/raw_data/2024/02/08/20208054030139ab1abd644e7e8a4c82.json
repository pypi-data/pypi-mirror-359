    "description_summary": "A Republican-led group trying to restore abortion rights in Missouri is ending its campaign. Executive Director Jamie Corley on Thursday announced her moderate abortion-rights campaign is withdrawing to clear the path for a competing, more sweeping proposal. Corley was trying to amend Missouri's constitution to allow abortion up to 12 weeks into pregnancy. After that, abortion would be allowed in cases of rape, incest and fatal fetal abnormalities until viability. With the moderate campaign out of the way, a constitutional amendment backed by Planned Parenthood and other abortion-rights groups has a clearer path forward. The rival proposal seeks to enshrine abortion rights in the constitution while allowing lawmakers to regulate it after viability.",

(AP) \u2014 A <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/missouri-abortion-rape-incest-cc4901ed9b9ec6a0ffc9d47e28ce1048\">Republican-led campaign</a> to restore abortion rights in Missouri ended Thursday, clearing the path for a competing, more <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-missouri-constitutional-amendment-viability-37e28b7609607ae762626206ea1a72c1\">sweeping constitutional amendment</a> to get on the state's November ballot.</p><p>\u201cHaving two initiatives on the ballot would create confusion and potentially split the vote,\u201d Missouri Women and Family Research Fund Executive Director Jamie Corley said in a statement. \u201cNo one wants that, so we have decided to suspend our campaign to amend Missouri's abortion law.\u201d</p><p>Corley's withdrawal means a rival campaign backed by Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri and other abortion-rights groups can move forward without competition. The ballot initiative by Missourians for Constitutional Freedom would enshrine abortion in the state constitution while allowing lawmakers to regulate it after viability.</p><p>Both campaigns had <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-missouri-constitution-voters-election-0d2fdde552c2478b283937a6fab78cfc\">wanted their measures to go straight to voters</a> after a law passed by Missouri's Republican-led Legislature <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-us-supreme-court-missouri-government-and-politics-7bb5798bae32c3f15abad3a10941dfb5\">barring almost all abortions</a> took effect in 2022. Only abortions in cases of \u201cmedical emergencies\u201d are legal in Missouri now.</p><p>Missouri\u2019s Republican lawmakers appear uninterested in relaxing the law. A Democratic effort to allow for exceptions in cases of rape and incest was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/budget-planned-parenthood-abortions-medicaid-missouri-16c03cfa5e4bc80654723220c47abbeb\">voted down</a> along party lines Wednesday in the GOP-led Senate.</p><p>\u201cEvery Republican in the room voted against exceptions for victims of rape and incest,\u201d Senate Democratic Minority Leader John Rizzo said Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s how extreme they\u2019ve become, and that is why the only recourse for everyday Missourians is through the initiative petition process.\u201d</p><p>Voters in seven states \u2014 California, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-primary-elections-kansas-abortion-b6d62a852c2ce4617f2c03589fbb523e\">Kansas</a>, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, Ohio and Vermont \u2014 have sided with abortion rights supporters on ballot measures. Florida\u2019s Republican attorney general <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/florida-abortion-election-2024-17540f14ed2880f03a2bb14274b03ed3\">on Wednesday</a> asked the state Supreme Court to keep a proposed abortion rights amendment <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/florida-abortion-ballot-elections-931be34f9ffdd6d74f6beade05eeee47\">off the ballot.</a></p><p>Under Corley's proposal, abortions would have been allowed for any reason up until 12 weeks into pregnancy in Missouri. Abortions in cases of rape, incest and fatal fetal abnormalities would be allowed until viability.</p><p>Corley had pitched her initiative petition as a moderate alternative that could pass in Missouri, where all statewide elected officials are Republican and abortion-rights groups hold huge sway in state politics.</p><p>She said she's not joining the rival abortion-rights campaign but wants that initiative petition to be approved.</p><p>\u201cI hope it passes,\" she said. \u201cI think they have a very, very tough campaign ahead. I am pretty worried about it.\u201d</p><p>Nonetheless, the campaign appears hopeful. Missourians for Constitutional Freedom spokeswoman Mallory Schwarz in a Thursday statement said the campaign has \u201cgrowing momentum.\u201d Advocates earlier this week kicked off signature gathering events statewide.</p><p>But supporters say that even without a competing ballot measure, the remaining abortion-rights campaign still faces steep obstacles.</p><p>Missourians for Constitutional Freedom's campaign was delayed for months in a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-missouri-ballot-constitution-ruling-edb5f44fc0f9799d01cda22cd1f70b40\">court fight</a> with Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, who is running for governor. GOP lawmakers are trying to raise the threshold for approving <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ballot-initiatives-voters-democracy-2024-602ebb8a74d7ae45163d79c065a23ef0\">constitutional amendments</a> before the November ballot, an effort motivated in part by the abortion-rights campaigns. And an <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-election-missouri-4a42e99351ad6cc555fa4c61fe24ebe5\">anti-abortion campaign</a> called Missouri Stands with Women launched last month with the direct goal of torpedoing any abortion-rights measure.</p><p>\u201cOur coalition was prepared to inform Missourians on why they should decline to sign both pro-abortion petitions,\u201d Missouri Stands with Women spokeswoman Stephanie Bell said in a statement. \u201cSo now we will be working twice as hard to defeat one petition instead of two, while pro-abortion activists remain divided on the issue.\u201d</p><p>Initiative petition groups must collect at least 172,000 voter signatures by May 5 to make it on November\u2019s ballot, another huge undertaking.</p>",
