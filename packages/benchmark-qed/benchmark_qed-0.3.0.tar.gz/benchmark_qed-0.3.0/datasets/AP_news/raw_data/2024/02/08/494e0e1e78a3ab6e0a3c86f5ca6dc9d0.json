The situation has all the hallmarks of a ransomware attack, although officials have not confirmed or denied the cause. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital officials say they are still working with the FBI and other law enforcement but confirmed Thursday that a \u201cknown criminal threat actor\u201d had accessed the hospital\u2019s network. A representative for the FBI in Chicago would not provide further information but has previously confirmed agents are part of the response.",

Such extortion-style attacks are popular among <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-europe-united-states-hacking-319f2fb7dee9d4662299cec3ade3c758\">ransomware gangs</a> seeking financial gain by locking data, records or other critical information, and then demanding money to release it back to the owner.</p><p>Allan Liska, an analyst with cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, said victims often are advised not to name specific criminal groups but said the description Lurie officials provided Thursday suggests it's an operation well known to U.S. law enforcement.</p><p>\u201cEven though we all know most hospitals with some exceptions don't have spare cash to pay a large ransom, they're much more aggressive than they used to be when going after health care providers,\u201d Liska said of ransomware gangs' strategies.</p><p>A representative for the FBI in Chicago would not provide further information on the hospital\u2019s comments, referring The Associated Press to a statement released Wednesday confirming an ongoing investigation.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services warned in a report last year that health care providers have increasingly been targeted by criminals, causing <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ransomware-attack-hospitals-emergency-rooms-0841defe1b881b71eccb8826ed46130e\">delayed or disrupted care</a> for patients across the country.</p><p>But <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/schools-ransomware-data-breach-40ebeda010158f04a1ef14607bfed9b0\">schools</a>, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kansas-courts-cybersecurity-problem-network-offline-ba6c2c1979fd58869cc5d4fb1aed501c\">courts</a>, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/iran-hack-water-biden-anne-neuberger-cybersecurity-51886faab07edb61a4459fde0dabbbac\">utilities</a> and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hack-ransomware-extortion-moveit-cisa-0a642dd9b3544552d8802befec6de9af\">government agencies</a> all have been exposed.</p><p>Lurie has directed patients to use a call center and said it can help people refill prescriptions, discuss appointments and reach health care providers.</p><p>\u201cWe recognize the frustration and concern the situation creates for all of those impacted,\u201d Malakooti said Thursday. \u201cWe are so grateful for this community for the outpouring of support, and we are especially inspired by our workforce and their resilience in their commitment to our mission.\u201d</p><p>But some parents have reported the center isn't keeping up with their needs, leaving families uncertain when they can get answers.</p><p>Brett Callow, a threat analyst with cybersecurity firm Emsisoft, said it can take weeks for a hospital to restore normal operations after a cyberattack, prioritizing critical systems first.</p><p>The latest annual report for Lurie Children\u2019s said staff treated around 260,000 patients last year. Chicago-area pediatrician practices that work with the hospital also have reported being unable to access digital medical records because of the attack.</p>",
