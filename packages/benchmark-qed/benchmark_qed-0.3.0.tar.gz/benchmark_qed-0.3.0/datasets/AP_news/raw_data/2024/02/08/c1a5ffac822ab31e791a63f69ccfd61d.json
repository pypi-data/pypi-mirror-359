Fauci served under seven presidents, starting with Ronald Reagan, but he is best known for his time during Donald Trump's administration, when he and the White House often clashed over how to respond to the coronavirus.</p><p>Millions regarded Fauci, with his raspy voice and plainspoken style, as the government's trusted point man during the heights of the pandemic. But he would become increasingly estranged from Trump, who favored a faster return to normal life and advocated unproven treatments. Republicans and anti-vaxxers have since criticized him relentlessly on a wide range of issues and have written books attacking him, including Sen. Rand Paul's \u201cDeception: The Great Covid Cover-Up\u201d and Robert F. Kennedy Jr's \u201cThe Real Anthony Fauci.\u201d</p><p>Fauci had been involved in controversy before. In the 1980s, the activist group ACT UP condemned Fauci for what it called his indifferent response to the spread of AIDS. But he would win over many of his critics, meeting with ACT UP members and agreeing to such requests as letting people with HIV serve on research committees and accelerating the process of finding treatments.</p><p>During President George W. Bush's administration, Fauci helped develop <a href=\"https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/pepfar-global-aids/pepfar/\">PEPFAR,</a> the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. In 2008, Bush awarded Fauci the Presidential Medal of Freedom for \u201chis efforts to advance the understanding and treatment of HIV/AIDS.\u201d</p><p>Financial terms for Fauci's memoir were not disclosed. He was represented by Washington attorney Robert Barnett, whose clients have included Bush, and former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.</p>",
