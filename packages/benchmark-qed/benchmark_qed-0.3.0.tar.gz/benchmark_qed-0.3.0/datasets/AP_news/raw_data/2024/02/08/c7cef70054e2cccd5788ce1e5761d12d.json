    "description_summary": "A federal civil-rights lawsuit says a Washington State Patrol trooper arrested a woman on suspicion of drunken driving when she was actually experiencing a life-threatening brain bleed. The Seattle Times reports the lawsuit filed in Tacoma Feb. 1 says Nicole McClure was booked into Thurston County Jail in 2022 and lay on a cell floor for a day before receiving medical attention. The lawsuit says doctors later removed part of her skull. Her lawyer says McClure now has permanent disabilities which would have been lessened had she received immediate medical attention. A state patrol spokesperson and a jail spokesperson each said the agencies don't comment on pending litigation.",

(AP) \u2014 A Washington State Patrol trooper arrested a woman on suspicion of drunken driving when she was actually experiencing a life-threatening brain bleed and booked her into jail where officials mocked her instead of getting her medical attention, according to a civil rights lawsuit.</p><p>The federal lawsuit filed Feb. 1 in Tacoma says Nicole McClure was booked into Thurston County Jail on March 21, 2022, where she lay on a cell floor for a day before receiving medical attention, <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/wa-trooper-mistook-womans-brain-bleed-for-drunken-driving-lawsuit-alleges/\">The Seattle Times reported.</a></p><p>Doctors later removed part of her skull to relieve pressure building inside her brain from a frontal-lobe subdural hematoma, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>\u201cNicole suffers from severe traumatic brain injury and remains unable to care for herself or engage with life in meaningful ways,\u201d McClure\u2019s attorney, Anne Vankirk, said in a statement. \u201cHad Nicole received immediate medical attention, her condition would have been significantly easier to treat and the outcome far less severe.\u201d</p><p>According to the lawsuit, dash-camera video and arrest reports, Trooper Jonathan Barnes tried to stop McClure after he noticed her driving too slowly and wandering out of her lane. McClure, then 38, had complained of a headache and dizziness and was headed home from work early, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>Barnes flashed his emergency lights to initiate a stop, but McClure kept slowly driving until she collided with a traffic roundabout, disabling her car, the lawsuit said.</p><p>Barnes approached with his gun pointed at McClure, yelling for her to get out of the car, dash-camera video shows. The video shows Barnes pushed her onto his vehicle hood to handcuff her while accusing her of eluding police.</p><p>The video also recorded Barnes repeatedly asking McClure if she was on drugs or had been drinking. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you used meth?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhen was the last time you used heroin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t \u2026 I don\u2019t,\u201d she said, according to the video. \u201cI\u2019m confused. I think I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>Barnes arrested McClure on suspicion of intoxicated driving and felony evading. The lawsuit alleges the trooper also didn\u2019t call medics to the scene, despite the vehicle crash, and took her to a hospital for a blood draw, the filings allege.</p><p>Barnes didn\u2019t tell hospital staff that McClure had been in a crash, the lawsuit says. The filings also claim that in his written report, the trooper crossed out a section detailing a series of health and medical questions, printing \u201cDid not ask\u201d across the strikeout.</p><p>After the blood draw \u2014 which the lawsuit says later showed McClure had no drugs or alcohol in her system \u2014 Barnes took her to the Thurston County Jail.</p><p>Chris Loftis, a state patrol spokesperson, said the agency is aware of the lawsuit but doesn\u2019t comment on pending litigation. He said Barnes wasn\u2019t disciplined. A call from The Associated Press to the state patrol union seeking comment from Barnes was redirected to Loftis.</p><p>The lawsuit alleges that McClure received no medical attention at the jail for over 24 hours despite her asking for help, vomiting, and her inability to stand up.</p><p>\u201cNicole recalls being laughed at and told she should \u2018Have another shot,\u2019\u201d which she took as a taunting reference to the belief that she was drunk, not sick, Vankirk said.</p><p>Hours later McClure was taken to a hospital, where she underwent emergency brain surgery and was hospitalized for 17 days, according to Vankirk.</p><p>Tara Tsehlana, a spokesperson for the Thurston County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office, which defends the jail, said the county has been served with the lawsuit.</p><p>\u201cWhile we can\u2019t discuss the specifics of any pending litigation, I can confirm that the safety of inmates, staff, and the general public remains a top priority for the Thurston County Corrections Facility,\u201d she said.</p><p>___</p><p>This story has been corrected to show the lawsuit was filed Feb. 1, not Feb. 8.</p>",
