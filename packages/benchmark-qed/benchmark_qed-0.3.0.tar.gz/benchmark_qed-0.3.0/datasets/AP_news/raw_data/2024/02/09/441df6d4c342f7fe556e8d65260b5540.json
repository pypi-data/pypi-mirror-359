The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its flu data on Friday. It shows a continued national decline in flu hospitalizations. But it also shows increases in other indicators \u2014 including the number of states with high or very high levels for respiratory illnesses. Flu-like illnesses seem to be proliferating in the Midwest. Last week, those illnesses were at high levels in 23 states \u2014 up from 18 the week before.",

Last week, reports were at high levels in 23 states \u2014 up from 18 the week before, CDC officials said.</p><p>Flu generally peaks in the U.S. between December and February. National data suggests this season's peak came around late December, but a second surge is always possible. That's happened in other flu seasons, with the second peak often \u2014 but not always \u2014 lower than the first, Budd said.</p><p>So far, the season has been relatively typical, Budd said. According to CDC estimates, since the beginning of October, there have been at least 22 million illnesses, 250,000 hospitalizations, and 15,000 deaths from flu. The agency said 74 children have died of flu.</p><p>COVID-19 illnesses seem to have peaked at around he same time as flu. CDC <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklyhospitaladmissions_select_00\">data</a> indicates coronavirus-caused hospitalizations haven\u2019t hit the same levels they did at the same point during the last three winters. COVID-19 is putting more people in the hospital than flu, CDC <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/resp-net/dashboard.html\">data</a> shows.</p><p>The national trends have played out in Chapel Hill, said Dr. David Weber, an infectious diseases expert at the University of North Carolina.</p><p>Weber is also medical director of infection prevention at UNC Medical Center, where about a month ago more than 1O0 of the hospital's 1,000 beds were filled with people with COVID-19, flu or the respiratory virus RSV.</p><p>That's not as bad as some previous winters \u2014 at one point during the pandemic, 250 beds were filled with COVID-19 patients. But it was bad enough that the hospital had to declare a capacity emergency so that it could temporarily bring some additional beds into use, Weber said.</p><p>Now, about 35 beds are filled with patients suffering from one of those viruses, most of them COVID-19, he added.</p><p>\u201cI think in general it's been a pretty typical year,\u201d he said, adding that what's normal has changed to include COVID-19, making everything a little busier than it was before the pandemic.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
