The British Medical Association, the union that represents the so-called junior doctors, said on Friday that the government had \u201cfailed to meet the deadline to put an improved pay offer on the table\u201d and that they would go on strike from Feb. 24 to Feb. 28. The Conservative government has said it won\u2019t negotiate unless the union calls off the strike. The main Labour Party opposition says Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is to blame.",

The BMA has been asking for 35% \u201cpay restoration\u201d as its starting position, but has said it is willing to negotiate.</p><p>The Conservative government has said it won't negotiate unless the union calls off the strike.</p><p>\u201cWe already provided them with a pay increase of up to 10.3% and were prepared to go further,\" said Health Secretary Victoria Atkins. \u201cI ask the junior doctors\u2019 committee to cancel their action and come back to the table to find a way forward for patients and our NHS.\"</p><p>Senior doctors, known as consultants, and other medics have been drafted in to cover for emergency services, critical care and maternity services during the strikes. The consultants themselves are also in dispute with the government over their recent pay award but have yet to set any dates for any further strikes.</p><p>The upcoming strike means thousands more canceled appointments and operations, putting further pressure on the NHS to deal with a backlog that is likely to be a key issue in the general election later this year.</p><p>Britain has endured a year of rolling strikes across the health sector as staff sought pay rises to offset the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/thousands-march-in-london-to-protest-surging-costs\">soaring cost of living</a>. Unions say wages, especially in the public sector, have fallen in real terms over the past decade, and double-digit inflation in late 2022 and early 2023, fueled by sharply rising food and energy prices, left many workers struggling to pay their bills.</p><p>Many groups within the NHS, such as nurses and ambulance crews, have reached pay deals with the government, but the union representing junior doctors has held out, and negotiations broke down late last year.</p><p>If it goes ahead, the strike would be the junior doctors' last on the current mandate, which expires at the end of the month. Further strikes would require another vote among members which the BMA is currently undertaking.</p><p>The government is seeking to apportion many of the problems in the NHS on the junior doctors, while the main opposition Labour Party, which is way ahead in opinion polls, points the finger at <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/rishi-sunak\">Prime Minister Rishi Sunak</a> for personally blocking progress.</p><p>\u201cHe bears responsibility for the canceled operations and appointments desperate patients will face once again,\u201d said Wes Streeting, Labour's health spokesman. \u201cThis can\u2019t go on. Patients are desperate and staff are worn out.\u201d</p>",
