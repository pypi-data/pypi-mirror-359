    "description_summary": "Any parent who's ever called one of their children by the other's name likely could empathize when President Joe Biden mixed up the names of French leaders Macron and Mitterrand. Donald Trump is making similar gaffes, such as confusing Republican challenger Nikki Haley and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Experts say everyone makes these kinds of flubs. Only medical tests can tell whether a verbal stumble is a sign of trouble. The 81-year-old Biden has long history of verbal gaffes. But they\u2019re getting new attention after a special counsel decided Biden shouldn\u2019t face criminal charges for his handling of classified documents, while describing him as an old man with trouble remembering dates.",

But when are those and other verbal stumbles normal, and when might they be a sign of cognitive trouble?</p><p>\u201cWhen I see somebody make a flub on TV, I\u2019m really not all that concerned,\u201d said well-known aging researcher S. Jay Olshansky of the University of Illinois at Chicago. \u201cWhat science will tell you about flubs is that they\u2019re perfectly normal, and they are exacerbated by stress for sure.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-age-poll-trump-2024-620e0a5cfa0039a6448f607c17c7f23e\">Biden</a>, 81, has a decadeslong history of verbal gaffes. But they\u2019re <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-special-counsel-classified-documents-election-2024-a54f03441e8145f9d6915858caaac37e\">getting new attention</a> after a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-hur-garland-classified-documents-836b99fe9cbef9ba7d32602f4928efec\">special counsel</a> this past week decided <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/storage/report-from-special-counsel-robert-k-hur-february-2024.pdf\">Biden shouldn\u2019t face criminal charges for his handling of classified documents</a> \u2014 while describing him as an <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-memory-age-special-counsel-report-doj-f4232bc8316e556ed467185b67c3e0a8\">old man with trouble remembering dates</a>, even the date his <a href=\"https://apnews.com/general-news-d8f69eb645d74b7886387f713981b739\">son Beau died</a>.</p><p>That prompted a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/02/08/remarks-by-president-biden/\">visibly angry Biden to lash out from the White House</a>, saying, \u201cMy memory is fine.\u201d As for his son\u2019s 2015 death from brain cancer, \u201cFrankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself, it wasn\u2019t any of their damn business,\u201d Biden said.</p><p>Biden is not the only candidate making verbal slips. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump\">Former President Donald Trump</a>, Biden's likely opponent in the November presidential election, has also. Last month the 77-year-old Trump <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nikki-haley-trump-mental-fitness-pelosi-522c3cddcaf7b85df5a64658c5041e96\">confused his major opponent</a> for the GOP nomination, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.</p><p>Health experts caution that neither verbal gaffes nor a lawyer's opinions can reveal whether someone is having cognitive trouble. That takes medical testing.</p><p>But certain glitches are common at any age.</p><p>\u201cTo easily recall names, right in the moment, is the hardest thing for us to do accurately,\u201d said Dr. Eric Lenze of Washington University in St. Louis, a geriatric psychiatrist who evaluates cognition in older adults.</p><p>Some studies have suggested that everyday \u201cmisnaming\u201d may occur when the brain has names stored by category \u2014 like your family members or perhaps in Biden\u2019s case, world leaders he\u2019s long known \u2014 and grabs the wrong one. Or the miss may be phonetic, as the names of France\u2019s current president, Emmanuel Macron, and former President Francois Mitterrand both begin with \u201cM.\u201d Mitterrand died in 1996.</p><p>As for dates, emotion may tag certain memories but not run-of-the-mill ones, such as the special counsel's questions about when Biden handled a box of documents.</p><p>\u201cAttaching a calendar date to an event is not really something that the human brain does at any age,\u201d Lenze said. It\u2019s \u201cnot like a spreadsheet.\u201d</p><p>Whether it's a name, date or something else, memory also can be affected by stress and distractions \u2014 if someone's thinking about more than one thing, Olshansky said. And while everybody's had an \u201cit's on the tip of my tongue\u201d lapse, flubs by presidents, or would-be presidents, tend to be caught on TV.</p><p>Olshansky watches recordings of his presentations at science meetings and \u201cthere isn\u2019t a single time I don\u2019t make a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m 69 years old, which I do not consider to be old, but I made the same mistakes when I was 39.\u201d</p><p>It's reasonable for people to wonder if leaders in their 70s and 80s remain sharp, Lenze said. What's reassuring is if overall, what someone says is overall accurate despite a verbal gaffe.</p><p>Some cognitive aging is normal, including delay in memory retrieval. People\u2019s brains age differently, and heart health, blood pressure and physical activity play a role in brain health.</p><p>And while Trump often brags about <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-election-2020-ap-top-news-dementia-elections-c8e5d800f5eb545c7aee8c5b597e6df4\">passing a screening-style memory test</a> several years ago, Lenze said the best assessment includes rigorous neuropsychological testing.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

It includes insights from health experts about memory, cognitive aging, and the normalcy of such errors, which are relevant to the topic of health. However, the primary focus is on the political implications and public perception of these gaffes rather than a deep dive into health-related issues.
