In a statement issued late Saturday, the monarch said that such thoughts are \u201cthe greatest comfort and encouragement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is equally heartening to hear how sharing my own diagnosis has helped promote public understanding and shine a light on the work of all those organizations which support cancer patients and their families across the U.K. and wider world,\u201d he said in a statement, signed Charles R.</p><p>\u201cMy lifelong admiration for their tireless care and dedication is all the greater as a result of my own personal experience.\u201d</p><p>Buckingham Palace announced the king\u2019s diagnosis on Monday, less than three weeks after he was treated for an enlarged prostate. While palace officials didn\u2019t disclose the type of cancer, they said it wasn\u2019t prostate cancer.</p><p>On Sunday, a crowd of about 100 gathered outside the gates of the estate to show their support for the king. Charles and Camilla greeted a priest as they walked into the Anglican church, and waved to the crowd as they left.</p><p>St. Mary Magdalene is a medieval stone church that was restored in the 19th century. Protected as a historic building, the church includes memorials to the royal family stretching from Princess Alice in 1879 to King George VI, Charles\u2019 grandfather, in 1952.</p><p>Nearby Sandringham House, the private home of the past six British monarchs, sits amid parkland, gardens and working farms. It has been owned by the royal family since 1862.</p><p>Charles has visited the estate regularly since he was a child, when he would run through the halls playing tag and hide-and-seek with his mother, according to biographer Jonathan Dimbleby. In later years he has retreated to the estate on the north coast of Norfolk to enjoy hunting and nature walks through the windswept countryside.</p>",
