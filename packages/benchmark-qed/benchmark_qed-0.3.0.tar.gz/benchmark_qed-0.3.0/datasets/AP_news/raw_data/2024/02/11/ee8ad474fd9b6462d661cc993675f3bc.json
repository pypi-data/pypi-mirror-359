Agents say the passenger returning from a visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo reported that the luggage contained dried fish, but an inspection at Boston Logan Airport revealed four mummified monkeys. The CBP says raw or minimally processed meat from wild animals, sometimes referred to as \u201cbushmeat,\u201d is banned because of the threat of disease. The incident happened last month. A CBP spokesperson said Sunday that the luggage was seized and the nearly 9 pounds of bushmeat was marked for destruction.",
