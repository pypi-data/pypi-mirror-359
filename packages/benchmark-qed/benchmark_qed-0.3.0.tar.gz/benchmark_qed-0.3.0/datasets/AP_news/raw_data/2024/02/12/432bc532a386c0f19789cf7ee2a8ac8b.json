    "description_summary": "West Virginia lawmakers are pushing to make the state the 12th in the nation to ban smoking in cars with children. The state Senate on Monday passed a bill making it a misdemeanor to smoke in a vehicle with a child under 17. The bill goes to the House of Delegates. But people can't be pulled over just for smoking with a child present. West Virginia has the highest use of cigarette smoking among adults in the nation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 11 states have the ban. The West Virginia bill\u2019s main sponsor is a doctor and says a nonsmoking patient who lost half her lung function had to hide from her father\u2019s smoke.",

(AP) \u2014 Smoking in cars with children is banned in 11 states, and lawmakers are pushing to join them in West Virginia, where more adults use cigarettes than anywhere else in the nation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>The state Senate on Monday passed a bill calling for fines for anyone caught smoking or possessing a lit tobacco product in a vehicle when someone age 16 or under is present. The bill passed on 25-8 vote and now goes to the House of Delegates, where similar legislation has failed and it faces an uncertain future.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Tom Takubo, a doctor-turned-lawmaker, made a promise long ago to a patient whose father was a heavy smoker that he would try to ban smoking in vehicles carrying children in West Virginia. Takubo has made it almost an annual effort since 2017 to introduce the legislation, but it didn't gain traction.</p><p>The Kanawha County Republican and lung doctor said the inspiration for the bill was a patient who was not a smoker but lost half of her lung function. When her father smoked, \u201cshe had to climb down to the bottom of the car and put her head underneath the seat,\u201d Takubo said.</p><p>Violators would face a misdemeanor subject to a maximum fine of $25. But it would be a secondary offense: smoking with children present cannot be the main reason a driver is pulled over.</p><p>Sen. Mike Azinger, a Wood County Republican, said the state has no right to infringe on parents' freedoms.</p><p>\u201cThe arguments for the bill are essentially emotional arguments,\" Azinger said. \"This is a cut at the fundamental rights of parents making a decision over their children in their vehicle. This is a state going where it has no business going.\u201d</p>",
