    "description_summary": "Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman has sued one of the nation\u2019s largest grocery chains. He claims that the Kroger Co.'s pharmacies helped fuel the state\u2019s deadly opioid addiction crisis. The lawsuit against Kroger says its more than 100 Kentucky pharmacies were responsible for over 11% of all opioid pills dispensed in the state between 2006 and 2019. The suit says that amounted to hundreds of millions of doses inundating Kentucky communities without reasonable safeguards. The lawsuit was filed Monday in Bullitt County Circuit Court. Kroger officials did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",

(AP) \u2014 Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman filed a lawsuit Monday against one of the nation\u2019s largest grocery chains, claiming its pharmacies helped fuel the state's deadly opioid addiction crisis.</p><p>The lawsuit against the Kroger Co. says its more than 100 Kentucky pharmacies were responsible for over 11% of all opioid pills dispensed in the state between 2006 and 2019. It amounted to hundreds of millions of doses inundating Kentucky communities without reasonable safeguards, the suit said.</p><p>\u201cFor more than a decade, Kroger flooded Kentucky with an almost unthinkable number of opioid pills that directly led to addiction, pain and death,\u201d Coleman said in a statement.</p><p>The lawsuit was filed in Bullitt County Circuit Court in Shepherdsville, 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Louisville. Among other things, the suit is seeking civil penalties of $2,000 against the grocery chain for each alleged willful violation of the Kentucky Consumer Protection Act.</p><p>Kroger officials did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment Monday.</p><p>The Bluegrass State has been hard hit by the nation's overdose crisis, and a series of Kentucky attorneys general from both political parties \u2014 including now-Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat \u2014 aggressively pursued legal action against companies that make or distribute opioid-based medication. Coleman, a Republican who took office at the start of this year, continued the trend with his suit against Kroger \u2014 a prominent corporate brand in Kentucky.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kentucky-drug-overdose-deaths-07ef0b34ce8b6fb015c3e2653555e7fd\">Overdose fatalities in Kentucky</a> surpassed 2,000 again in 2022 but were down from the prior year, Beshear said in a 2023 announcement. Increased use of fentanyl \u2014 a powerful synthetic opioid \u2014 is blamed as a key factor behind the state\u2019s chronically high overdose death toll.</p><p>The new lawsuit claims that Kroger failed to implement any effective monitoring program to stop suspicious opioid orders. As a distributor and dispenser, Kroger had access to real-time data revealing unusual prescribing patterns, Coleman's office said. Despite such \u201cred flags,\u201d Kroger did not report a single suspicious prescription in Kentucky between 2007 and 2014, the AG's office said.</p><p>\u201cKroger, which families have trusted for so long, knowingly made these dangerous and highly addictive substances all too accessible,\" Coleman said. \u201cWorst of all, Kroger never created a formal system, a training or even a set of guidelines to report suspicious activity or abuse.\u201d</p><p>The suit alleges Kroger bought more than four billion morphine milligram equivalents of opioids for Kentucky between 2006 and 2019, roughly equivalent to 444 million opioid doses. The company distributed almost 194 million hydrocodone pills to its Kentucky pharmacies between 2006 and 2019, the suit said.</p>",
