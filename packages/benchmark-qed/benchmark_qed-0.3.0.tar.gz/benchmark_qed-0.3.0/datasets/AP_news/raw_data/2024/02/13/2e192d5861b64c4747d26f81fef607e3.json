The Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that 150 more communities will be able to apply for assistance, in addition to 11 chosen in 2022 for a pilot program. More than 2 million people in the U.S. lack indoor plumbing and more live with failing sewage systems that can result in waste backing up into homes or pooling on the ground, threatening public health and degrading basic dignity.",

And then they\u2019re going to get a community solutions plan, which will really articulate ... what are the the improve that can be made, in the most cost effective way possible,\u201d Fox said.</p><p>Still, \u201cthe water infrastructure gap is is greater than the resources we have,\u201d and the Biden administration will continue to advocate for more funding, she said.</p><p>Among the first communities to receive assistance was the San Carlos Apache Reservation in Arizona, where two-thirds of homes have septic systems that often fail. The tribe has received funding to pump septic tanks and develop educational materials, and is applying for funding for infrastructure improvements, Fox said.</p><p>The town of White Hall, in Lowndes County, Alabama, has developed wastewater treatment and funding options to address sewage that sometimes ran into yards.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re so thankful for where we are at this particular point,\u201d said Catherine Flowers, founder of the Center for Rural Enterprise and Environmental Justice.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.
