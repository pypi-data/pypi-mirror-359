The state Board of Regents gave unanimous approval Tuesday to what would be Georgia's second public medical school, located on UGA's campus in Athens. The other is the Medical College of Georgia, based in Augusta. Gov. Brian Kemp and other state officials have said a new medical school is needed as Georgia faces a shortage of doctors. The state House has approved $50 million for the UGA School of Medicine in an amended fiscal 2024 budget that is awaiting a Senate vote. That is roughly half the money needed to build the school. Officials also must obtain accreditation for the new medical school.",
