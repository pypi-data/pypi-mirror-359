    "description_summary": "Abortion rights advocates are trying to get initiatives to protect reproductive health on the ballot in several states this year. And one major difference has emerged in their proposed language: whether to include mental health as an exception. A Missouri proposal would allow lawmakers to restrict abortions after a fetus is considered viable, except if an abortion \u201cis needed to protect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d A similar measure has been proposed in Arizona, but proposals in Florida, Montana and Nebraska do not explicitly mention mental health. The CDC says mental health conditions were the leading underlying cause of pregnancy-related deaths from 2017 to 2019.",

Among them is the inclusion of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-science-health-government-and-politics-arizona-fc2114ecfce72eeca65e21fb970ca62f\">mental health exceptions.</a></p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-missouri-constitutional-amendment-viability-37e28b7609607ae762626206ea1a72c1\">A Missouri proposal</a> would allow lawmakers to restrict abortions after <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-viability-ballot-initiatives-2024-roe-fcf440373973b01f740912cd3bbd98a4\">a fetus is considered viable</a>, except if an abortion \u201cis needed to protect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d A similar measure has been proposed in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-arizona-ballot-voters-2024-a7ea711840cbe2103a9c75c4c4dd4ef3\">Arizona</a>. In 2022, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-abortion-8779f3ee57d4d20d54861a5ed6ba72ff\">Michigan</a> voters passed an abortion rights amendment with a mental health exception for viability limits.</p><p>Meanwhile, proposed ballot measure language in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ballot-measure-arkansas-11a56905a5b57301ad7f0d3c905cd97e\">Arkansas</a> only says \u201cphysical health,\u201d excluding a mental health exception. Proposed abortion rights initiatives in other states, including <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/florida-abortion-ballot-elections-931be34f9ffdd6d74f6beade05eeee47\">Florida</a>, Montana and Nebraska, don\u2019t explicitly mention mental health.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to hear about these policies ignoring mental health,\u201d said Harris, now 21. \u201cAn abortion can save someone\u2019s life, including when they\u2019re in a mental health emergency.\u201d</p><p>Most states with abortion bans include exemptions for life-threatening emergencies, but only Alabama\u2019s includes an exception for \u201cserious mental illness\u201d that could result in the death of the mother or fetus. Lawmakers added the provision after getting pressure from the state\u2019s medical association, which was concerned about women at high risk for suicide.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-alabama-f793146799ba4d399bdc5ca0cb4fa2cb\">The law</a>, passed in 2019, was among the strictest abortion restrictions in the country at the time. It did not include exceptions in cases of rape or incest and considered performing an abortion to be a felony. Alabama began enforcing the ban in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0\">overturned Roe v. Wade</a>, which once granted a federal right to abortion.</p><p>Abortion bans in at least 10 states \u2014 Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Ohio, Tennessee, West Virginia and Wyoming \u2014 explicitly exclude mental health conditions as a possible exception. Others are murkier, allowing for exemptions for the \u201clife and health\u201d of the woman without defining if mental health is included.</p><p>Medical experts say even states that do allow mental health exceptions require patients to jump through hoops that may be inaccessible to some people, especially those with low incomes. Alabama, for example, requires a state-licensed psychiatrist with at least three years of clinical experience to certify the mental health condition as an emergency.</p><p>Some days, when Harris would get home from class, she would be \"so overwhelmed that I\u2019d have a breakdown on the floor,\u201d she said. For two months, she cried every day. But facing an abortion ban in her home state and stigma from doctors, Harris said she didn\u2019t feel comfortable speaking about her experience with a mental health professional.</p><p>\u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t have to jump through hoops and prove their pain to have access to the care they need,\u201d she said.</p><p>Mental health conditions were the leading underlying cause of pregnancy-related deaths from 2017 to 2019 with nearly 23% of pregnancy-related deaths attributed to mental health conditions, including suicides and overdoses from substance use disorders, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/erase-mm/data-mmrc.html\">according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p><p>About one in eight women experience postpartum depression, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/depression/index.htm#Postpartum\">according to the CDC</a>. But mental health struggles during pregnancy, especially the psychological trauma of those forced to carry unwanted pregnancies, are understudied, said Michelle Oberman, a Santa Clara University law professor researching the impact of abortion restrictions.</p><p>\u201cThese statistics, these stories of women\u2019s suffering have been really haunting me,\u201d Oberman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t as a society have a great track record of treating mental health the same way we do physical health.\u201d</p><p>Policies that dismiss mental health as less important than physical health put lives at risk, said Columbia University psychiatrist Paul Appelbaum. He said there is also <a href=\"https://www.ansirh.org/research/ongoing/turnaway-study\">growing evidence</a> that being denied an abortion causes significant mental distress. This distress has been apparent in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-texas-exceptions-lawsuit-82611bda29112775247d8e7adbc0a81b\">recent stories</a> of women forced to flee their states or continue pregnancies despite serious risks to their health.</p><p>\u201cI am extremely concerned by the exclusion of mental health exceptions in these ballot measures,\u201d said Appelbaum, former president of the American Psychiatric Association. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely cruel and will lead to the suffering deaths of pregnant women in these states.\u201d</p><p>Jayme Trevino, an OB-GYN in Missouri and fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, said she has seen first-hand how being denied abortion care can affect a patient\u2019s well-being, including their mental health.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a devastating, regular reality for my patients,\u201d she said, adding that she was grateful for the mental health exemption in the state\u2019s proposed ballot measure language.</p><p>Mallory Schwarz, a spokesperson for Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, said the initiative\u2019s language \u201cis written to make sure that doctors \u2014 not politicians \u2014 are able to determine what\u2019s best for their patients.\u201d</p><p>Conversely, an Arkansas initiative only includes exemptions \u201cto protect a pregnant female\u2019s life or to protect a pregnant female from a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury.\"</p><p>Previous versions of the proposal included broader exceptions, said Gennie Diaz, executive director of For AR People. Initially, she said, \u201cWe wanted to craft language for a constitutional amendment that would be as broad as possible and would hopefully account for something like mental health.\u201d</p><p>But when handed a proposal with exceptions to \u201cprotect the life and health\u201d of the mother, the state\u2019s attorney general, a Republican, rejected the language, saying it must define \u201chealth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a signal to us that we were going to have to make a choice,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cAnd another unfortunate factor is that the majority of Arkansas voters are unlikely to support mental health as a reason for an abortion after a particular timeframe. We felt it was unlikely for a version that explicitly names mental health to pass.\u201d</p><p>Arkansas advocates were also worried the opposition campaign would target a mental health exception, Diaz said.</p><p>The National Right to Life Committee\u2019s model state legislation for abortion bans explicitly excludes mental health exceptions. These exceptions allow pregnant women \u201cto kind of bypass those laws and still abort pregnancies of children that were viable,\u201d said Ingrid Duran, state legislative director of the NRLC.</p><p>\u201cWe specifically exclude mental health exemptions because we saw how that creates a loophole in a law and it leaves that unborn child at risk of dying for a sometimes treatable, sometimes temporary condition that the mother may be experiencing,\u201d she said.</p><p>When asked if targeting mental health exceptions will be part of their strategy for campaigning against abortion ballot measures in 2024, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t necessarily say that would be part of the strategy.\u201d Still, said Duran, \u201cWhen I see mental health exceptions like this, my heart drops.\u201d</p><p>Oberman from Santa Clara University said she expects to see the anti-abortion movement \u201cemploy a strategy of minimizing and dismissing the mental health consequences of forced pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mental health issues of pregnant people remain in the shadows and highly stigmatized,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that clouds our judgment of what a medical emergency looks like during pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.
