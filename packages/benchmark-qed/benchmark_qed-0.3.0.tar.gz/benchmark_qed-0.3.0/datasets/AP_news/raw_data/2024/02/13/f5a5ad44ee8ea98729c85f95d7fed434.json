While the primary focus is on the attack and the hiker's response, the document does provide information about rabies, a significant health concern. It mentions the rarity of rabid coyotes in Rhode Island and references a similar incident in New Hampshire. However, the main emphasis is on the attack and the hiker's actions rather than on broader health implications or detailed information about rabies. Therefore, the document is somewhat relevant to the topic of health but not highly focused on it."
