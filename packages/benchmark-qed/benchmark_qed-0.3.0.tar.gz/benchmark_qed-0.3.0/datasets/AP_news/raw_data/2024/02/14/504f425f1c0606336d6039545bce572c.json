The city spends more than $100 million on youth mental health programs and services each year, Mayor Eric Adams' office said.</p><p>\u201cOver the past decade, we have seen just how addictive and overwhelming the online world can be, exposing our children to a non-stop stream of harmful content and fueling our national youth mental health crisis,\u201d Adams said.</p><p>The legal action is the latest of numerous lawsuits filed by <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/metachildrenteensharmslawsuit-17858802d76143d358e38ee15150dc94\">states,</a><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-technology-seattle-social-media-lawsuits-24adabfb13223a6acb0210b93caf0928\">school districts</a> and others claiming social media companies exploit children and adolescents by deliberating designing features that keep them endlessly scrolling and checking their accounts.</p><p>Teenagers know they spend too much time on social media but are powerless to stop, according to the new lawsuit, filed by the city of New York, its Department of Education and New York City Health and Hospitals Corp., the country\u2019s largest public hospital system.</p><p>The lawsuit seeks to have the companies' conduct declared a public nuisance to be abated, as well as unspecified monetary damages.</p><p>In responses to the filing, the tech companies said they have and continue to develop and implement policies and controls that emphasize user safety.</p><p>\"The allegations in this complaint are simply not true,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda, a spokesman for YouTube parent Google, who said by email that the company has collaborated with youth, mental health and parenting experts.</p><p>A TikTok spokesperson cited similar regular collaborations to understand best practices in the face of industry-wide challenges.</p><p>\u201cTikTok has industry-leading safeguards to support teens\u2019 well-being, including age-restricted features, parental controls, an automatic 60-minute time limit for users under 18, and more,\u201d an emailed statement said.</p><p>Virtually all U.S. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/teens-social-media-tiktok-snapchat-17e0ff4dec0f2744674cac4e7ae5b3ca\">teenagers use social media</a>, and roughly one in six teens describe their use of YouTube and TikTok as \u201calmost constant,\u201d according to the Pew Research Center.</p><p>A spokesperson for Meta, which owns and operates Facebook and Instagram, said the company wants \"teens to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online, and we have over 30 tools and features to support them and their parents. We\u2019ve spent a decade working on these issues and hiring people who have dedicated their careers to keeping young people safe and supported online.\u201d</p><p>A statement from Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, said its app is intentionally different from from others in that it \u201copens directly to a camera \u2013 rather than a feed of content that encourages passive scrolling \u2013 and has no traditional public likes or comments.\u201d</p><p>\"While we will always have more work to do, we feel good about the role Snapchat plays in helping close friends feel connected, happy and prepared as they face the many challenges of adolescence,\u201d the statement said.</p>",
