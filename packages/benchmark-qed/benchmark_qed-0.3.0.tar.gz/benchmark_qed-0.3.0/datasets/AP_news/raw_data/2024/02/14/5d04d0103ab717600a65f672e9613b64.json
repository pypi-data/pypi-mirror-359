The driver was killed and five others, including two children, were injured in Tuesday's crash at St. David\u2019s North Austin Medical Center. Police were still investigating the cause of the crash on Wednesday, but police spokeswoman Ariel Crumes said investigators don't believe it was intentional and that there is is no indication the driver had a medical episode right before the crash.",

While the document does touch on health-related aspects, such as the injuries sustained and the hospital staff's response, the primary focus is on the crash and the aquarium's role in mitigating the damage. The connection to the broader topic of health is somewhat indirect, as the main emphasis is on the accident rather than health issues or medical care."
