Gavin Newsom\u2019s pandemic program to house homeless people in hotel rooms. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said in October that it was limiting the number of days eligible for reimbursement for hotel stays after June 2021. The news stunned officials who say the policy change will cost them at least $300 million. FEMA said in a statement Tuesday that it will consider the state's request for reconsideration. A regional administrator for FEMA has said the policy is not new. Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Project Roomkey in March 2020.",

Gavin Newsom's pandemic program to house homeless people in hotel rooms after the Federal Emergency Management Agency said in October that it was limiting the number of days eligible for reimbursement.</p><p>State and local officials say they were stunned to learn via an October letter that FEMA would only pay to house homeless people at risk of catching COVID-19 for at most 20 days \u2014 as opposed to unlimited \u2014 starting June 11, 2021, which is when Gov. Gavin Newsom <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/government-and-politics-california-coronavirus-pandemic-health-e130f8aea976525bf7184e46dcb5181e\">rescinded</a> the sweeping <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-us-news-ap-top-news-virus-outbreak-gavin-newsom-9ca4a191790dd6f80bd5acec569ec423\">stay-at-home order</a> he issued in March 2020.</p><p>In response, the Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services requested that FEMA reconsider the policy change, saying that it would cost cities and counties at least $300 million at a time when budgets are tight and that local governments had relied on assurances that the federal government would pick up the cost.</p><p>Late Tuesday, FEMA said in a statement that it will review California's Jan. 31 letter, but that all states had been provided \u201cthe same guidance and policy updates throughout the pandemic.\u201d</p><p>Newsom announced the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/general-news-e91f459d9c95c9fedc7db681951f1d8b\">hotel housing program</a> \u2014 called Project Roomkey \u2014 in March 2020 as part of the state's response to the pandemic. Homeless advocates heralded it as a novel way to safeguard residents who could not stay at home to reduce virus transmission. FEMA agreed to pay 75% of the cost, later increasing that to full reimbursement.</p><p>California officials argued to the federal agency that no notice was provided on the policy change.</p><p>Robert J. Fenton, the regional administrator for California who wrote the October letter, told CalMatters, which was <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2024/02/fema-roomkey-october-letter/\">first</a> to report on the discrepancy last week, that the policy was not new.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is clarifying the original guidance of the original policy and providing that back to them,\u201d he told the nonprofit news organization.</p><p>FEMA declined Tuesday to make Fenton available to The Associated Press for an interview.</p><p>Brian Ferguson, a spokesperson for Cal OES, said earlier Tuesday that inaction by FEMA \u201cwould have a chilling effect on the future trust of local governments and the federal government\u201d in times of crisis.</p>",
