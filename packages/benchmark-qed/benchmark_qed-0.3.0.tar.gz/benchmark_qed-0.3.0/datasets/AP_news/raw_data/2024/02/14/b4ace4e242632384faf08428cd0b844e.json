But now that a new year has started, you may realize you picked the wrong plan during Medicare\u2019s fall open enrollment. Maybe your prescription drugs are more expensive than you expected, or one of your specialists is no longer in-network. Medicare Advantage open enrollment runs from Jan. 1 to March 31 each year, and members can switch Medicare Advantage plans or move back to Original Medicare during that time. Here are tips on evaluating your current coverage.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>Many people choose Medicare Advantage plans without exploring their options or noticing what changes their plan may have made, according to research from KFF, a health policy nonprofit. But now that a new year has started, you may realize the plan you picked during Medicare\u2019s fall open enrollment doesn\u2019t work for you. Or maybe you stuck with your old plan and it changed this year. (That can happen, too.)</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/medicare/medicare-advantage-open-enrollment?utm_campaign=ct_prod&utm_source=ap&utm_medium=mpsyn\">Medicare Advantage open enrollment</a>, which runs from Jan. 1 to March 31, gives members the option to switch Medicare Advantage plans or move back to Original Medicare.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s set up especially for people who begin the year enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan and allows them to make certain changes,\u201d says David Lipschutz, associate director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy.</p><p>Here\u2019s where to start.</p><p>DOES YOUR CURRENT COVERAGE WORK FOR YOU?</p><p>Even if you haven\u2019t had a chance to stress test your plan yet, do some research while you still have time to change your mind. Are there providers or specialists you want to see or hospitals you prefer? Make sure they\u2019re in your network.</p><p>Check your medications, particularly if you\u2019re on a newer drug that may be covered differently by different plans. How much do your prescriptions cost under your plan?</p><p>Then, think about your situation this year. \u201cAre there any procedures, like a surgery that\u2019s coming up?\u201d says Christopher Fong, director and co-founder of Smile Insurance Group in Mesa, Arizona. \u201cIs it outpatient? Inpatient? How many emergency room visits do you have? Do you need an electric scooter?\u201d The more you can predict your health care usage, the more accurately you can determine whether you\u2019re in the right plan.</p><p>Next, consider your lifestyle. Do you travel or plan to spend part of the year in another state? Make sure your insurance offers an extended network or travel benefit. Or consider Original Medicare, which allows you to see any doctor in the country who accepts Medicare.</p><p>WHAT CAN YOU DO DURING MEDICARE ADVANTAGE OPEN ENROLLMENT?</p><p>During this time, people who are already enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan can switch \u2014 once \u2014 to another Medicare Advantage plan, or they can return to Original Medicare and purchase a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. But if you don\u2019t already have Medicare Advantage, you can\u2019t join a plan now.</p><p>That said, although you can return to Original Medicare, you may not be able to sign up for Medicare Supplement Insurance, or Medigap. Medigap\u2019s open enrollment period \u2014 when insurance companies must offer you a plan at the same price as everyone else, regardless of health issues \u2014 lasts for six months after you\u2019re 65 and have Medicare Part B. After that, aside from a few states and situations, you\u2019ll be subject to medical underwriting to qualify.</p><p>\u201cWhile you can get in and out of a Medicare Advantage plan on an annual basis, your rights to purchase a Medigap policy are usually far more restrictive,\u201d Lipschutz says.</p><p>SHOULD YOU SWITCH PLANS?</p><p>Some circumstances are red flags \u2014 meaning you should probably change your coverage. If your primary care physician or primary hospital system is now out of network, for instance, you\u2019ll want to look for a plan that includes them.</p><p>If an expensive medication isn\u2019t covered, see if there\u2019s a plan that includes it. (You can input your medications into the <a href=\"https://www.medicare.gov/plan-compare/#/?year=2024&lang=en\">plan finder on Medicare.gov</a> to see options.) Make sure, when you\u2019re estimating drug costs, that you\u2019re as accurate as possible about what you\u2019re taking, including name and dosage. \u201cSome people will get confused between the generic version and the brand name version, and there\u2019s a huge difference,\u201d says Emily Gang, CEO of the Medicare Coach, a site that provides Medicare guidance.</p><p>If you had a health event and found that you weren\u2019t covered in the way that you expected, give switching plans some thought, but consider that any money you\u2019ve paid is a sunk cost. You\u2019ve already spent it, Gang says. And it may not make sense to start over in a new plan with a new deductible.</p><p>In general, resist switching plans for the perks alone. \u201cWe\u2019re not proponents of benefit chasing unless everything else lines up correctly for the member,\u2019\u201d Fong says.</p><p>Then, next year, do your homework during Medicare\u2019s fall open enrollment from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7. \u201cIdeally, you look at the plan details in advance to avoid any surprises,\u201d Gang says.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.
