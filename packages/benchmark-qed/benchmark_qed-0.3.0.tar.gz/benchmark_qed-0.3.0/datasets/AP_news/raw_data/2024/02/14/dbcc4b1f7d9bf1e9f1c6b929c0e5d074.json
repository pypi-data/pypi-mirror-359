Janet Mills has unveiled a $71 million supplemental budget that includes several initiatives proposed after the deadliest mass shooting in state history. The spending plan includes funding to boost mental health initiatives, support required assessments under the state\u2019s so-called yellow flag law and promote an existing firearm storage program. The proposed budget adjustment follows through on the governor\u2019s promise to set aside more than $100 million for the next two-year budget when state revenues are anticipated to level off, potentially straining state finances. The adjustment would bring the two-year budget to $10.41 billion.",
