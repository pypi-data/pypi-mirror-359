    "description_summary": "Cybersecurity experts are warning that hospitals around the United States are at risk for attacks such as the one that's crippling operations at a premier Midwestern children\u2019s hospital. Experts want the government in Washington to do more to prevent such breaches. Assailants often operate from American adversaries such as Russia, North Korea and Iran, where they enjoy big payouts from their victims and face little prospect of ever being punished. Federal health officials acknowledge the increase in cyberattacks on hospitals and say they are working to develop new rules to help health care facilities protect themselves against cyber threats. But they say more money is needed from Congress to help hospitals protect themselves.",

Today, they are a favorite target for internet thieves who hold systems' data and networks hostage for hefty ransoms, said John Riggi, the American Hospital Association\u2019s cybersecurity adviser.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, the unintended consequence of the use of all this network and internet connected technology is it expanded our digital attack surface,\u201d Riggi said. \u201cSo, many more opportunities for bad guys to penetrate our networks.\u201d</p><p>The assailants often operate from American adversaries such as Russia, North Korea and Iran, where they enjoy big payouts from their victims and face little prospect of ever being punished.</p><p>In November, a ransomware attack on a health care chain that operates <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cyberattack-hospital-emergency-outage-4c808c1dad8686458ecbeababd08fecf\">30 hospitals and 200 health facilities in the United States forced doctors to divert</a> patients from emergency rooms and postpone elective surgeries. Meanwhile, a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/12/politics/cyberattack-hospital-closure/index.html\">rural Illinois hospital announced</a> it was permanently closing last year because it couldn\u2019t recover financially from a cyberattack. And <a href=\"https://6abc.com/lehigh-valley-health-network-cyberattack-dark-web-stolen-documents/12926619/\">hackers went as far as posting photos and patient information of breast cancer patients</a> who were receiving treatment at a Pennsylvania health network after the system was hacked last year.</p><p>Now, one of the top children's hospitals in the country, the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago, has been forced to put its phone, email and medical record systems offline as it battles a cyberattack. The FBI has said it is investigating.</p><p>Brett Callow, an analyst for the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft, <a href=\"https://www.emsisoft.com/en/blog/44987/the-state-of-ransomware-in-the-u-s-report-and-statistics-2023/\">counted</a> 46 cyberattacks on hospitals last year, compared with 25 in 2022. The paydays for criminals have gotten bigger too, with the average payout jumping from $5,000 in 2018 to $1.5 million last year.</p><p>\u201cUnless governments do something more meaningful, more significant than they have done to date, it\u2019s inevitable that it\u2019ll get worse,\u201d Callow said.</p><p>Callow believes the government should ban cyberattack victims such as hospitals, local governments and schools from paying ransoms. \u201cThere\u2019s so much money being paid into the ransomware system now there\u2019s no way the problem is going to simply go away on itself,\u201d he said.</p><p>The dramatic increase in these online raids has prompted the nation\u2019s top health agency to <a href=\"https://aspr.hhs.gov/cyber/Documents/Health-Care-Sector-Cybersecurity-Dec2023-508.pdf\">develop new rules for hospitals to protect themselves from cyber threats</a>.</p><p>The Department of Health and Human Services said it will rewrite the rules for the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/hipaa.html\">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</a> -\u2013 the federal law commonly called HIPPA that requires insurers and health systems to protect patient information \u2013 to include new provisions that address cybersecurity later this year.</p><p>The department is also considering new cybersecurity requirements attached to hospitals\u2019 Medicaid and Medicare funding.</p><p>\u201cThe more prepared we are the better,\u201d said Deputy Secretary Andrea Palm.</p><p>But, she added, some hospitals will struggle to protect themselves. She is worried about rural hospitals, for example, that may have difficulty cobbling together money to properly update their cybersecurity. HHS wants more money from Congress to tackle the issue, but Palm said the agency doesn\u2019t have a precise dollar amount its seeking.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that this has to come with resources,\" Palm said. \"We can\u2019t set the industry up not to be able to meet requirements.\u201d</p><p>Becoming the victim of a cyberattack is costly, too.

The hospital, which served more than 260,000 patients last year, has established a separate call center for patients' needs and resumed some care.</p><p>On Thursday, Lurie\u2019s surgeons operated on Jason Castillo\u2019s 7-month-old daughter mostly by hand, without some of the high-tech devices usually used.</p><p>His daughter\u2019s planned heart surgery was postponed on Jan. 31, when the hospital found itself under cyber siege. The surgeon talked to Castillo before his daughter was wheeled in for a six-hour surgery, promising that he felt confident he could do the procedure despite the ongoing cyberattack.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing fantastic,\u201d Castillo said of his daughter, who is now recovering at home. \u201cIt feels like a huge cloud has been lifted from our household.\u201d</p><p>Even once Lurie has restored their network, it'll likely take months of behind-the-scenes work for the hospital to fully rebound, Callow said.</p><p>\u201cThese incidents can affect everything from patient care to payroll,\u201d Callow said. \u201cFully recovering can take months, it\u2019s not simply a matter of flicking a switch and everything comes back on.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Kathleen Foody in Chicago contributed to this report.</p>",
