But Walli Carranza says no one seemed listen or take action. Carranza told The Associated Press on Wednesday she believes systemic failures and lax gun laws led to Sunday\u2019s shooting at celebrity pastor Joel Osteen\u2019s Lakewood Church. Police say Genesse Moreno entered the church with her 7-year-old son and opened fire in a hallway. Two people were injured, including her son, who was shot in the head. Carranza says the boy remains in critical condition but is improving.",

But Walli Carranza said nothing came of her actions.</p><p>Carranza said she believes systemic failures as well as <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/texas-gun-politics-health-coronavirus-pandemic-f6069888ee2de2441d8ab776e9fe45dc\">lax gun laws</a> ultimately led to Sunday\u2019s shooting at celebrity pastor <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/osteen-church-shooting-1b923d90cfb181bd3aa820d529bd3193\">Joel Osteen\u2019s Lakewood Church</a> in which Genesse Moreno entered the church with her 7-year-old son and opened fire in a hallway. Two people were wounded in the shooting, including Moreno's son, who was shot in the head. Moreno was gunned down by security officers she exchanged gunfire with.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t put responsibility on the mind, when the mind was so very ill. A healthy mother would never bring her child to a situation like this. That\u2019s not mental health. So sometimes we don\u2019t have to find a guilty party or place blame. We can just say there are systems that failed,\u201d Carranza told The Associated Press in an interview.</p><p>Carranza said her grandson Samuel remained in critical condition, but that he was doing better.</p><p>Various questions about the shooting remained unanswered on Wednesday, including Moreno\u2019s motive and details about how she obtained the AR-style rifle she used.</p><p>Carranza said her son Enrique Carranza and Moreno met at the University of Houston and married in September 2015. They divorced in 2022.</p><p>Carranza said her son, who is currently incarcerated in Florida, didn't want to divorce Moreno and only \u201cwanted his wife to get healthy.\u201d</p><p>Carranza said Child Protective Services was notified after Moreno was accused by nurses of putting adult medication in her son\u2019s feeding tube after his birth in 2016. Other concerns, including allegations that Moreno left guns unattended in her home, were also forwarded to CPS but no action was taken, Carranza said.</p><p>\u201cMy great concern for Sam was that he was going to shoot himself, and that\u2019s what we warned against,\u201d Carranza said. She added that in January 2020, when Moreno and her grandson visited her in Colorado, Samuel pulled a handgun from his diaper bag and gave it to her.</p><p>Melissa Landford, spokesperson for the state Department of Family and Protective Services, said CPS could not comment on the case for confidentiality reasons.</p><p>Carranza also said that in 2020 and 2021, her attorney sent emails to Lakewood Church asking for assistance with intervening in Moreno's struggles, believing that Moreno's mother attended the church.</p><p>Church spokesman Don Iloff said Wednesday that records show Moreno \u201csporadically\u201d attended services at Lakewood for a couple years but there were no records of her being at the church after 2022.</p><p>Iloff said they were still looking but had not found any records showing Moreno's mother attended the church. He added that church officials also had not found records of the emails sent by Carranza's attorney but they were still looking.</p><p>Iloff said in situations where someone may reach out for help, what the church can offer them is spiritual and biblical counseling.</p><p>\u201cIf we had reached out and (Moreno) had accepted counseling, then we definitely would have been more than happy to provide that,\u201d Iloff said.</p><p>In a video message on Instagram, Osteen invited people to attend a special service at the church this coming Sunday to celebrate a \u201ctime of healing and restoration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not people of fear. We are people of faith. God has us in the palm of his hand, and this is not the time to shrink back. This is the time to turn to God, to rally together,\u201d Osteen said.</p><p>Texas law generally bans someone convicted of a felony from owning a gun for several years after they are released from prison. Misdemeanors connected to domestic violence will also trigger a ban.</p><p>But Moreno\u2019s extensive list of misdemeanors, ranging from forging a $100 bill to shoplifting and assault, did not meet that threshold.</p><p>Texas <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/4934032ba24744ad8eab6352fbb3ae54\">also lacks</a> a so-called <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/guns-mass-shooting-schools-uvalde-biden-83c7ece4a3ffb6ff033a07737303d772\">\u201cred flag\u201d law</a>, which generally allows law enforcement or family members to ask a judge to order the seizure or surrender of guns from someone who is deemed dangerous, often because of mental health concerns or threats of violence.</p><p>Carranza said she met for hours with FBI agents on Tuesday, discussing the reports she filed over the years about Moreno.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Jim Vertuno in Austin contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Juan A.

            "reason": "The document primarily focuses on a shooting incident at a church in Texas, detailing the background of the shooter, her mental health struggles, and systemic failures that may have contributed to the event. While mental health is a significant aspect of the story, the overall focus is more on the incident, the individuals involved, and the legal and systemic issues rather than on health as a broader topic. Therefore, the document is somewhat relevant to the topic of health but not highly focused on it."
