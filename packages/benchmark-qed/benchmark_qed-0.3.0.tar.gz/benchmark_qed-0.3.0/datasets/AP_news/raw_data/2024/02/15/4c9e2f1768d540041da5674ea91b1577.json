State law prohibits abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy except when the mother\u2019s health or life is in danger or there is a fatal fetal anomaly. The Republican-led House voted earlier this month 193-184 in favor of a constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights up to that threshold. But that was short of the majority needed to advance the proposal. On Thursday, the Republican-led Senate rejected a similar measure outright. The Senate voted 14-9 along party lines against a more broadly worded proposal to add language to the constitution protecting \u201cpersonal reproductive autonomy.\u201d",

That would be akin to an outright ban as virtually no one knows they are pregnant at that point.</p><p>Another rejected measure would have required abortions after 15 weeks to be performed with two doctors present and in hospitals with neonatal intensive care units.</p>",

While the primary focus is on the political and legal aspects, abortion rights are inherently connected to health, particularly women's reproductive health. The document also touches on issues like medication-assisted abortions and the involvement of healthcare providers, which are directly related to health. However, the document does not delve deeply into health outcomes or medical details, which slightly reduces its relevance to the health topic."
