The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says reported cases surpassed 62,000 in 2022, after averaging about 37,000 a year in 2017 through 2019. An estimated 476,000 Americans are diagnosed with it each year, but only a fraction are officially reported. Starting in 2022, health officials only needed to report a positive test.",
