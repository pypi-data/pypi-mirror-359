    "description_summary": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports Native Americans and Alaska Natives in Washington state die of opioid overdoses at five times the state average. The state Senate unanimously approved a bill this week that would provide nearly $8 million in funding annually to combat addiction among Native Americans across dozens of tribes in the state. The bill represents a key step, but tribes such as the Lummi Nation say the funding will barely scratch the surface amid such need. The small tribe about 100 miles north of Seattle has already suffered nearly one overdose death a week this year.",

When someone appears, she and a nurse hand out the opioid overdose reversal medication naloxone.</p><p>Jefferson, a tribal member herself, knows how critical these kits are: Just five months ago, her own son died of an overdose from a synthetic opioid that\u2019s about 100 times more potent than fentanyl. The 37-year-old\u2019s death was the fourth related to opioids in four days on the reservation.</p><p>\u201cIt took us eight days to bury him because we had to wait in line, because there were so many funerals in front of his,\u201d said Jefferson, crisis outreach supervisor for Lummi Nation. \"Fentanyl has really taken a generation from this tribe.\u201d</p><p>A <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/washington-tribes-opioids-bill-funding-d2f5d1d73f9b47376df7293b9688e34d\">bill before the Washington Legislature</a> would bring more state funding to tribes like Lummi that are trying to keep opioids from taking the next generation too. The state Senate unanimously approved a bill this week that is expected to provide nearly $8 million total each year for the 29 federally recognized tribes in Washington, funds drawn in part from a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-health-seattle-washington-epidemics-8e7c50c15e10131fdb7ab17e1d63dbfd\">roughly half-billion-dollar settlement</a> between the state and major opioid distributors.</p><p>The approach comes as Native Americans and Alaska Natives in Washington die of opioid overdoses at five times the state average, according to 2021-2022 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data that includes provisional numbers. The rate in Washington is one of the highest in the U.S. and more than three times the rate nationwide \u2014 but many of the Indigenous nations in the state lack the funding or medical resources to fully address it.</p><p>Lummi Nation, like many tribes, faces an additional challenge when it comes to keeping outside drug dealers off their land: A complicated jurisdictional maze means tribal police often can\u2019t arrest non-tribal members on the reservation.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do when we have a non-Lummi, predatory drug dealer on our reservation with fentanyl, driving around or on their property and are selling drugs?\u201d said Anthony Hillaire, tribal chairman.</p><p>Against the backdrop, tribes such as the Lummi Nation, about 100 miles (161 kilometers) north of Seattle, say the proposed funding \u2014 while appreciated \u2014 would barely scratch the surface. The tribe of about 5,300 people on the shores of the Salish Sea has already suffered nearly one overdose death a week this year.</p><p>Lummi Nation needs $12 million to fully finance a 16-bed, secure medical detox facility that incorporates the tribe's culture, Hillaire said, and money to construct a new counseling center after damage from flooding. Those costs alone far exceed the annual total that would be designated for tribes under the legislation. The Senate has proposed allotting $12 million in its capital budget to the facility.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a sovereign nation. We\u2019re a self-governed tribe. We want to take care of ourselves because we know how to take care of ourselves,\" he said. \"And so we usually just need funding and law changes \u2014 good policies.\u201d</p><p>The proposed measure would earmark funds deposited into an opioid settlement account, which includes money from the state's $518 million settlement in 2022 with the nation\u2019s three largest opioid distributors, for tribes battling addiction. Tribes are expected to receive $7.75 million or 20% of the funds deposited into the account the previous fiscal year \u2014 whichever is greater \u2014 annually.</p><p>Republican state Sen. John Braun, one of the bill's sponsors, has said he envisions the funds being distributed through a grant program.</p><p>\u201cIf this ends up being the wrong amount of money or we\u2019re distributing it inequitably, I\u2019m happy to deal with this,\" he said. \u201cThis is just going to get us started, and make sure we\u2019re not sitting on our hands, waiting for the problem to solve itself.\u201d</p><p>Opioid overdose deaths for Native Americans and Alaska Natives have increased dramatically in the past few years in Washington, with at least 100 in 2022 \u2014 75 more than in 2019, according to the most recent numbers available from the Washington State Department of Health.</p><p>In September, Lummi Nation declared a state of emergency over fentanyl, adding drug-sniffing dogs and checkpoints, while revoking bail for drug-related charges.</p><p>The tribe has also opened a seven-bed facility to help members with withdrawal and get them on medication for opioid use disorder, while providing access to a neighboring cultural room where they work with cedar and sage. In its first five months, the facility treated 63 people, the majority of whom are still on the medication regimen today, said Dr. Jesse Davis, medical director of the Lummi Healing Spirit Opioid Treatment program.</p><p>But truly thwarting this crisis must go beyond just Lummi Nation working on its own, said Nickolaus Lewis, Lummi councilmember.</p><p>\u201cWe can do everything in our power to protect our people. But if they go out into Bellingham, they go out anywhere off the reservation, what good is it going to do if they have different laws and different policies, different barriers?\u201d he said.</p><p>The tribe has urged Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and President Joe Biden to declare states of emergency in response to the opioid crisis to create a bigger safety net and drive additional vital resources to the problem.</p><p>In the encampment in Bellingham, Jefferson estimates there are more than 60 tribal members, some she recognizes as her son\u2019s friends, while others are Lummi elders. She suspects many of them left the reservation to avoid the tribe's crackdown on opioids.</p><p>When she visits them, her van filled with food, hand warmers and clothing to hand out, she wears the shirt her niece gave her the day after her son died. It reads, \u201cfight fentanyl like a mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a losing battle but, you know, somebody\u2019s got to be there to let them know \u2014 those addicts \u2014 that somebody cares,\u201d Jefferson said. \u201cMaybe that one person will come to treatment because you\u2019re there to care.\u201d</p>",
