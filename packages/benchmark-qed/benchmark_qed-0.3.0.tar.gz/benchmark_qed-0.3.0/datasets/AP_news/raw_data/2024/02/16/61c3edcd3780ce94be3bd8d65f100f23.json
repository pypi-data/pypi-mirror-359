    "description_summary": "A major anti-abortion group is praising a published report that Donald Trump has privately told people he supports a national ban on abortion after 16 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 though his campaign denied the report and said Trump plans to \u201cnegotiate a deal\u201d on abortion if elected to the White House again. Trump, the front-runner to be the 2024 Republican nominee, has repeatedly refused to back any specific limits on abortion as he campaigns, though he frequently takes credit for overturning the Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. President Joe Biden says the New York Times report shows how abortion rights will be a central issue in the 2024 election. He says Trump is \u201crunning scared\u201d by not publicly saying what he would do.",

Anthony Pro-Life America, which backs a national ban on abortions at 15 weeks of pregnancy and has said anything less restrictive \u201cmakes no sense,\u201d praised Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/us/politics/trump-abortion-ban.html\">after a New York Times report</a> on Friday that he has privately been telling people he likes the idea of a federal ban on abortion after 16-weeks, with some exceptions.</p><p>\u201cPresident Trump is leading on finding consensus, and this is where the nation is,\" aid SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser.</p><p>Trump\u2019s campaign called the report \u201cFake News\u201d but did not offer details on his plans.</p><p>\u201cAs President Trump has stated, he would sit down with both sides and negotiate a deal that everyone will be happy with,\u201d Karoline Leavitt, the national press secretary for Trump\u2019s campaign, said in a statement.</p><p>Democrats and abortion-rights groups seized on the Times report, with President Joe Biden saying it showed abortion rights would be a central issue in the 2024 election. He said Trump was \u201crunning scared\u201d by not publicly saying what he would do about abortion.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s afraid the women of America are going to hold him responsible for taking away their rights and endangering their rights at the ballot box in November,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cWhich is exactly what\u2019s going to happen.\"</p><p>Polling has consistently shown that most Americans believe abortion should be legal through the initial stages of pregnancy. About half of U.S. adults said abortions should be <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-poll-roe-dobbs-ban-opinion-fcfdfc5a799ac3be617d99999e92eabe\">permitted at the 15-week mark</a>, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted last June.</p><p>Though Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America praised Trump Friday, last year the group publicly clashed with the former president when he suggested abortion restrictions should be left to individual states. The group called that a \u201cmorally indefensible position for a self-proclaimed pro-life presidential candidate.\u201d</p><p>On Friday, abortion-rights groups quickly jumped in to warn that if Trump wins in November, it will lead to restrictions nationwide.</p><p>If Trump is elected, he will \u201cwreak further havoc on our reproductive rights and personal freedoms,\u201d said Jenny Lawson, executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve long known where Donald Trump stands on abortion and it\u2019s at odds with the majority of Americans,\u201d Lawson said in a statement. \u201cHe is chiefly responsible for the ongoing public health crisis that has allowed 21 states to ban all or some abortions and yet, he claims to want to find a \u2018compromise\u2019 on this issue. To be clear, there is no compromising on the basic right to control our lives and bodies.\u201d</p><p>The Supreme Court's 2022 decision tossing out Roe left the country with a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-status-list-state-protection-ban-4466aefe6141745b71c824522aac47b9\">checkerboard of state abortion laws.</a></p><p>The former president has said he supports exceptions on abortion restrictions in cases of rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother, but he has been vague beyond that about what he would support if reelected. He has criticized a six-week ban signed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and said in an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last fall that he does not care whether abortion is banned at the federal level or left to laws in each state.</p><p>\u201cI want to get something where people are happy,\u201d Trump said in a January town hall on Fox News.</p><p>Trump\u2019s position on abortion has shifted over the years. He once declared in a 1999 interview, \u201cI am pro-choice in every respect.\u201d But in his 2016 presidential run, in which he sought to win crucial support of evangelical Republicans, he released a list of potential nominees to the Supreme Court who were considered likely to vote to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p><p>His attempts to find a middle ground suggest how challenging the issue is for Trump and most other Republican candidates. Banning or severely restricting abortion is almost a non-negotiable position for many GOP primary voters, but it's proved to be a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/virginia-legislature-election-2023-79f9337731c25decc83b83eeb4d3e00e\">losing stance in general elections</a> since the Supreme Court's decision nearly two years ago.</p><p>Some of the immediate reaction from the right to the New York Times report showed the difficulty for Trump and other Republicans trying to navigate the issue.</p><p>Students for Life Action, which opposes abortion, issued a statement skeptical of the report, but said, \u201cwe do want to hear from President Trump as there is a lot that can be done in his next administration \u2013 from appointments to administrative policies.\u201d</p><p>Kristan Hawkins, the group\u2019s president, said a limit on abortion at 16 weeks would still allow for many abortions and \u201cwill make no one happy.\u201d</p><p>After a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ballot-amendment-ban-protection-states-2024-052ff9846f8416efb725240af22b92ec\">nationwide push</a> to put <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-viability-ballot-initiatives-2024-roe-fcf440373973b01f740912cd3bbd98a4\">abortion rights questions</a> in front of voters since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the issue is expected to be <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-mental-health-ballot-maryland-missouri-arizona-6268ec88d1638009128b55fc56e3610c\">on the ballot</a> in several states this year, including Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Missouri and South Dakota.

While abortion is a health-related issue, the document's emphasis is on the political and legal aspects rather than the health implications or medical perspectives. Therefore, it is somewhat relevant to the topic of health but not highly focused on it."
