A doctor for the 81-year-old musician says that he has a major neurocognitive disorder and is taking medication for dementia. The petition asks that Wilson's publicist Jean Sievers and manager LeeAnn Hard be appointed as his conservators. A statement on Wilson's social media accounts says the decision was made after consultation with him and his seven children.",

At the time, Wilson had for years been under the close supervision of psychologist Dr. Eugene Landy.</p><p>Ledbetter and others believed Landy was exploiting and mistreating Wilson, and feuded with Landy for years before he was barred in 1992 from any contact with Wilson.</p><p>Ledbetter died unexpectedly on Jan. 30, according to a Wilson spokesperson.</p><p>\u201cOur five children and I are just in tears. We are lost,\u201d Wilson said on his <a href=\"https://www.brianwilson.com/\">web site.</a> \u201cMelinda was more than my wife. She was my savior.\"</p>",
