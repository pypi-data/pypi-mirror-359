Harry arrived from California less than 48 hours after Buckingham Palace announced on Feb. 5 that the king had cancer and had begun treatment. \u201cI love my family. The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go see and spend any time with him, I\u2019m grateful for that,\u2019\u2019 Harry told the news program \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Friday. The palace hasn't revealed the type of cancer the 75-year-old king has, and the prince wouldn\u2019t reveal any details about his father\u2019s prognosis.",
