Medical records are protected by a federal privacy law, but information collected by a lot of apps is not. State legislation is trying to close that gap. Data privacy is not a new concern, but there's been a heightened awareness since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and state abortion bans started kicking in. The Federal Trade Commission has also been using a ban on deceptive practices to sue data brokers.",

Legislation for federal bans have never gained momentum, largely because of opposition from the tech industry.</p><p>Whether that should change has become another political fault line in a nation where most Republican-controlled states have restricted abortion \u2014 including 14 with bans in place at every stage of pregnancy \u2014 and most Democratic ones have sought to protect access since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade.</p><p>Abortion rights advocates fear that that if such data is not kept private, it could be used not only in targeted ads but also in law enforcement investigations or by abortion opponents looking to harm those who seek to end pregnancies.</p><p>\u201cIt isn't just sort of creepy,\u201d said Washington state Rep. Vandana Slatter, the sponsor of a law her state adopted last year to rein in unauthorized use of health information. \u201cIt's actually harmful.\u201d</p><p>But so far, there's no evidence of widespread use of this kind of data in law enforcement investigations.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re generally talking about a future risk, not something that\u2019s happening on the ground yet,\u201d said Albert Fox Cahn, executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project and an advocate of protections.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/signed_near_letter_to_ftc_and_sec.pdf\">report last week from Sen. Ron Wyden</a>, an Oregon Democrat, showed the biggest known anti-abortion ad campaign directed to people who had been identified as having visited abortion providers.</p><p>Wyden's investigation found that the information gathered by a now-defunct data broker called Near Intelligence was used by ads from The Veritas Society, a nonprofit founded by Wisconsin Right to Life. The ads targeted people who visited 600 locations in 48 states from 2019 through 2022. There were more than 14 million ads in Wisconsin alone.</p><p>Wyden called on the Federal Trade Commission to intervene in the bankruptcy case for Near to make sure the location information collected on Americans is destroyed and not sold to another data broker. He\u2019s also asking the Securities Exchange Commission to investigate whether the company committed securities fraud by making misleading statements to investors about the senator\u2019s investigation.</p><p>It's not the first time the issue has come up.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/general-news-33f18b834c104df9b2901ef1bf38ae08\">Massachusetts reached a settlement</a> in 2017 with an ad agency that ran a similar campaign nearly a decade ago.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/technology-health-idaho-federal-trade-commission-government-and-politics-a9aabfc0d25828bc4951c736aaab617a\">FTC sued one data broker</a>, Kochava, over similar claims in 2022 in an ongoing case, and settled last month with another, X-Mode Social, and its successor, Outlogic, which the government said sold location data of even users who opted out of such sharing. X-Mode was also found to have sold location data to the U.S. military.</p><p>In both cases, the FTC relied on a law against unfair or deceptive practices.</p><p>States are also passing or considering their own laws aimed specifically at protecting sensitive health information.</p><p>Washington's Slatter, a Democrat, has worked on digital privacy issues for years, but wasn't able to get a bill with comprehensive protections adopted in her state.</p><p>She said things changed when Roe was overturned. She went to a rally in 2022 and heard women talking about deleting period-tracking apps out of fear of how their data could be exploited.</p><p>When she introduced a health-specific data privacy bill last year, it wasn't just lawyers and lobbyists testifying; women of all ages and from many walks of life showed up to support it, too.</p><p>The measure, which bars selling personal health data without a consumer's consent and prohibits tracking who visits reproductive or sexual health facilities, was adopted with the support of nearly all the state's Democratic lawmakers and opposition from all the Republicans.</p><p>Connecticut and Nevada adopted similar laws last year. New York enacted one that bars using tracking around health care facilities.</p><p>California and Maryland took another approach, enacting laws that prevent computerized health networks from sharing information about sensitive health care with other providers without consent.</p><p>\u201cWe're really pushing forward with the free-flowing and seamless exchange of health care data with the intend of having information accessible so that providers can treat the whole person,\u201d said Andrea Frey, a lawyer who represents health care providers and digital health systems across. \u201cConversely, these privacy concerns come into play.\u201d</p><p>Illinois, which already had a law limiting how health tracking data \u2014 measuring heart rates, steps and others \u2014 can be shared, adopted a new one last year that took effect Jan. 1 and that bans providing government license plate reading data to law enforcement in states with abortion bans.</p><p>Bills addressing the issue in some form have been introduced in several states this year, including Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, South Carolina and Vermont.</p><p>In Virginia, legislation that would prohibit the issuance of search warrants, subpoenas or court orders for electronic or digital menstrual health data recently cleared both chambers of the Democratic-controlled General Assembly.</p><p>Democratic Sen. Barbara Favola said she saw the bill as a necessary precaution when Republican politicians, including Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, have sought restrictions on abortion.</p><p>\u201cThe next step to enforcing an abortion ban could be accessing menstrual health data, which is why I\u2019m trying to protect that data,\u201d Favola said in a committee hearing.</p><p>Opponents asked whether such data had ever been sought by law enforcement, and Favola responded that she wasn\u2019t aware of a particular example.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just in search of a problem that does not exist,\u201d said Republican Sen. Mark Peake.</p><p>Youngkin's administration made it clear he opposed similar legislation last year, but his press office didn't respond to a request for comment on where he stands on the current version.</p><p>Sean O'Brien, founder of the Yale Privacy Lab, says there is a problem with the way health information is being used, but he's not sure laws will be the answer because companies could choose to ignore the potential consequences and continue scooping up and selling sensitive information.</p><p>\u201cThe software supply chain is extremely polluted with location tracking of individuals,\u201d he said.</p><p>___</p><p>Mulvihill reported from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.
