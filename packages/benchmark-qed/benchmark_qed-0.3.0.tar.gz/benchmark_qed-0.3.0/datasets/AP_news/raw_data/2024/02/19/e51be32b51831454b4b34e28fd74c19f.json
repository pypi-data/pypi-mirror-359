Their action Monday reportedly caused delays in surgeries and other treatments at hospitals, but no major disruptions have occured. Health authorities say it\u2019s urgent to have more doctors considering South Korea's fast-aging population. But doctors say the government must use available resources to raise medical fees and resolve other problems first. Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo expressed \u201cdeep worries\" over the trainee doctors\u2019 action. He said the government ordered them to continue working.",

They say the number of doctors in the country relative to the size of the population is among the lowest in the developed world.</p><p>But doctors\u2019 groups say the government must use available resources to raise medical fees and resolve other problems first. Some doctors say raising admissions could result in unnecessary medical treatments because of a competition among doctors and could burden the public health insurance plan.</p><p>On Monday, trainee doctors at the country\u2019s five major hospitals began submitting letters of resignation before formally walking off their jobs on Tuesday. Their association, the Korea Intern Resident Association, decided on the collective action during an emergency meeting last week.</p><p>Seoul\u2019s Asan Medical Center said that a number of interns and resident doctors there submitted resignations and that it was trying to reschedule surgeries and other treatments for some patients. Seoul\u2019s Severance Hospital said some of its trainee doctors also handed in resignations and suggested it could rearrange surgery schedules as well.</p><p>South Korean media reported that hundreds of trainee doctors at other hospitals also submitted resignations. Reports said some hospitals canceled or put off planned cancer surgeries, child births and other procedures in which trainees assist senior doctors.</p><p>No major troubles in the country's medical services were immediately reported. The Health Ministry said it was trying to find out how many of the trainee doctors at the five hospitals \u2014 estimated at about 2,700 in local media \u2014 submitted their resignations. South Korea has about 140,000 professional doctors.</p><p>The Korea Medical Association, which represents doctors, said it plans to hold rallies in support of the trainees but hasn't decided whether to join their walkouts.</p><p>Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo expressed \u201cdeep worries and regrets\u201d over the action. Park, citing a medical law, said the government ordered the trainees to continue working.</p><p>Earlier Monday, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said the government will take steps to prevent the action from undermining the care of emergency patients. He said that more than 400 emergency medical treatment centers across South Korea will stay open around the clock. He said the government will deploy military doctors if the situation worsens.</p><p>A telephone survey of 1,002 adults last week showed that 76% of the respondents said they believed the government\u2019s plan to increase medical school admissions has more positive aspects, while 16% thought it has more negative aspects, according to the polling station, the Gallup Korea. A margin of error was 3.1 percentage points.</p><p>\u201cThe collective action (by trainee doctors) is like holding the people hostages so I don\u2019t support them,\u201d Kim Sung Bum, 75, said at a Seoul train station. \u201cI think it would be desirable for them to make a compromise with the government.\u201d</p><p>__</p><p>Associated Press journalists Hyung-jin Kim and Yong Jun Chang contributed to this report.</p>",
