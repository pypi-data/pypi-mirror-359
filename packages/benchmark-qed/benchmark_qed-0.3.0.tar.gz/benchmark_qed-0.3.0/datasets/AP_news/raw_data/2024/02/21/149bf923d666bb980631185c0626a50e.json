It's the first major deliverable from the new White House Initiative on Women's Health Research. The initiative was announced last year and is led by the first lady. The $100 million is coming from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, or ARPA-H. Biden announced the ARPA-H Sprint for Women's Health during an appearance Wednesday in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The first lady says women don't know enough about their health because the research has been underfunded. She says the new White House initiative aims to change that.",
