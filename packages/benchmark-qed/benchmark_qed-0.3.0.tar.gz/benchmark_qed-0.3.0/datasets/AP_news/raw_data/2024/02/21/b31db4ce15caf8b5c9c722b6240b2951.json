Scientists don't know exactly how Alzheimer's forms but it quietly ravages the brain long before symptoms appear. Compared with people who remained healthy, researchers spotted differences in a sticky protein named amyloid 18 years before Alzheimer's patients were diagnosed. Other so-called biomarkers appeared every few years afterward. Experts say understanding the timeline of brain changes will help with testing new treatments or preventive therapies. The findings were published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",

Then every few years afterward, the study detected another so-called biomarker of brewing trouble.</p><p>Scientists don\u2019t know exactly how Alzheimer\u2019s forms. One early hallmark is that sticky protein called beta-amyloid, which over time builds up into brain-clogging plaques. Amyloid alone isn\u2019t enough to damage memory \u2014 plenty of healthy people\u2019s brains harbor a lot of plaque. An abnormal tau protein that forms neuron-killing tangles is one of several co-conspirators.</p><p>The new research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, offers a timeline for how those abnormalities pile up.</p><p>The study\u2019s importance \u201ccannot be overstated,\u201d said Dr. Richard Mayeux, an Alzheimer\u2019s specialist at Columbia University who wasn\u2019t involved in the research.</p><p>\u201cKnowledge of the timing of these physiological events is critical\u201d for testing new ways of treating and maybe eventually even preventing Alzheimer\u2019s, he wrote in an accompanying editorial.</p><p>The findings have no practical implications yet.</p><p>More than 6 million Americans, and millions more worldwide, have Alzheimer\u2019s, the most common form of dementia. There\u2019s no cure. But last year <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-medication-b42dc8b32d71f1b6892b07d85e0e7da0\">a drug named Leqembi</a> became the first approved with clear evidence that it could slow the worsening of early Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 albeit for a few months.</p><p>It works by clearing away some of that gunky amyloid protein. The approach also is being tested to see if it's possible to delay Alzheimer's onset if high-risk people are treated before symptoms appear. Still other drugs are being developed to target tau.</p><p>Tracking silent brain changes is key for such research. Scientists already knew that in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alzheimers-memory-gene-resilience-5f7c6bfb3774d9d86c018cfcdfc3f425\">rare, inherited forms of Alzheimer\u2019s</a> that strike younger people, a toxic form of amyloid starts accumulating about two decades ahead of symptoms and at some point later tau kicks in.</p><p>The new findings show the order in which such biomarker changes occurred with more common old-age Alzheimer\u2019s.</p><p>Researchers with Beijing\u2019s Innovation Center for Neurological Disorders compared 648 people eventually diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s and an equal number who remained healthy. The amyloid finding in future Alzheimer's patients was the first, 18 years or 14 years prior to diagnosis depending on the test used.</p><p>Differences in tau were detected next, followed by a marker of trouble in how neurons communicate. A few years after that, differences in brain shrinkage and cognitive test scores between the two groups became apparent, the study found.</p><p>\u201cThe more we know about viable Alzheimer\u2019s treatment targets and when to address them, the better and faster we will be able to develop new therapies and preventions,\u201d said Claire Sexton, the Alzheimer's Association's senior director of scientific programs. She noted that blood tests are coming soon that promise to also help by making it easier to track amyloid and tau.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
