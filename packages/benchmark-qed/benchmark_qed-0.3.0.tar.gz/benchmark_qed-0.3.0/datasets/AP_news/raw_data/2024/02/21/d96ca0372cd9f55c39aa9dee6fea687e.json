The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning Wednesday that applies to all such devices, regardless of brand. The warning does not apply to smartwatch apps that are linked to under-the-skin sensors that directly measure blood sugar to help people with diabetes manage the disease. About 37 million American have diabetes, which requires close monitoring of blood sugar levels. One doctor says using the unapproved devices could result in inaccurate blood sugar measurements, with potentially devastating consequences.",

People with the disease aren\u2019t able to effectively regulate their blood sugar because their bodies either don\u2019t make enough of the hormone insulin or they have become resistant to insulin.</p><p>To manage the condition, they must regularly check their blood sugar levels with a finger prick blood test or with a sensor that places needles just under the skin to monitor glucose levels continuously.</p><p>Using the unapproved smartwatch and smart ring devices could result in inaccurate blood sugar measurements, with \u201cpotentially devastating\u201d consequences, said Dr. Robert Gabbay, of the American Diabetes Association. That could cause patients to take the wrong doses of medication, leading to dangerous levels of blood sugar and possibly mental confusion, coma or even death.</p><p>Several companies are working on noninvasive devices to measure blood sugar, but none has created a product accurate and secure enough to get FDA approval, said Dr. David Klonoff, who has researched diabetes technology for 25 years.</p><p>The technology that allows smartwatches and rings to measure metrics like heart rate and blood oxygen is not accurate enough to measure blood sugar, said Klonoff, of the Sutter Health Mills-Peninsula Medical Center in San Mateo, California. Efforts to measure blood sugar in body fluids such as tears, sweat and saliva are not ready for prime time, either.</p><p>\u201cIt's challenging, and I believe at some point there will be at least one scientist or engineer to solve it,\u201d Klonoff said.</p><p>In the meantime, consumers who want to measure their blood sugar accurately can buy an FDA-cleared blood glucose monitor at any pharmacy.</p><p>\u201cIt comes down to risk. If the FDA approves it, the risk is very small,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you use a product that is not cleared by the FDA, very often the risk is very large.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
