    "description_summary": "The Alabama Supreme Court ruled last week that couples who were trying in vitro fertilization and lost frozen embryos in an accident at a south Alabama storage facility can sue under the state\u2019s wrongful death law. That decision was narrow, but legal scholars say the implications could be broad. One says that the ruling did not go as far as granting \u201cpersonhood\u201d to embryos, but that it still could resonate beyond the wrongful death law at the heart of the case. Some anti-abortion groups have pushed for \u201cpersonhood\u201d as a means of banning abortion. Because the ruling relied on Alabama's state constitution, there might not be a path to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) \u2014 The Alabama Supreme Court ruled last week that couples who were trying in vitro fertilization and lost frozen embryos in an accident at a south Alabama storage facility can sue under the state\u2019s wrongful death law.</p><p>Since then, three <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alabama-frozen-embryos-ruling-ivf-pause-3ea72dd4494cad3f65c57e751e4c5c3b\">providers have paused</a> the often-used fertility treatments while they sort out the legal implications.</p><p>The ruling is the first of its kind and extends a theory championed by some anti-abortion groups \u2014 that embryos and fetuses should be considered children and be afforded legal protections \u2014 into a new realm.</p><p>While the decision was narrow, some legal scholars think there's potential for wider impact.</p><p>Here's a look at some questions and answers about what the ruling could mean.</p><hl2>WHAT DOES THE RULING SAY?</hl2><p>The Alabama Supreme Court said three Alabama couples who lost frozen embryos during an accident at a storage facility could sue the fertility clinic and hospital for wrongful death of a minor child.</p><p>Justices reversed a lower court ruling that dismissed the wrongful death claim on the grounds that the embryos were not a person or child.</p><p>The court had previously ruled that couples could sue when a pregnant woman lost a fetus. On Friday, the court said that \u201cextrauterine children\" were also covered under the wrongful death law. \u201cUnborn children are \u2018children\u2019 under the Act, without exception based on developmental stage, physical location, or any other ancillary characteristics,\u201d Justice Jay Mitchell wrote in his opinion.</p><p>The court heavily relied on both the wording of the wrongful death statute and language added to the Alabama Constitution in 2018 stating that Alabama protects the \u201crights of the unborn child.\u201d</p><hl2>DID THE COURT GRANT \u201cPERSONHOOD\u201d TO EMBRYOS?</hl2><p>Mary Ziegler, the Martin Luther King Jr. Professor of Law at the University of California, Davis School of Law, said the Alabama ruling didn't go as far as saying embryos have all the same rights as people \u2014 at least not yet.</p><p>\u201cThe court was pretty clear that they didn\u2019t have to say whether the fetuses or embryos had constitutional rights. They were just saying that for the purposes of this wrongful death law they're persons or children,\u201d Ziegler said.</p><p>However, she said the court's decision may be read more widely.</p><p>\u201cI think people in Alabama are rightly expecting that this is the tip of the iceberg though, and this ruling will lead to more down the road,\u201d Ziegler said.</p><hl2>WHAT WILL THE RULING MEAN FOR IVF IN ALABAMA?</hl2><p>Three IVF clinics in the state announced they were pausing IVF services as they sort out the ruling. Another clinic said it would continue to provide IVF services, but might adjust consent forms for patients, among other possible changes.</p><p>Patients at clinics where IVF has been paused scrambled to find other providers.</p><p>In the meantime, the legal and practical fallout from the Alabama Supreme Court ruling is unclear.</p><p>Greer Donley, an associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, said that she expects clinics to offer IVF in Alabama, but believes that they may choose not to store embryos in the state in the future.</p><p>Moving them elsewhere could, however, increase the logistical hurdles, cost and risk involved with the process.</p><hl2>WHAT IS THE STATE OF PLAY FOR LEGAL CHALLENGES?</hl2><p>Legal scholars expect more cases to develop on rights for embryos.</p><p>It's also possible that last week\u2019s ruling was the final say on this Alabama case.</p><p>State supreme court cases can be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 but only when they rely on the U.S. Constitution.</p><p>This ruling relies heavily on the Alabama Constitution, including language that the state recognizes the rights of the \u201cunborn.\u201d</p><hl2>ARE LAWMAKERS CONSIDERING ACTION IN RESPONSE TO THE RULING?</hl2><p>Republican state Sen. Tim Melson said he intends to file legislation to protect IVF services in the state. Melson, who is a medical doctor, said the legislation seeks to say that a fertilized egg has legal protections under the statute after it is implanted in the uterus \u2014 but not before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to come up with a solution for the IVF industry and protect the doctors and still make it available for people who have fertility issues that need to be addressed because they want to have a family,\u201d Melson said.</p><p>He said the ruling is an unintended consequence of the language that lawmakers and voters added to Alabama Constitution saying it is state policy to recognize the rights of the \"unborn.\"</p><p>\u201cWe need to address it,\u201d Melson said.</p><hl2>WILL THE PERSON WHO CAUSED THE ACCIDENT BE CRIMINALLY CHARGED?</hl2><p>No. At least not under the ruling.</p><p>The Alabama case revolves around civil wrongful death claims, not criminal charges over the death of embryos.</p><p>Law professor Zeigler said the ruling was limited to the scope of the wrongful death statute. \u201cThe court was saying we\u2019re leaving for another day whether this embryo has constitutional rights and whether you could prosecute people who kill embryos for murder.\"</p><hl2>WHAT HAPPENS TO EMBRYOS AFTER A DIVORCE?</hl2><p>Currently, they could remain in storage indefinitely. Many embryos do \u2014 for myriad reasons.</p><p>Even before the Alabama ruling, what to do with embryos that are not implanted was a conundrum, including for people who used IVF to become parents.</p><p>Some can\u2019t bring themselves to donate embryos for research or have them destroyed \u2013 and don\u2019t want to continue paying storage fees. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/046d6fbc4c564caebac7e560cd87a26a\">Thousands are abandoned</a> in clinic freezers already.</p><p>What happens as a result of the new ruling is murky, said Rachel Rebouche, dean of the Temple University Beasley School of Law in Philadelphia. She noted that employers sometimes pay to store embryos for employees.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re in Alabama, is that benefit now meaningless,\u201d she asked, \u201cbecause if you choose not to implant those embryos, you\u2019re going to be accused of a tort?\u201d</p><p>One movement calls for people who don\u2019t plan to use embryos for further pregnancies to do what they call \u201ccompassionate transfer\u201d and implant them into women\u2019s uteruses at a time when the pregnancy is unlikely to occur. ___</p><p>Associated Press reporter Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, contributed to this article.</p>",
