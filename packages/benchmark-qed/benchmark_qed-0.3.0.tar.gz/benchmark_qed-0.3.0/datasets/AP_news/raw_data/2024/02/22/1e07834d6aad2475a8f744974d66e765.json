A summary autopsy released this week shows Nex Benedict had toxic levels of drugs in their system and died of an overdose on Feb. 8 after a fight with several girls inside a high school restroom. Owasso police say a complete autopsy report will be released in about 10 days. After that, police will forward the results of their investigation to the district attorney's office for possible criminal charges.",

They did not dispute the coroner's report finding of a suicide.</p><p>\u201cRather than allow incomplete accounts to take hold and spread any further, the Benedicts feel compelled to provide a summary of those findings which have not yet been released by the Medical Examiner\u2019s office, particularly those that contradict allegations of the assault on Nex being insignificant,\u201d the statement said.</p><p>The findings shared by the family from the complete autopsy report also showed contusions and lacerations to the teen's face and head, injuries to the back of the left hand and abrasions to the chest that the coroner said are consistent with efforts to administer CPR.</p><p>On Thursday, a day after the death was ruled a suicide, President Joe Biden released a statement saying he and First Lady Jill Biden were \u201cheartbroken\u201d over the loss. \u201cNex Benedict, a kid who just wanted to be accepted, should still be here with us today.\"</p><p>About 100 people marched around the Oklahoma Capitol on Thursday as part of a rally in support of Benedict, organized by a LGBTQ+ group.</p><p>Here are some things to know about Benedict's death and the investigation:</p><hl2>WHAT'S THE TIMELINE FOR THE POLICE INVESTIGATION</hl2><p>Owasso Police Lt. Nick Boatman said Thursday the police investigation into Nex\u2019s death, including the fight inside the bathroom, won\u2019t be complete until their office receives the final autopsy report.</p><p>At that point, Boatman said the findings will be submitted to the Tulsa County District Attorney\u2019s Office to determine what charges, if any, may be filed.</p><p>Tulsa County District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler on Thursday declined to comment on the case until after he\u2019s seen the entire law enforcement report.</p><p>\u201cWhen they say they\u2019re finished their investigation, we\u2019ll review what materials they have,\u201d Kunzweiler said.</p><hl2>WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SCHOOL BATHROOM</hl2><p>In video footage from the hospital the day of the altercation, Feb. 7, Benedict explains to an officer that three girls had been picking on them and their friends because of the way they dressed. Benedict, who used they/them pronouns, claims that in the bathroom the students said \u201csomething like: why do they laugh like that,\u201d referring to Benedict and their friends.</p><p>\u201cAnd so I went up there and I poured water on them, and then all three of them came at me,\u201d Benedict tells the officer from a hospital bed.</p><p>\u201cThey came at me. They grabbed on my hair. I grabbed onto them. I threw one of them into a paper towel dispenser and then they got my legs out from under me and got me on the ground,\u201d Benedict says in the video, adding that the girls then started beating Benedict and they blacked out.</p><p>The next day, paramedics responded to a 911 call at the family\u2019s house and performed CPR on the teen before rushing them to the hospital, where they later died. The autopsy determined the cause of death to be an overdose of drugs.</p><hl2>HOW HAVE PEOPLE RESPONDED</hl2><p>Benedict's death has prompted an outpouring of supportive messages from political and social leaders across the country.</p><p>On Thursday, Biden said, \u201cIn memory of Nex, we must all recommit to our work to end discrimination and address the suicide crisis impacting too many nonbinary and transgender children. Bullying is hurtful and cruel, and no one should face the bullying that Nex did. Parents and schools must take reports of bullying seriously.\u201d</p><p>A bipartisan group of Oklahoma legislators also released a joint statement Thursday in which they said Benedict's death was a \u201charsh reminder of the power that words have.\u201d</p><p>\"As public officials and policy makers, we have a sacred obligation to ensure that as we do the work of the people, we do so with respect and dignity. We call on all Oklahomans to join us in our commitment to being respectful and deliberate in our language.\u201d</p><hl2>WHERE ARE CALLS TO YOUTH CRISIS HOTLINES SPIKING</hl2><p>After news of Benedict's death became public, calls from Oklahoma to a national crisis hotline for LGBTQ+ youths spiked by more than 500%, said Lance Preston, the founder and director of the Indiana-based Rainbow Youth Project USA, a group that aims to improve the safety and wellness of LGBTQ+ young people.</p><p>The group's mental health crisis hotline typically receives an average of 87 calls per week from Oklahoma, a number that jumped to 474 calls in the week after Benedict's death was reported, Preston said.</p><p>For the month of February, calls to the hotline from Oklahoma outpaced calls from Texas and Florida, the two states that have topped the list of calls since the hotline was established several years ago, Preston said.</p><p>Trans and LGBTQ+ youth are particularly susceptible to suicidal ideation because they often face discrimination, bigotry and a lack of acceptance from their families and communities, Preston said.</p><p>\u201cWe have seen crises increase with school board policies or where school boards are considering policies like forced outing ... bathroom policies, ban on athletics, all those things,\u201d Preston said. \u201cBecause it makes these kids feel like: \u2018I\u2019m not wanted. My government hates me. I'm not wanted here.'\u201d</p><hl2>WHAT ARE THE ANTI-TRANS LAWS IN OKLAHOMA</hl2><p>In recent years Oklahoma\u2019s Republican-led Legislature has passed several new laws targeting transgender and nonbinary people, including bills that prohibit children from <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-gender-affirming-care-ban-oklahoma-d794292d81050ac16a8cf2564e66277e\">receiving gender-affirming medical care</a> and prohibiting the use of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-health-oklahoma-city-20e3343b93688ac7c3e14a9a4c1c95f9\">nonbinary gender markers</a> on birth certificates.</p><p>Republican Gov.

While it touches on mental health issues, particularly the impact of bullying and discrimination on LGBTQ+ youth, the main focus is not on health in a broader sense. The document does mention the spike in calls to a mental health crisis hotline and the susceptibility of trans and LGBTQ+ youth to suicidal ideation, which are relevant to mental health. However, the overall content is more centered on the specific incident, the investigation, and the social and political context rather than health as a primary topic."
