The Myna Mahila Foundation has recruited 80 test users to help train the chatbot how to answer questions about sexual reproductive health. The chatbot runs on OpenAI's ChatGPT model and also draws on a database of medical information. Suhani Jalota is the founder and CEO of the foundation. She says the chatbot could provide women with accurate, nonjudgmental and private advice about their reproductive health, which is currently difficult for them to access.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Komal Vilas Thatkare says she doesn't have anyone to ask about her most private health questions.</p><p>\u201cThere are only men in my home \u2014 no ladies,\" said the 32-year-old mother and housewife in Mumbai. \"I don\u2019t speak to anyone here. So I used this app as it helps me in my personal problems.\u201d</p><p>The app she uses is powered by artificial intelligence running on OpenAI\u2019s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/what-is-chat-gpt-ac4967a4fb41fda31c4d27f015e32660\">ChatGPT model</a>, that Myna Mahila Foundation, a local women's organization, is developing. Thatkare asks the Myna Bolo chatbot questions and it offers answers. Through those interactions, Thatkare learned about a contraceptive pill and how to take it.</p><p>Thatkare is one of 80 test users the foundation recruited to help train the chatbot. It draws on a customized database of medical information about sexual health, but the chatbot's potential success relies on test users like Thatkare to train it.</p><p>The chatbot, currently a pilot project, represents what many hope will be part of the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ai-chatbots-racist-medicine-chatgpt-bard-6f2a330086acd0a1f8955ac995bdde4d\">impact of AI on health care</a> around the globe: to deliver accurate medical information in personalized responses that can reach many more people than in-person clinics or trained medical workers. In this case, the chatbot's focus on reproductive health also offers vital information that \u2014 because of social norms \u2014 is difficult to access elsewhere.</p><p>\u201cIf this actually could provide this nonjudgmental, private advice to women, then it could really be a gamechanger when it comes to accessing information about sexual reproductive health,\u201d said Suhani Jalota, founder and CEO of the Myna Mahila Foundation, which received a $100,000 grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation last summer to develop the chatbot, as part of a cohort of organizations in low- and middle-income countries trying to use AI to solve problems in their communities.</p><p>Funders like the Gates Foundation, the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation and Data.org, are seeking to build up this \u201cmissing middle\u201d in AI development, especially in areas like health and education. These philanthropic initiatives offer developers access to AI tools they otherwise could not afford so they can solve problems that are a low priority for corporations and researchers \u2014 if they are on their radars at all \u2014 because they don't have high profit potential.</p><p>\u201cNo longer can the global north and high-income countries drive the agenda and decide what does and does not need to be addressed in local communities in the global south,\u201d wrote Trevor Mundel, president for global health at the Gates Foundation in an October <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/trevormundel_we-are-in-the-midst-of-transformative-change-activity-7114718623809601537-le5W/\">online post</a>, adding, \u201cWe cannot risk creating another chasm of inequity when it comes to AI.\u201d</p><p>The Associated Press receives financial support for news coverage in Africa from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.</p><p>The Myna Mahila Foundation recruited test users like Thatkare to write real questions they have. For example, \u201cDoes using a condom cause HIV?\u201d or \u201cCan I have sex during periods?\" The foundation's staff then closely monitor the chatbot's responses, developing a customized database of verified questions and answers along the way that helps improve future responses.</p><p>The chatbot is not yet ready for wider release. The accuracy of its responses is not good enough and there are issues with translation, Jalota said. Users often write questions in a mix of languages and may not provide the chatbot with enough information for it to offer a relevant response.</p><p>\u201cWe are not yet fully sure on whether or not women can understand everything clearly and whether or not it\u2019s fully medically accurate all of the information that we\u2019re sending out,\u201d Jalota said. They are considering training some women to help ask the chatbot prompts on behalf of someone else, though still aim to improve the chatbot so it can be released on its own.</p><p>Dr. Christopher Longhurst, chief medical officer at the UC San Diego Health, has led the implementation of AI tools in health care settings and said it is important to test and measure the impact of these new tools on patient health outcomes.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just assume or trust or hope that these things are going to be good. You actually have to test it,\u201d Longhurst said. He thinks the promise of AI in health care is overestimated in the next two to three years, \u201cBut I think long term, over the next decade, AI is going to be as impactful as the introduction of penicillin in health care.\u201d</p><p>Jalota\u2019s team consulted with other projects funded by the Gates Foundation that were designing chatbots for health care settings so they could solve similar problems together, said Zameer Brey, interim deputy director for technology diffusion for the Gates Foundation.</p><p>The Myna Mahila Foundation is also partnering with another Gates grantee to propose developing privacy standards for handling data for reproductive health. The foundation, which is working with an outside technology firm to develop the chatbot, is also considering other steps to help ensure the privacy of users.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been discussing whether we should delete messages within a certain time frame of women sending it to add to this privacy,\u201d Jalota said, as some women share phones with family members.</p><p>___</p><p>AP Technology Writer Matt O\u2019Brien contributed from Providence, Rhode Island.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

It focuses on how the chatbot is being trained to provide accurate medical information, particularly about reproductive health, to women who may not have access to such information otherwise. The document also touches on the broader implications of AI in health care and the importance of testing and measuring the impact of these tools on patient health outcomes. Given that the document is centered around health care applications of AI and the specific health needs of women, it is highly relevant to the topic of health."
