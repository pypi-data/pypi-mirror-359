Most importantly she maintains her trademark sense of humor and is receiving the care she requires to make sure she is protected and that her needs are addressed. She is appreciative of the many kind thoughts and good wishes being sent her way,\u201d the statement attributed to her care team said.</p><p>The statement on Williams\u2019 health was issued on PR Newswire. A representative listed on the release, Jennifer Hanley, referred questions back to the statement when contacted by The Associated Press.</p><p>The announcement came a day after a <a href=\"https://people.com/wendy-williams-family-break-their-silence-shocking-and-heartbreaking-struggles-over-past-3-years-exclusive-8585052\">cover story in People magazine</a> quoted Williams\u2019 family about the nature of her struggles, ahead of a Lifetime documentary set to air Saturday.</p><p>\u201cThe people who love her cannot see her,\u201d People quoted Williams\u2019 sister Wanda as saying. \u201cI think the big (question) is: How the hell did we get here?\u201d The family said a court-appointed legal guardian was the only person with unfettered access to Williams.</p><p>The article said the Lifetime documentary crew, which set out in 2022 to chronicle Williams\u2019 comeback, stopped filming in April 2023 when, her manager \u201cand jeweler\u201d Will Selby says in footage for the film, she entered a facility to treat \u201ccognitive issues.\u201d Her son says in the documentary that doctors had connected her cognitive issues to alcohol use, People reported.</p><p>Her family told People they don\u2019t know where she is and cannot call her themselves, but she can call them.</p><p>The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration describes FTD as a group of brain disorders caused by degeneration of the frontal and/or temporal lobes of the brain that affects behavior, language and movement. Aphasia, a brain disorder that can lead to problems speaking or understanding words, can be a symptom of it. The association describes frontotemporal degeneration as \u201can inevitable decline in functioning,\u201d with an average life expectancy of seven to 13 years after the onset of symptoms.</p><p>FTD usually occurs in people in their 40s, 50s and early 60s. It <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wendy-williams-dementia-diagnosis-ftd-736b2a721d7b0a3e515e34c9cb997937\">can affect a person\u2019s personality</a>, causing a loss of inhibition or inappropriate behavior. It is sometimes mistaken for depression or bipolar disorder, and can take years to diagnose.</p><p>There are no treatments to slow or stop the disease, but some interventions can help <a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-are-frontotemporal-disorders#treatment\">manage symptoms</a>.</p><p>The association was involved in the disclosure of Willis' diagnosis in February 2023, hosting a statement posted by the actor's family.</p><p>\u201cWe thank Wendy Williams for having the courage to make her diagnosis public and raise awareness of the disease,\u201d association CEO Susan Dickinson said in a statement. \u201c\u201dWe know that a diagnosis like this can be heartbreaking, but she is not alone. While there may not be a cure, every day we are working to improve care and research into treatments for this disease.\u201d</p><p>Thursday's statement credited Weill Cornell Medicine in New York with the care and expertise Williams received. Weill Cornell declined comment.</p><p>Williams rose to fame in part due to her no-boundaries approach to her life, which included sharing personal details about her health, plastic surgery and cocaine addiction \u2014 the subject of her 2003 memoir, \u201cWendy's Got the Heat.\u201d</p><p>A hallmark of \u201cThe Wendy Williams Show,\u201d which competed for viewers with Ellen DeGeneres' show, was her signature phrase, \u201cHow you doin\u2019?\" She transitioned to television after a successful career as a radio host, known for her hot takes on gossip and skewering of celebrities, including a contentious 2003 interview with Whitney Houston.</p><p>In 2022, Williams' self-titled daytime talk show ended because of her ongoing health issues. Sherri Shepherd, who filled in for Williams as a guest host, received her own show.</p><p>Williams said in 2018 that she had been diagnosed years before with Graves\u2019 disease, which leads to the overproduction of thyroid hormones and can cause wide-ranging symptoms and affect overall health.</p>",
