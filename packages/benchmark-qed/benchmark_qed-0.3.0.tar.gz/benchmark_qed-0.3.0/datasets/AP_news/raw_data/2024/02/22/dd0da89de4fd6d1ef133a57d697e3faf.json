    "description_summary": "South Dakota\u2019s Republican-led Legislature is trying to thwart a proposed ballot initiative that would enable voters to protect abortion rights in the state constitution. The House and Senate overwhelmingly approved a resolution rebuking the ballot measure. Another bill would allow initiative petition signers to remove their signatures. Still another would create an informational video about the state\u2019s abortion laws. South Dakota currently outlaws all abortions unless to save the life of the mother. The initiative has drawn more than 50,000 signatures. It requires 35,017 validated signatures to make the November ballot. The initiative\u2019s leader says the GOP efforts threaten the state\u2019s tradition of direct democracy.",

(AP) \u2014 South Dakota's Republican-led Legislature is trying to thwart a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-south-dakota-sd-state-wire-constitutions-49618de8441cf8813ff64266cccc192d\">proposed ballot initiative</a> that would enable voters to protect abortion rights in the state constitution. The initiative's leader says the GOP efforts threaten the state's tradition of direct democracy.</p><p>Supporters need about 35,000 valid signatures submitted by May 7 to qualify for the November ballot. Dakotans for Health co-founder Rick Weiland said they already have more than 50,000.</p><p>Republican lawmakers say the language is too extreme and overwhelmingly adopted a <a href=\"https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/25022/265688\">resolution opposing the initiative</a> after grilling Weiland during a committee hearing.</p><hl2>INITIATIVE WOULD ALLOW MOST ABORTIONS</hl2><p>South Dakota outlaws all abortions except to save the life of the mother under a trigger ban that took effect in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0\">overruled Roe v. Wade.</a></p><p>If voters approve it, the three-paragraph addition to the South Dakota Constitution would ban the state from regulating abortion in the first trimester and allow regulations for the second trimester \u201conly in ways that are reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman.\u201d The state could regulate or prohibit third-trimester abortions, \u201cexcept when abortion is necessary, in the medical judgment of the woman\u2019s physician, to preserve the life or health of the pregnant woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe looked at the rights that women had for 50 years under Roe v. Wade, basically took that language and used it in our amendment,\u201d Weiland said.</p><p>Seven states have had <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ballot-amendment-ban-protection-states-2024-052ff9846f8416efb725240af22b92ec\">abortion-related ballot measures since the Dobbs decision</a>, and voters favored abortion rights in all of them. Four of those -- in California, Michigan, Ohio and Vermont -- enshrined abortion rights in their constitutions.</p><hl2>WHAT HAS BEEN THE RESPONSE?</hl2><p>The South Dakota Legislature's resolution opposing the initiative says the measure \u201cwould severely restrict any future enactment of protections for a pregnant woman, her child, and her healthcare providers,\" and \u201cwould fail to protect human life, would fail to protect a pregnant woman, and would fail to protect the child she bears.\u201d</p><p>Republican House Majority Leader Will Mortenson said they approved the resolution to help the public by pointing out \u201csome of the unintended or intended, maybe, consequences of the measure so that the public could see what it does in practical effect.\u201d</p><p>Republican Rep. Jon Hansen \u2014 who co-chairs the Life Defense Fund, formed to defeat the initiative \u2014 said its language goes too far and \u201cbans reasonable, commonsense, bipartisan protections that this state has had in place for decades.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Roe v. Wade was the law of the land, we could at least have protections to say if there's going to be an abortion, it needs to be done by a physician, under a physician's supervision, in an inspected facility,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cYou can't have those protections in the first trimester of this proposed constitutional amendment. That's insane. That's way too extreme.\u201d</p><p>Weiland said the language conforms with Roe v. Wade and efforts to say otherwise are misleading and ill-informed.</p><p>Democratic House Minority Leader Oren Lesmeister said voters, not lawmakers, should decide. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Reynold Nesiba also supports the initiative.</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, however, is not supporting the initiative, telling its supporters in a December email that the language \"isn\u2019t sufficient to restore abortion access in South Dakota.\u201d</p><hl2>TRYING TO REMOVE SIGNATURES</hl2><p>The South Dakota House on Tuesday passed <a href=\"https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/24649\">a bill by Hansen</a> that would allow signers of initiative petitions to withdraw their signatures. It now goes to the Senate.</p><p>Hansen said the bill is about people being misled or \u201cfraudulently induced\" to sign petitions. Weiland said Hansen's bill is an attack on direct democracy. Hansen said, \u201cThis is a right squarely in the hands of the person who signed; if they want to withdraw, they can withdraw.\u201d</p><p>Democratic lawmakers on Thursday brought up concerns about potential abuses and class-action lawsuits over signature removals. They said state laws already exist to ensure ballot initiatives are done properly.</p><hl2>A VIDEO FOR DOCTORS</hl2><p>The Senate will soon weigh <a href=\"https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/24959\">a House-passed bill</a> that would require the state Department of Health, which answers to Republican Gov. Kristi Noem, to create an informational video, with consultation from the state attorney general and legal and medical experts, describing how the state\u2019s abortion laws should be applied.</p><p>Republican Rep. Taylor Rehfeldt said she brought the bill to provide clarification after questions from providers about when they can intervene to save a pregnant woman's life. The purpose is to \"just talk about women's health, what the law says and what the health care and legal professional opinions are, surrounding what our law currently says,\u201d Rehfeldt said.</p><p>Weiland said he is skeptical, not knowing what the video would include.</p><p>\u201cHopefully it's enough guidance for doctors to be able to make these medical decisions,\u201d he said.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Geoff Mulvihill contributed from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.</p>",
