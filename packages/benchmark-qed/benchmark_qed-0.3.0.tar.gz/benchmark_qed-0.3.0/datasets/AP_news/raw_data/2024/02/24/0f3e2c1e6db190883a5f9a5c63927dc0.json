Francis was scheduled to meet with Rome deacons on Saturday morning. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said that the pope\u2019s weekly Sunday Angelus address was still to be confirmed. No further health updates were expected for the day. The 87-year-old pontiff has had several health problems in recent years. He was forced to cancel some of his activities and an international trip in late November because of breathing problems. A scan at the time ruled out lung complications. Francis had a part of one lung removed when he was young and still living in his native Argentina.",

He was discharged after receiving intravenous antibiotics.</p><p>Francis also spent 10 days at the same hospital in July 2021 following intestinal surgery for narrowing of the bowel. He was readmitted in June 2023 for <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/vatican-pope-health-758c3d7b07e6d6f242c4a5ea6f2de154\">an operation</a> to repair an abdominal hernia and remove scarring from previous surgeries.</p><p>When asked about his health in a recent television interview, Francis quipped what has become his standard line: \u201cStill alive, you know.\u201d</p><p>Over the past two years, Francis has indicated several times that he would be ready to step down, following the example of his predecessor, Benedict XVI, if his health deteriorates to the point that it becomes an impediment to him leading the Catholic Church. However, in a TV interview last month, he said he felt in good health and denied immediate plans to resign.</p><p>Speculation about Francis\u2019 health and the future of his pontificate has risen following Benedict's death in late 2022. Benedict's resignation in 2013 marked a turning point for the church, as he became the first pontiff in six centuries to step down.</p>",
