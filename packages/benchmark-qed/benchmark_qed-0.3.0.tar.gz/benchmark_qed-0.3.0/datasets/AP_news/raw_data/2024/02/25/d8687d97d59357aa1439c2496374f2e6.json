Francis over the past few months had to cancel some of his activities and one international trip due to fragile health. He appeared in good shape on Sunday as he concluded his Angelus prayer with his usual salutes to the waving crowd. In his address, Francis remembered \u201cwith sorrow\u201d the second anniversary of the start of what he called \u201ca large-scale war in Ukraine.\u201d",
