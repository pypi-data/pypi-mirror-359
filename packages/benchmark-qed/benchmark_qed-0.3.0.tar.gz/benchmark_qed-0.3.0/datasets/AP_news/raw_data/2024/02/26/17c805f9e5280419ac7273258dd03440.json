It says they won't be punished if they return by Thursday, but warns they will face indictments and suspensions of their medical licenses if they don't meet the deadline. About 9,000 medical interns and residents have stayed off the job since early last week to protest a government plan to increase medical school admissions by about two-thirds. The walkouts have disrupted the operations of their hospitals. Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo said Monday that those who don't return to work by Thursday will be punished with a minimum three-month suspension of their medical licenses and face investigations and possible indictments.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Junior doctors in South Korea have four days to end their walkouts or they will have their medical licenses suspended and face prosecution, the government said Monday.</p><p>About 9,000 <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-doctors-protest-government-medical-school-e51be32b51831454b4b34e28fd74c19f\">medical interns and residents</a> have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-trainee-doctors-walk-off-d991fc8a07c535ea737b4f31b01c5658\">stayed off the job</a> since early last week to protest a government plan to increase medical school admissions by about 65%. The walkouts have severely hurt the operations of their hospitals, with numerous cancellations of surgeries and other treatments.</p><p>Government officials say adding more doctors is necessary to deal with South Korea\u2019s rapidly aging population. The country\u2019s current doctor-to-patient ratio is among the lowest in the developed world.</p><p>The strikers say universities can\u2019t handle so many new students and argue the plan would not resolve a chronic shortage of doctors in some key but low-paying areas like pediatrics and emergency departments.</p><p>Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo said during a televised briefing Monday that the government won\u2019t seek <a href=\"South Korea\u2019s doctor-to-patient ratio is among the lowest in the developed world.\">any disciplinary action</a> against striking doctors if they return to work by Thursday.</p><p>\u201cWe want them to return to work by the end of this month, Feb. 29. If they return to the hospitals they had left by then, we won\u2019t hold them responsible\u201d for any damage caused by their walkouts, Park said. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late. Please, return to patients immediately.\u201d</p><p>But he said those who don\u2019t meet the deadline will be punished with a minimum three-month suspension of their medical licenses and face further legal steps such as investigations and possible indictments.</p><p>Under South Korea\u2019s medical law, the government can issue back-to-work orders to doctors and other medical personnel when it sees grave risks to public health. Refusing to abide by such an order can bring suspensions of their licenses and up to three years in prison or a 30 million won ($22,480) fine. Those who receive prison sentences would be stripped of their medical licenses.</p><p>Hyeondeok Choi, a partner at the law firm Daeryun which specializes in medical law, said it\u2019s highly unlikely the government will suspend the licenses of all doctors on strike, as that would cause \u201can enormous medical vacuum.\u201d Other observers said authorities would likely punish strike leaders.</p><p>There are about 13,000 medical interns and residents in South Korea, most of them working and training at 100 hospitals. They typically assist senior doctors during surgeries and deal with inpatients. They represent about 30% to 40% of total doctors at some major hospitals.</p><p>The Korea Medical Association, which represents about 140,000 doctors, has said it supports the striking doctors but hasn\u2019t determined whether to join the trainee doctors\u2019 walkouts. Senior doctors have held a series of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-doctors-protest-medical-school-students-d6e52e839a20c92757ec9a3a89cf480b\">rallies</a> voicing opposition to the government\u2019s plan in recent days.</p><p>Earlier this month, the government announced universities would admit 2,000 more medical students starting next year, from the current 3,058. The government says it aims to add up to 10,000 doctors by 2035.</p><p>Striking doctors have said they worry doctors faced with increased competition would engage in overtreatment, burdening public medical expenses.</p><p>A public survey showed that about 80% of South Koreans back the plan. Critics suspect doctors, one of the best-paid professions in South Korea, oppose the recruitment plan because they worry they would face greater competition and lower incomes.</p><p>Park said the country\u2019s medical services for emergency and critical patients remain stable, with public medical facilities extending their working hours and military hospitals opening emergency rooms to ordinary patients. But local media reported that an octogenarian suffering a cardiac arrest was declared dead last Friday after seven hospitals turned her away citing a lack of medical staff or other reasons likely related to the walkouts.</p><p>Hwang Byung-tae, a 55-year-old laryngeal cancer patient, said he has regularly visited a Seoul hospital for treatment for four years. Last week, he said he had to leave the hospital without receiving an anti-cancer injection because of the walkouts.</p><p>Hwang accused both the government and doctors of holding the lives of patients hostage. \u201cIt\u2019s patients like me who end up suffering and dying, not them,\u201d Hwang said.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Jiwon Song contributed to this report.</p>",
