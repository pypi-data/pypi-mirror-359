The Vatican press office made the announcement in a short statement on Monday, adding that the pontiff did not have a fever. The statement indicated the decision was made as a precautionary measure. Pope Francis was well enough on Sunday to celebrate his weekly Angelus prayer from the Vatican window overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square, a day after canceling a public audience because of a mild flu-like condition. The Vatican calendar has no public audiences scheduled for the Pope on Monday morning, but he may have had other private engagements.",
