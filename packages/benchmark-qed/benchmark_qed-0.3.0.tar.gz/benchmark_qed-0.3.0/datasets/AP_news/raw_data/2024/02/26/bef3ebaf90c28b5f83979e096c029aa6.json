The religious exemption is included in a bill that would let private schools decide whether to implement vaccine mandates. The overall bill approved Monday now goes to the state Senate. Some medical experts say the bill would weaken safeguards in vaccination policies. Republican Todd Kirby says the bill sends a message about existing guarantees of religious freedom. He says it would also give unvaccinated children the chance to have important social interactions in schools and day-care facilities.",

(AP) \u2014 West Virginia would join 45 other states that allow religious <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/vaccination-exemptions-children-cdc-951427e55b24c8e7eb3a23b26946f630\">exemptions from childhood vaccines</a> required for school attendance under a bill that passed the House of Delegates on Monday.</p><p>The religious exemption is included in a bill that would let private schools decide whether to implement vaccine mandates. It was added to the bill as an amendment that passed on Friday. The overall bill was approved Monday on a 57-41 vote and now goes to the state Senate, where its chances of passage are uncertain. But the Senate will have to act quickly: the 60-day regular session ends on March 9.</p><p>Some medical experts in West Virginia, one of the unhealthiest states in the nation among adults, called the bill archaic.</p><p>\u201cLegislators want to turn the clock back nearly 100 years and remove some of the safeguards in our vaccination policies,\u201d said Dr. Steven Eshenaur, the health officer for the Kanawha-Charleston health department. \u201cIt escapes sound reasoning why anyone would want to weaken childhood immunization laws. Our children are more important than any agenda that would bring these horrific diseases back to the Mountain State.\u201d</p><p>The bill\u2019s original intent was to eliminate vaccine requirements for students in public virtual schools. It was expanded in committee to allow private schools to set their own vaccination standards. Then came the religious exemption added in last week's amendment.</p><p>Amendment sponsor Todd Kirby, a Raleigh County Republican, said the exemption sends a message about existing guarantees of religious freedom. Kirby, who said his children are fully vaccinated, added that it would allow unvaccinated children to be welcomed into schools and day-care facilities and \u201cto have the camaraderie and social interactions that we all know are so important.\u201d</p><p>Last year, Kirby co-sponsored a bill later <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/lgbtq-discrimination-religious-freedom-west-virginia-1301d525c95eb4b826dd38c05f62b65b\">signed by Republican Gov. Jim Justice</a> that would create a test for courts to apply when people challenge government regulations they believe interfere with their constitutional right to religious freedom. About two dozen other states have similar laws.</p><p>A federal appeals court last August upheld a 2021 Connecticut law that eliminated the state\u2019s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/connecticut-religion-health-education-government-and-politics-6d9ce916908bbdacce4e7a7840a57a87\">longstanding religious exemption</a> from childhood immunization requirements for schools, colleges and day care facilities. And in Mississippi, a federal judge <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mississippi-vaccines-religion-747269fe3edcc20530a9aa17e6ad1a3b\">ruled in April 2023</a> that the state must allow such exemptions.</p><p>Other states that currently don\u2019t have religious exemptions for school immunization requirements are California, Maine and New York, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p><p>Unless they have a valid medical excuse, children entering school for the first time in West Virginia currently must be immunized against nine diseases or infections, including chickenpox, measles, whooping cough and tetanus.</p><p>Kanawha County Republican JB Akers said he supports the religious exemption but doesn\u2019t like how the bill would let private schools decide on student vaccine requirements while public school students currently must be immunized.</p><p>\u201cI think we are potentially creating an equal protection problem,\u201d he said in voting against the bill.</p><p>Students who compete in state-sponsored athletic competitions must be immunized and cannot receive a religious exemption under the bill.</p><p>Kanawha County Democrat Mike Pushkin chided the House for meddling with the current school vaccine law.</p><p>\u201cWe do not have the right to harm others,\u201d Pushkin said. \u201cThis bill does harm.\u201d</p><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, West Virginia\u2019s life expectancy in 2020 was 72.8 years. Only Mississippi\u2019s was lower at 71.9. West Virginia has the nation\u2019s highest death rate from diabetes and heart disease, and has long had the nation\u2019s highest drug-related death rate. It was among three states with an obesity prevalence of 40% or greater in adults in 2022, the CDC said.</p>",
