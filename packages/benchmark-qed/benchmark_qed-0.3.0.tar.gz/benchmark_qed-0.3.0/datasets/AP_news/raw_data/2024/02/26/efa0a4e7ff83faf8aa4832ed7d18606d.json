Maura Healey ripped into the financially embattled Steward Health Care system on Monday, saying the company\u2019s financial woes are of its own making and that the state is still working toward what she called an orderly transition away from the company. Healey said state Department of Health monitors are keeping an eye on the nine health care facilities operated by the company, including hospitals in some of the state\u2019s poorer communities. The Democrat also said she\u2019s demanded that Steward guarantee safe staffing levels and provide additional financial information. She said the fault for the situation rests with Steward.",
