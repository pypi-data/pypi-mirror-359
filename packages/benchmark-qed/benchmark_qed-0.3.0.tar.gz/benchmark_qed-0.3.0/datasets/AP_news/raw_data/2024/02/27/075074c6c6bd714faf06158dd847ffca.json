But in an interview with The Associated Press, the producers say that while they were concerned about Williams' health and her behavior, they didn't realize she had dementia. Soon after they say they learned of her diagnosis in April 2023, they stopped filming. \u201cWhere is Wendy Williams?\", a two-part docuseries, aired Saturday and Sunday on Lifetime. Some criticized it for being exploitative, with scenes of Williams appearing unsteady, belligerent and drunk at times. The producers defend the show, saying what aired is honest and unfiltered, like Williams herself.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>If you watched Lifetime's <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/wendy-williams\">Wendy Williams</a> docuseries that premiered over the weekend and felt uncomfortable, you weren't alone.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Wendy Williams?\u201d premiered over the weekend and featured numerous scenes of the former talk show host unsteady, belligerent, confused and also drunk. Her manager would regularly find liquor bottles hidden throughout her apartment, behavior that producers say unnerved them while filming. But they say they didn't know at the time that Williams had dementia, which the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wendy-williams-dementia-diagnosis-d3cebb8c20f750a623f9d180a50c03e8\">public learned late last week</a>.</p><p>\u201cWe all became very concerned for her safety. To be honest, I was so concerned she would fall down the stairs and for numerous different reasons,\" said Erica Hanson, an executive producer who can be seen and heard speaking to Williams at certain moments in the series.</p><p>Hanson said soon after she and the filmmakers were told Williams had dementia by her son, they turned the cameras off.</p><p>\u201cWe decided to stop filming as a team. We kept hoping that she was going to get better but it became apparent to us that she was not and that she really needed help,\u201d Hanson said.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Wendy Williams?\u201d debuted Saturday, two days after her care team released a statement saying she has been diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wendy-williams-dementia-diagnosis-ftd-736b2a721d7b0a3e515e34c9cb997937\">frontotemporal dementia</a>, the same disease Bruce Willis has. Its two episodes aired after <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wendy-williams-documentary-court-fight-53ab1058f97c18b7a77fae307b7db356\">attorneys for Lifetime successfully fended off</a> an effort by Williams\u2019 guardian to stop the broadcasts.</p><p>In a review, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/reviews/where-is-wendy-williams-review-lifetime-1235920928/\">Variety called the series</a> \u201can exploitive display of her cognitive decline and emotional well-being.\u201d Danie Buchanan, a radio DJ in Atlanta posted a video reaction on Instagram saying, \u201cI couldn't finish it ... It was so hard to watch, it was so hard to see her like that,\u201d she said.</p><p>Throughout the documentary, Williams appears unsteady on her feet and she has trouble walking without assistance. Her emotions fluctuate between sweet to suddenly irritable to belligerent to weepy or frustrated. Many times the former talk show host admits to drinking. \u201cI love vodka,\u201d Williams, 59, says in the first episode.</p><p>She has been public about her cocaine addiction and lived in a \u201csober house\u201d in 2019. Each time someone brings up her drinking on camera, Williams ends the conversation.</p><p>In April 2023, the film crew followed Williams to Miami to visit her son Kevin, Jr. and other family. During the trip, Williams' son told the filmmakers that his mother suffers from a form of dementia caused by alcohol.</p><p>\"We didn\u2019t find out the diagnosis until Kevin Jr. shared that with us,\u201d said Brie Bryant, Lifetime's senior vice president of non-scripted programming.</p><p>After returning from Miami, the crew arrived at Williams' apartment to find her sobbing in her bed, seemingly inebriated. This was the tipping point \u2014 Hanson was filmed speaking with Williams\u2019 manager, Will Selby, about her condition, before they stopped filming Williams altogether. Shortly after she was placed in a treatment facility by her guardianship.</p><p>\u201cWe questioned all the time, \u2018Should we be here? Should we not? How can we tell this story sensitively?\u2019 It touched all of us deeply. It really did,\u201d Hanson said.</p><p>The project was intended to be a follow-up to Lifetime's 2021 \u201cWendy Williams: What a Mess!\" documentary and biopic \u201cWendy Williams: The Movie.\u201d Bryant said both the network and Williams enjoyed their partnership and agreed to film Williams' next chapter.</p><p>The objective, said Hanson, was to document a woman making changes in her life, facing obstacles, and coming out the other side. Williams' self-titled daytime <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-business-arts-and-entertainment-wendy-williams-sherri-shepherd-4490dfffe6ecf4ecbc5b35368375ef5e\">talk show ended in 2022</a> because of ongoing health issues with Graves' disease that kept her from filming. Sherri Shepherd, a guest host for Williams, was given her own show.</p><p>\u201cWe thought we were going to film a woman at a real turning point in her life, embarking on a new career with Wendy doing a podcast ... recovering from a very difficult divorce,\u201d said Hanson. \u201cOnce we started filming, it really went into a very different direction.\u201d</p><p>Producers say ultimately what was filmed and aired is honest and unfiltered, like Williams herself.</p><p>\u201cIt is a painful truth, and it\u2019s a very sad truth,\" added executive producer Mark Ford, \"but Wendy is one of the most radically honest storytellers in the history of media. Why would this documentary not echo that incredible legacy of of openness?\u201d</p><p>Bryant says there is \u201cno conversation\u201d about filming more with Williams in the future. \u201cThe only thing that we care about at Lifetime is that she had a platform to tell her story, and that we feel we did so responsibly, and that she gets well and hopefully gets to be with her family.\u201d</p><p>The filmmakers say they hope the series makes people take a closer look at guardianships. Because Williams' finances and medical care are managed by a third party, her family says they are unable to see her and have a say in her treatment.</p><p>\u201cWe hope that people can see why we aired it, and produced it, and that the intention is to shine a light on the difficulties and the secrecies in these guardianships,\" Ford said.</p>",
