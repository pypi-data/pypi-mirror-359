    "description_summary": "South Dakota's voters will be asked this fall to say whether the state can require certain people who receive Medicaid to work. The House of Representatives on Tuesday voted to put the question on the November ballot. Two years ago, voters approved a constitutional amendment expanding eligibility for the government health insurance program. The federal government would eventually have to sign off on a work requirement if it is approved by voters. Opponents say it's unnecessary, ineffective and against what voters approved in 2022. Supporters say other assistance programs have work requirements. They called the ballot measure a \u201cclarifying question\u201d for voters.",

The change, which took effect last summer, greatly increased the number of people in the state who qualify for Medicaid.</p><p>Even if voters approve the measure, the federal government will have to sign off on a work requirement.</p><p>The expansion was previously opposed by both Republican Gov. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-dakota-economy-kristi-noem-legislature-8024062c8db4a789f0e14f3d8c6554fe\">Kristi Noem</a> and the GOP-controlled Legislature, which defeated a proposed Medicaid expansion <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-business-senate-elections-legislature-elections-a61dc3fa706c5bacf9ae8eb041703860\">earlier in 2022.</a></p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-kristi-noem-legislature-south-dakota-1e434f22dc43b9187212f541f5f9babf\">The 2022 constitutional amendment</a> expanded Medicaid eligibility to people who earn up to 138% of the federal poverty level, which the state Department of Social Services says is up to $41,400 for a family of four.</p><p>Republican Rep. Tony Venhuizen, a prime sponsor of the work requirement measure, described it as a \u201cclarifying question\" for voters on a specific point.</p><p>\u201cWhen you listen to the opposition on this, you hear people who very clearly want people to go on Medicaid expansion and stay on it for a long period of time as their plan for health care, and I just don't think that's the purpose of social programs in South Dakota. We want to give people a hand up to a better life,\" Venhuizen said.</p><p>Details of and exemptions from the work requirement are \u201clike step 10,\" he told a House panel Monday during a hearing for the resolution. \u201cWhat we're talking about today is step one.\u201d</p><p>Supporters also have pointed out that other assistance programs, such as food benefits, have work requirements.</p><p>Opponents have said a work requirement would be unnecessary, ineffective and against the will of voters in 2022. South Dakota has a 2% unemployment rate, behind only Maryland and North Dakota, <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm\">according to</a> the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in January.</p><p>\u201cWho is not working? Who is on Medicaid and is not working? And I can answer that for you, it's the poorest of the poor,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Kadyn Wittman, who called the measure's consideration \u201cdeeply offensive to every individual that voted yes\u201d for Medicaid expansion in 2022.</p><p>The expanded eligibility took effect July 1, 2023. Nearly 20,000 people have since enrolled. More people are expected to enroll. <a href=\"https://dss.sd.gov/docs/economicassistance/expansion/Eligibility.pdf\">The department estimated</a> 52,000 new people would qualify for Medicaid expansion when it opened.</p>",
