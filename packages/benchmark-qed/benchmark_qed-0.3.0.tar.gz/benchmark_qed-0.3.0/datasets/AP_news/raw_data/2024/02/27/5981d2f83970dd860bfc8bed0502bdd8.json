Families of students with disabilities during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic brought the legal challenge. The ruling Tuesday marks the conclusion of the yearslong court battle that originated in the fall of 2021. The lawsuit alleges Reynolds violated federal disability law by preventing schools from adopting mask mandates as an accommodation for students with disabilities. The law had been partially blocked for schools with students with disabilities for most of the 2021-2022 school year.",

Kim Reynolds\u2019 policy prohibiting schools from instituting mask requirements, which was brought by families of students with disabilities during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The ruling marks the conclusion of the yearslong court battle, originating in the fall of 2021 with a lawsuit alleging that Reynolds violated federal disability law by preventing schools from adopting mask mandates as an accommodation for students with disabilities.</p><p>Reynolds celebrated the result, saying in a statement that Iowa focused on keeping kids in the classroom, \u201ctrusting parents to decide what was best for their children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile children were the least vulnerable, they paid the highest price for COVID lockdowns and mandates, but Iowa was a different story,\u201d she said.</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa and Disability Rights Iowa, among others, filed the lawsuit on behalf of The Arc of Iowa, a disability advocacy organization, and Iowa families, citing the heightened risk to students with disabilities.</p><p>Rita Bettis Austen, ACLU of Iowa\u2019s legal director, said in a statement they were disappointed by the ruling but \u201cproud of what this case was able to accomplish for vulnerable children in Iowa,\u201d saying the case provided \u201cearly relief for our clients.\u201d</p><p>The law was partially blocked for schools with students with disabilities for most of the 2021-2022 school year.</p><p>\u201cMasking was critical to protecting the ability of children with underlying conditions and disabilities to attend school in person,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cEven in dismissing the case, the Court confirmed that Iowa law \u2018does not prohibit a school from complying with disability laws.\u2019\u201d</p><p>A federal judge ruled in November 2022 that a school must consider, like any other accommodation request, a disabled students\u2019 request that teachers, aides, students or others interacting with them wear a mask. The judge also said that a mandate must be allowed if that school district, considering Reynolds\u2019 ban on mask mandates among other factors, determines it the request is a reasonable modification to make.</p><p>Reynolds appealed, and the federal court\u2019s ruling orders dismissal, saying those who brought the lawsuit didn't have standing to sue the state over the law. While COVID-19 remains an \u201cever-present concern in society,\u201d the court said, the general risks \u201care not enough to show \u2018imminent and substantial\u2019 harm for standing\u201d since they are speculative.</p><p>The court also dismissed the claims saying they did not clearly establish a connection between Reynolds\u2019 action \u2013 the law or its enforcement \u2013 and the alleged injury of enduring COVID-19 and its risks.</p>",

While the topic of mask mandates is related to health, the primary focus of the document is on the legal proceedings and implications of the court's decision rather than on health itself. The document does touch on health-related aspects, such as the impact on students with disabilities and the role of masks in protecting vulnerable children, but these points are secondary to the legal narrative."
