    "body_nitf": "<p>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) \u2014 West Virginia's Republican-majority Senate greenlit a bill on Tuesday that would make <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/baby-olivia-sex-education-fetal-development-42415141e15057bc91f34bc2d34e449e\">a video on fetal development</a> produced by an anti-abortion group required viewing in public schools.</p><p>Live Action\u2019s \u201cBaby Olivia\u201d video, which West Virginia lawmakers want to show in eighth and tenth-grade classrooms, has received criticism from physicians and educators who say it misleads viewers. It is already being used in some schools in North Dakota, though it wasn't specifically mandated in the law passed last year in that state. Similar bills have been proposed in Iowa, Kentucky and Missouri.</p><p>The bill now heads to the House of Delegates for consideration.</p><p>The animated video is meant to visualize development in the womb, depicting an egg being fertilized and implanted and progressing through embryonic and fetal developments occurring throughout a pregnancy. A voiceover introduces viewers to Olivia as an illustration of a fully developed baby in utero appears on screen. Olivia\u2019s mouth and eyes open and close, and her hands move.</p><p>The video refers to a \u201cheartbeat\" at six weeks. At that point, the embryo isn\u2019t yet a fetus and doesn\u2019t have a heart. It also describes the animated figure\u2019s motion and actions with words like \u201cplaying,\u201d \u201cexploring,\u201d \u201csighing,\u201d and making \u201cspeaking movements\" \u2014 language critics have said assign human traits and properties to a fetus that are more sophisticated than medicine can prove.</p><p>Speaking during his chamber's floor Tuesday, Republican Senate Majority Leader Tom Takubo said he couldn\u2019t support the bill because it contains \u201cgrossly inaccurate\u201d information contradictory to science. A working pulmonologist, he had pushed for a change to the bill that would have required any video shown in school to be scientifically accurate. That effort failed.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to codify something that we\u2019re going to teach, \u2018this is fact,\u2019 it needs to be fact,\u201d he said.</p><p>Republican Sen. Amy Grady, the chamber's education chair and a public school teacher, said the legislation is not \u201canti-abortion.\" Grady, who voted for the state's near-total abortion ban that passed in 2022, said all of her students have different learning styles: some like reading textbooks, some are more tactile learners, others visual learners.</p><p>\u201cThose photos in a textbook help some students, but not all of them,\u201d she said. \u201cThis computer-generated image or this computer-generated video, an animated video, puts it in terms that kids can understand and it lets them see it, and lets them see the growth happen.\"</p><p>Republican Patricia Rucker said the video \u201cis not political and it is not religious: It is a springboard for conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does not replace the resources teachers are using right now, currently, in the state of West Virginia \u2014 it\u2019s not asking them to throw a single one of those resources out,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is one short video shown twice in our schools to help make the subject more approachable.\u201d</p><p>Democratic Sen. Mike Woelfel said, however, that he fears it runs afoul of the First Amendment right to religious freedom. His personal belief, like Grady's, is that life begins at conception, but not everyone agrees, he said.</p><p>He mentioned Jewish students, citing a belief in that faith that life begins at birth. The same argument has been used to challenge abortion bans across the country in court.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any problem with the video \u2014 I would gladly show that video in the Catholic school that my grandchildren attend,\" he said. \"But I\u2019ve taken an oath to obey the Constitution and to uphold it, and for that reason, I would urge a no vote.\u201d</p><p>The \u201cBaby Olivia\u201d bill also contains a provision added after its introduction that requires the teaching of the Holocaust and a reading of The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank in tenth or eleventh grade.</p><p>Live Action says on its website it \u201cexists today to shift public opinion\u201d on abortion and is dedicated to supporting a \u201cculture of life.\u201d</p><p>The organization spent nearly $5 million in 2022 to create and distribute content widely, according to filing reports. Those reports also show Live Action more than quadrupled its cash from contributions and grants in just four years, totaling $14 million in 2022.</p><p>Live Action also is known for efforts to expose Planned Parenthood, publishing videos and reports obtained by posing as patients.</p><p>Founder Lila Rose told The Associated Press the video was made in consultation with doctors and was designed to be informative, lifelike and appropriate for anyone. It calls out general markers in what Rose said is an \u201caverage developmental process\u201d using \u201cweeks after fertilization.\u201d That\u2019s different from \u201cweeks after the last menstrual cycle,\u201d which is what a pregnant person would typically hear from a doctor.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Associated Press reporter Hannah Fingerhut contributed to this report from Des Moines, Iowa.</p>",

While the topic touches on health-related issues such as fetal development and the accuracy of medical information, the primary focus is on the legislative process, political opinions, and educational policies. The document also delves into the controversy surrounding the video's content and its implications for religious freedom and educational standards. Therefore, while there are health-related elements, the document is not primarily focused on health as a topic."
