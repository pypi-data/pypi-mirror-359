Adeline Hambley's lengthy legal fight with county commissioners over pandemic-era mask mandates concluded Tuesday with the board bowing to the will of a court-ordered arbitrator. The Ottawa County Board of Commissioners voted 11-0 Monday to retain Hambley as county health officer. It's part of a settlement to end her lawsuit against the board. The commissioners first tried to fire Hambley in January 2023. But when they were unable to, they offered her a $4 million settlement in return for her resignation, then rescinded the offer.",

It included a section stating that if the board tries to fire Hambley again before January 2025, the board would not have the power to do so.</p><p>\u201cIt was absolutely a priority,\u201d said Sarah Howard, Hambley\u2019s attorney. \u201cThere\u2019s no predicting what\u2019s going to happen in the future. ...

Officials who usually worked behind the scenes managing immunizations and water quality inspections found themselves center stage during the COVID-19 pandemic, as elected officials and members of the public who were frustrated with lockdowns and safety restrictions turned public health workers into <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/96cd6aff79638dc382296ae4521f4afe\">politicized punching bags</a>.</p>",
