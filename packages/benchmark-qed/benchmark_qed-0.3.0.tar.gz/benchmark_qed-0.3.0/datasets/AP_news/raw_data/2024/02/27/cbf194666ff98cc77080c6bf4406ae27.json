    "description_summary": "The first lawsuit brought amid reports that a nurse at a southern Oregon hospital replaced intravenous fentanyl drips with tap water seeks up to $11.5 million on behalf of the estate of a 65-year-old man who died. The wrongful death suit was filed Monday against Asante Rogue Regional Medical Center in Medford. It also names the nurse as a defendant. Last month, Medford police disclosed that they were investigating potential crimes against patients involving the theft of \u201ccontrolled substances,\u201d which may have led to \u201cadverse\u201d outcomes for some. Asante did not immediately return an email seeking comment about the lawsuit, but said in a statement last month it is cooperating with police.",

(AP) \u2014 The first lawsuit brought amid reports that a nurse at a southern Oregon hospital replaced intravenous fentanyl drips with tap water seeks up to $11.5 million on behalf of the estate of a 65-year-old man who died.</p><p>The wrongful death suit was filed Monday against Asante Rogue Regional Medical Center in Medford, <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2024/02/medford-hospital-nurse-replaced-fentanyl-with-tap-water-killing-patient-115-million-suit-alleges.html\">The Oregonian/OregonLive reported</a>. It also names nurse Dani Marie Schofield as a defendant.</p><p>Last month, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fentanyl-hospital-tampering-medication-6c0067cbd3ee1ab3dec2017fadb2946b\">Medford police disclosed</a> that they were investigating potential crimes against patients involving the theft of \u201ccontrolled substances,\u201d which may have led to \u201cadverse\u201d outcomes for some.</p><p>Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid that has helped fuel the nation's overdose epidemic, but it is also used in legitimate medical settings to relieve severe pain. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/politics-health-keene-new-hampshire-business-26c6bb0b914390d20bf49503367353db\">Drug theft from hospitals</a> is a longstanding problem.</p><p>Police declined to provide more information. Schofield agreed to a voluntary nursing license suspension last November \u201cpending the completion of an investigation,\u201d according to Oregon Board of Nursing records. No charges have been filed.</p><p>Justin Idiart, a southern Oregon lawyer, told The Oregonian/OregonLive that he represents nine clients whose medication was swapped out, and five others have reached out for possible representation. They include the loved ones of patients who died as well as some who survived. All of his clients were treated by Schofield, he said.</p><p>Other local law firms also have been exploring litigation. Attorneys say they expect as many as three dozen cases could be filed.</p><p>The hospital did not immediately return an email from The Associated Press seeking comment Tuesday. The AP could not immediately locate contact information for Schofield, and it was not clear if Schofield is represented by an attorney.</p><p>\u201cWe were distressed to learn of this issue,\u201d Asante said in a statement last month. \u201cWe reported it to law enforcement and are working closely with them.\u201d</p><p>Idiart filed the lawsuit in Jackson County Circuit Court over the death of Horace E. Wilson, who died in February 2022. Wilson, the founder of a cannabis company called Decibel Farms in Jacksonville, Oregon, was treated at the hospital after he fell off a ladder. He suffered bleeding from his spleen and had it removed.</p><p>But doctors then noted \u201cunexplained high fevers, very high white blood cell counts, and a precipitous decline,\u201d the complaint said. Tests confirmed an infection of treatment-resistant bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis. Wilson progressed to multi-system organ failure and died weeks later.</p><p>Idiart said patients who were deprived of medication suffered as a result of the medication diversion. In Wilson\u2019s case, his family believed he was in pain even though he was supposed to be sedated, Idiart said.</p><p>Asante last December contacted Medford police regarding a former employee \u201cthat they believe was involved in the theft of fentanyl prescribed to patients resulting in some adverse patient outcomes,\u201d the complaint said.</p><p>That month, hospital representatives \u201cbegan contacting patients and their relatives telling them a nurse had replaced fentanyl with tap water causing bacterial infections,\u201d it said.</p>",
