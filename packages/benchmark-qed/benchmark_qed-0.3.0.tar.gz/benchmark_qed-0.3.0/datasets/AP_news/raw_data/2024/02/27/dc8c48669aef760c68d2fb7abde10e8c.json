    "description_summary": "Efforts in Republican-led states to write definitions of male and female into law are leading to outcry that the measures deny transgender people legal recognition. At least 13 states have proposed bills this year that seek to narrowly define sex or gender as binary. The bills are part of a pushback from conservatives who say the state has a legitimate interest in the issue. But advocacy groups say the proposals are effectively erasing transgender people's rights and creating uncertainty for the larger population of intersex people. Before this year, there were four states with narrow definitions of the terms in their laws.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Mack Allen, an 18-year-old high school senior from Kansas, braces for sideways glances, questioning looks and snide comments whenever he has to hand over his driver's license, which still identifies him as female.</p><p>They've come from a police officer responding to a car accident. They've come from an urgent care employee loudly using the wrong name and pronouns. They've come from the people in the waiting room who overheard.</p><p>\u201cIt just feels gross because I\u2019ve worked so hard to get to where I am now in my transition, and obviously I don\u2019t look like a woman and I don\u2019t sound like a woman,\u201d said Allen, who has been on testosterone for two years.</p><p>Kansas enacted a law last year that ended legal recognition of transgender identities. The measure says there are only two sexes, male and female, that are based on a person\u2019s \u201cbiological reproductive system\" at birth.</p><p>That law and others introduced around the nation this year \u2014 often labeled as \"bills of rights\" for women \u2014 are part of a push by conservatives who say states have a legitimate interest in restricting transgender people from <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/title-ix-transgender-athletes-rights-9adfe49a8e07f66f07b5e2302bb94730\">competing on sports teams</a> or using bathrooms that align with their gender identity.</p><p>Critics argue the proposals to legally define sex as binary are essentially erasing transgender and nonbinary people\u2019s existences by making it as difficult as possible for them to update documents, use facilities and generally participate authentically in public life.</p><p>They\u2019re also creating uncertainty for the many intersex people \u2014 those born with physical traits that don\u2019t fit typical definitions of male or female \u2014 with the measures unclear on how people would prove they\u2019re exempt.</p><p>Some of the measures would remove the word gender, which refers to social and self-identity, from state code and replace it with sex, which refers to biological traits, conflating the two terms. Others make gender a synonym for sex. <a href=\"https://policysearch.ama-assn.org/policyfinder/detail/gender%20identity?uri=%2FAMADoc%2Fdirectives.xml-D-295.312.xml\">Medical experts</a> say the efforts rely on an outdated idea of gender by defining it as binary rather than a spectrum.</p><p>\u201cYou pass a law because there's a problem. The medical community doesn't see people having different gender identities or being born with an intersex condition as a problem for society,\" said Dr. Jack Drescher, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University who edited the section about gender dysphoria in the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s diagnostic manual. \u201cThe medical community can only stand back to say, what exactly are you passing this law to protect?\u201d</p><p>Measures have been proposed this year in at least 13 states \u2014 Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming \u2014 and advocates expect that number to grow. The bills follow a historic push for restrictions on transgender people, especially youths, by Republican lawmakers last year. At least 23 states have banned gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, and some states are now shifting their focus to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ohio-transgender-genderaffirming-regulations-adults-dewine-179092da5e1bf7c23f7141832e39d87d\">trying to restrict that care for adults</a>, as well. Others have moved on restroom and sports restrictions.</p><p>Many political observers say the Republican focus on transgender people is an attempt to rally a voting base with a \u201cwedge issue\" to replace abortion rights, which the public has largely favored, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-primary-elections-kansas-abortion-b6d62a852c2ce4617f2c03589fbb523e\">notably in Kansas</a>. The efforts also worry transgender people and their allies that they're further stigmatizing and threatening a community already at high risk of stress, depression and suicidal behavior.</p><p>With the latest round of bills defining man and woman, it's clear \u201cthe intent is to make it as difficult as possible for transgender people to operate within a state,\" said Sarah Warbelow, legal vice president of the Human Rights Campaign, a large LGBTQ+ rights group.</p><p>\u201cIt's an attempt to deny transgender people's existence,\u201d she said.</p><p>A similar proposal in Iowa put forward by Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds led to protests at the state Capitol. The bill was introduced soon after the failure of a lawmaker\u2019s effort to remove gender identity from the state\u2019s civil right law. It would narrowly define male and female and require a transgender person\u2019s assigned sex at birth to be listed alongside their gender identity on their birth certificate.</p><p>\u201cWomen and men are not identical; they possess unique biological differences,\" Reynolds said after introducing the measure. \"That\u2019s not controversial, it\u2019s common sense.\u201d</p><p>The sponsor of a similar bill passed by the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/west-virginia-womens-rights-bill-f12cdbbb21b55f9bd10c6ac75e68a366\">West Virginia House</a> said the legislation is needed to allow restrictions on who can use single-sex restrooms, locker rooms and changing areas.</p><p>\u201cAt any given time, we're unable to protect single-sex spaces,\u201d said Del. Kathie Hess Crouse, the measure's sponsor, said. \u201cIf we don't have a definition, we can't protect them.\u201d</p><p>Jocelyn Krueger, of Grinnell, Iowa, joined protesters at the statehouse days after testifying to lawmakers that she opposed the failed effort to remove gender identity from the civil rights law.</p><p>Krueger said she\u2019s concerned about potential repercussions of the bill, given that a person\u2019s identifying documents \u201cunlock basic participation\u201d in everyday life.</p><p>She compared it to how she was temporarily unable to get money from her bank account when she was updating her documents. Krueger worries the Iowa bill could create similar challenges for trans residents, but longer term.</p><p>\u201cNot having access to documentation, or things that out you in a way, or where your documentation doesn't match, puts you at risk for all of those daily interactions where people are looking at your documentation,\u201d Krueger said.</p><p>The Williams Institute, a think tank at UCLA Law, estimates there are 1.3 million transgender adults in the U.S. But <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/how-many-transgender-intersex-laws-0218b75a197f07d8c51620bb73495d55\">it's believed that intersex people</a> represent 1.7% of humans, which would translate to over 5 million in the U.S. alone.</p><p>In Alabama, lawmakers added language to legislation defining male and female that sex can be designated as unknown on state records \u201cwhen sex cannot be medically determined for developmental or other reasons.\u201d</p><p>West Virginia's proposal specifically states that someone who is intersex is \u201cnot considered a third sex.\u201d But the measure says people with a \"medically verifiable\u201d diagnosis of it should be accommodated.</p><p>Before this year, Kansas and Montana, North Dakota and Tennessee had enacted laws defining man and woman in state code. Oklahoma \u2014 where advocates say a law restricting bathroom access helped create a climate that led to the bullying of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nonbinary-student-death-nex-owasso-oklahoma-vigils-fd7695afb780d09c00b823fa0618e79f\">nonbinary teenager Nex Benedict</a>, who died after a fight in a girls bathroom at a school \u2014 already has a measure by executive order, as does Nebraska.</p><p>Before Tennessee's law took effect, advocates held events to assist people on changing their names and gender identities on government documents.</p><p>\u201cThere's a lot of potential for harm that seems ready to explode at any moment,\u201d said Dahron Johnson, of the Tennessee Equality Project.</p><p>In South Carolina, amendments have been proposed to the state constitution to narrowly define male and female. But the measures face an uphill battle in clearing the Legislature by an April 10 deadline in order to make this fall's ballot.</p><p>Opponents say efforts to codify sex are likely to face court challenges, just as other restrictions such as youth medical care have.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already lost this case,\u201d said Idaho Rep. Ilana Rubel, a Democrat who voted against a definition bill approved by the state's Republican-led House, predicting the state would get sued. \u201cThis is really just an unfortunate gesture that makes people in our community feel unwanted and unloved by their government.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>DeMillo reported from Little Rock, Arkansas.

            "reason": "The document primarily discusses legislative measures in various states aimed at defining sex as binary and the impact of these measures on transgender and intersex individuals. While it touches on the mental health implications for the transgender community, such as stress, depression, and suicidal behavior, the main focus is on legal and social issues rather than health. Therefore, it is somewhat relevant to health but not primarily focused on it."
