PFAS chemicals have been linked to health problems, including liver dysfunction and certain cancers. Many fast-food manufacturers, such as McDonald's, halted use of the wrappers before the phase-out date. Drinking water is another major source of PFAS chemicals entering the body.",

Consumers concerned about PFAS levels can look at maps maintained by the Environmental Protection Agency to see if their water is affected and obtain filters to remove the chemicals.</p><p>PFAS also accumulates in meat and dairy, she said, and advises people to cut back on those foods. She also recommended avoiding certain indoor cleaning solvents or products treated with water-resistant chemicals, as well as removing shoes indoors to keep from tracking PFAS into the house and washing your hands before eating or preparing food.</p><p>\u201cNone of us can avoid it,\u201d she said.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
