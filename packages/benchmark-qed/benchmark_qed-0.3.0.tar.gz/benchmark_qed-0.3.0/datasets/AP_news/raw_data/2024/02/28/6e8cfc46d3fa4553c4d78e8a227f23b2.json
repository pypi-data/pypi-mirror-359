The measure was promised by President Emmanuel Macron following a rollback of abortion rights in court rulings in the United States. Wednesday\u2019s vote came after the lower house, the National Assembly, overwhelmingly approved the proposal in January. The measure now goes before a joint session of parliament for its expected approval by a three-fifths majority. Macron\u2019s government wants Article 34 of the constitution amended to specify that \u201cthe law determines the conditions by which is exercised the freedom of women to have recourse to an abortion, which is guaranteed.\u201d",

While the primary focus is on legislative and political processes, the topic of abortion is inherently related to health, particularly women's reproductive health. The document also touches on the broader context of abortion rights in other countries, which is relevant to global health discussions. However, the document is more focused on the legal and political aspects rather than the health implications directly."
