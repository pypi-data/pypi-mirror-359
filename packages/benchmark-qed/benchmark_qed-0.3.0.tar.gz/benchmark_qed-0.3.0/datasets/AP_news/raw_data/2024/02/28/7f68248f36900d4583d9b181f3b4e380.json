The objection was to a bill by Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who used IVF treatments to have her two children after struggling with years of infertility. Duckworth\u2019s bill would establish a federal right to the treatments as the Alabama ruling has upended fertility care in the state and families who had already started the process face heartbreak and uncertainty.",

Cindy Hyde-Smith, a Mississippi Republican, objected to a request for a vote by Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who used <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/in-vitro-fertilization\">IVF treatments</a> to have her two children after struggling with years of infertility. Duckworth\u2019s bill would establish a federal right to the treatments as the Alabama ruling has upended fertility care in the state and families who had already started the process <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alabama-iv-vitro-lawmakers-d1db05b0adb632240a91e1fcfe229b13\">face heartbreak and uncertainty</a>.</p><p>Several clinics in the state announced they were pausing IVF services as they sort out last week\u2019s ruling, which said that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. The court said that three Alabama couples who lost frozen embryos during an accident at a storage facility could sue the fertility clinic and hospital for the wrongful death of a minor child.</p><p>Democrats have immediately seized on the election-year ruling, warning that other states could follow Alabama\u2019s lead and that other rights could be threatened as well in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade and the federal right to an abortion in 2022. Congress passed similar legislation in 2022 that would protect the federal right to same-sex and interracial marriages.</p><p>\u201cMark my words, if we don\u2019t act now, it will only get worse,\u201d Duckworth said.</p><p>Abortion opponents have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/embryos-ivf-abortion-personhood-laws-ffe4f4d326469a97fef999254ca86eea\">pushed laws in at least 15 states</a> based on the idea that a fetus should have the same rights as a person.</p><p>Hyde-Smith defended the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alabama-supreme-court-from-embryos-161390f0758b04a7638e2ddea20df7ca\">Alabama Supreme Court decision</a> that found frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Republicans widely hold the stance that the federal government should not interfere with state-level decisions on reproductive care after the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-dobbs-roe-anniversary-rally-ff6196c80112b7c9d5e6822b1807bf3e\">Dobbs v. Jackson Supreme Court decision</a> in 2022 left decisions on abortion restrictions up to states.</p><p>\u201cI support the ability for mothers and fathers to have total access to IVF and bringing new life into the world. I also believe human life should be protected,\u201d Hyde-Smith said.</p><p>At the same time, Alabama lawmakers are scrambling to find ways to protect the treatments. And former President <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</a>, the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination, said he would \u201cstrongly support the availability of IVF.\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-ivf-abortion-alabama-republicans-8215336740a5963b57bbd970b47bb3a7\">called on lawmakers in Alabama</a> to preserve access to the treatment.</p><p>Many GOP lawmakers also reinforced their support for IVF services.</p><p>Soon after the decision, Alabama Sen. Katie Britt made calls to fellow Republicans, including Trump, to argue for the importance of supporting the treatments, emphasizing that they are pro-life and pro-family, according to a person familiar with the calls.</p><p>In a statement after the ruling, Britt said that \u201cdefending life and ensuring continued access to IVF services for loving parents are not mutually exclusive.\u201d</p><p>Other Republicans agreed. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, one of the more vocal opponents of abortion in the Senate, said he supports IVF and believes it is \u201centirely life affirming.\u201d Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall, a former obstetrician, said he\u2019d referred patients for IVF treatments for 25 years in his practice. \u201cWe are the pro-family party, and there\u2019s nothing more pro-family than helping couples have a baby,\" Marshall said.</p><p>Still, this is the second time Republicans have blocked Duckworth\u2019s bill. By Bringing it up again, Democrats said they are challenging GOP senators to display real support for IVF access after many this week issued statements criticizing the Alabama ruling. Democrats held the Senate floor for 45 minutes Wednesday with a series of speeches deriding the overturn of Roe v. Wade.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday that Republicans who have denounced the Alabama ruling \u201care like the arsonist who set a house on fire and say, why is it burning?\"</p><p>For Duckworth, the bill holds deep personal significance.
