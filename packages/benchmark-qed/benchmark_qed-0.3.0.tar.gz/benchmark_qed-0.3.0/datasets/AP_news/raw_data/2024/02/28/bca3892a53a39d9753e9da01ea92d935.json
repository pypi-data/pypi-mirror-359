The proposal, which now heads to the Senate, was greenlit after more than 500 medical professionals and students signed a letter opposing it, expressing concern it would cause young patients preventable harm and put their lives at risk. House Republicans say such fears are overblown and that the bill is less restrictive than current law.

    "body_nitf": "<p>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) \u2014 West Virginia's Republican-controlled House of Delegates passed a bill on Wednesday that doctors treating transgender youth in the state say would prevent the prescription of certain medical interventions like hormone therapy to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/west-virginia-affirming-care-transgender-suicide-60162f6e6e6e32d13e8dc6f75bc5ed25\">patients at risk for self-harm or suicide</a>.</p><p>The proposal, which now heads to the Senate, was greenlit after more than 500 medical professionals and students <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/west-virginia-gender-affirming-care-29437bf24673dfb6e79f9af255c642bf\">signed a letter opposing it</a>, expressing concern it would cause young patients preventable harm and put their lives at risk.</p><p>House Republicans said such fears are overblown and that the bill is less restrictive than current law. But the state's only LGBTQ+ advocacy organization and doctors treating transgender youth in West Virginia said that's not true.</p><p>\u201cIf this bill becomes law, it will take away the only treatment that has been shown to help a small, but very vulnerable group of children,\u201d said Dr. Kate Waldeck, a pediatric critical care physician at Hoops Family Children\u2019s Hospital in the state\u2019s second-largest city of Huntington. Waldeck runs a monthly clinic for transgender youth \u2014 one of only a few existing care options in the state.</p><p>She said the law as it stands enables transgender adolescents to get the medical and psychiatric evaluations they need while still allowing doctors \u201cto provide what is truly life-saving medical care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it comes down to \u2014 gender-affirming care keeps these children out of my PICU. It saves lives,\u201d she said. \"And the new bill would strip parents of the right to obtain this potentially life-saving care for their children.\u201d</p><p>On the House floor, Lead Sponsor Republican Del. Geoff Foster said he doesn't believe treatments like puberty blockers help reduce suicide rates, despite research showing otherwise.</p><p>He said the bill is \u201cpointing doctors in the direction of actually treating the issue of the suicidality problem and the depression rather than moving to a solution that\u2019s not working.\u201d</p><p>Republicans in the House of Delegates \u2014 who occupy 89 out of 100 seats \u2014 voted last year to eliminate transgender minors' access to hormone therapy and puberty blockers. The bill was altered in the Senate by Majority Leader Tom Takubo, a physician who expressed concern about the high suicide rate for transgender youth.</p><p>The 2023 law allows the prescription of medical interventions but requires parental consent and a diagnosis of severe gender dysphoria from two medical professionals, both of whom must provide written testimony that medical interventions are necessary to prevent or limit possible or actual self-harm.</p><p>It says any use of the medication must be the lowest possible necessary \"to treat the psychiatric condition and not for purposes of gender transition.\u201d</p><p>Takubo, a physician, cited more than a dozen peer-reviewed studies showing a decrease in rates of suicide ideation and attempts among youth with severe gender dysphoria who had access to medication therapy. Gender dysphoria is defined by medical professionals as severe psychological distress experienced by those whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth.</p><p>The law also prohibits kids from accessing gender-affirming surgery, which physicians said wasn\u2019t happening in West Virginia anyway.</p><p>House Health and Human Resources Chair Amy Summers, a Republican and registered nurse, said this year's bill wouldn't prevent adolescents from getting hormone therapy treatment for psychiatric conditions like gender dysphoria as long as the dose was not supraphysiologic, or high enough that it \u201cactually assisted that child in transitioning.\"</p><p>\u201cWhat has been expressed to me by physicians is that they are receiving lower doses of a hormone, and that tends to help with their anxiety and depression,\u201d she said. \"But it\u2019s not doses that transition that individual.\u201d</p><p>Republican Del. JB Akers said he's received emails from \u201cpeople who I think simply attacked this body for going after kids and going after doctors,\" and that people upset about the bill don't fully understand it. Current law already prevents prescribing medication to assist minors with a gender transition, he said: \u201dWhether you like it or not \u2014 that\u2019s what the law is.\"</p><p>\u201cWe have affirmation that this medication can still be provided for psychiatric treatment, which is my main concern. And that\u2019s not changed,\" he said. \u201cAnd no one in this body is against the physicians or health care providers who provide this care.\u201d</p><p>But Waldeck, the doctor who treats transgender kids in West Virginia, said in a phone interview Wednesday that it doesn\u2019t feel that way to her.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re saying you can\u2019t do it for gender transition, well, what is the normal physiologic level, then?\u201d she said. \u201cIn terms of what doctors are legally going to be able to do, in reality, there\u2019s not going to be a normal quote unquote physiologic level for a biological female who is getting testosterone for their gender dysphoria and suicidality.\u201d</p><p>She said if signed into law, the proposal would restrict her ability to help her most at-risk patients: \"In reality, it is still an effective treatment ban.\"</p><p>Before voting for the bill, lawmakers rejected two amendments from Democratic Del. Mike Pushkin. One would have allowed kids already receiving treatment to continue care. The other would have allowed treatment if an attending physician provides a written opinion that it's \"medically necessary to treat the minor\u2019s psychiatric symptoms that makes the minor a danger to commit suicide without such treatment.\u201d</p><p>Every major medical organization, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association, supports gender-affirming care for youths.</p><p>Lawmakers in West Virginia and other states advancing <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/arkansas-state-government-south-dakota-tennessee-utah-mississippi-bb6bc7f6e7d5d733c081b2b87e958171\">bans on transgender health care</a> for youth and young adults often characterize gender-affirming treatments as <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/arkansas-state-government-south-dakota-tennessee-utah-mississippi-bb6bc7f6e7d5d733c081b2b87e958171\">medically unproven, potentially dangerous</a> and a symptom of \u201cwoke\u201d culture.</p><p>Andrew Schneider, Executive Director of Fairness West Virginia, said delegates are sending a message to parents with transgender teens who are at serious risk of self-harm or suicide that they can\u2019t get their kid the help that doctors say they need in West Virginia.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how anyone could look at these families and tell them their child\u2019s life doesn\u2019t matter, but that\u2019s what they did today with this vote,\u201d he said.</p>",
