In recent weeks he has walked the short distance to his chair, but he has been struggling with mild flu symptoms the past week.</p><p>The pope also canceled appointments Saturday and Monday due to the flu, but appeared as usual for the Sunday blessing from a window overlooking St. Peter's Square.</p><p>Last week, Francis coughed repeatedly as he presided over Ash Wednesday services at a Roman church, and opted not to participate in the traditional procession that inaugurates the church\u2019s Lenten season.</p><p>This time of year in 2020, just as the coronavirus pandemic was starting to hit Italy, Francis also suffered a bad cold that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-ap-top-news-international-news-pope-francis-europe-c857823e5212f4da2bf6ed3b451ba3c2\">forced him to cancel</a> several days of official audiences and his participation in the Vatican\u2019s annual spiritual retreat. The Vatican had already scrubbed the retreat for this year in favor of personal spiritual exercises</p><p>The Argentine pope had part of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pope-hospital-health-intestine-64750f0392511ea6dc6824b8f8db4f5a\">one lung removed</a> as a young man because of a respiratory infection, and in 2021 had a chunk of his colon removed because of an intestinal inflammation. He has been using a wheelchair and cane since last year because of strained knee ligaments and a small knee fracture that have made walking and standing difficult.</p><p>The Pope used his brief words at the end of Wednesday's audience to mark the 25th anniversary of the ratification of the Anti-Personnel Mines Convention, expressing his \u201ccloseness to the numerous victims of these insidious devices that remind us of the dramatic cruelty of war.\u201d</p><p>He also appealed for peace in the Middle East, Ukraine and prayed for the victims of attacks in Burkina Faso and Haiti.</p><p>At the end of the audience, the pope spent about an hour greeting the faithful from his wheelchair, stopping to talk, bless babies and exchange gifts.</p>",
