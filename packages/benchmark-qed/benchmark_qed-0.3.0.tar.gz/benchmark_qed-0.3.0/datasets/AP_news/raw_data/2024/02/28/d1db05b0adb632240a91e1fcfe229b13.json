Those gathered at the Statehouse Wednesday included patients and doctors alike. Three IVF providers in Alabama paused services after the state Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos were considered \u201cextrauterine children\u201d under the state wrongful death law. Alabama lawmakers have proposed separate proposals that would give lawsuit protections to clinics or state that a human embryo outside of a uterus \u201cis not considered an unborn child.\u201d",

    "body_nitf": "<p>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) \u2014 LeeLee Ray went through eight miscarriages, one ectopic pregnancy and multiple surgeries before turning to surrogacy in her hopes of having a child.</p><p>She and her husband found a surrogate through a matching program, and they hoped to soon transfer frozen embryos. But now that plan is in doubt <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alabama-frozen-embryos-pause-4cf5d3139e1a6cbc62bc5ad9946cc1b8\">as Alabama fertility clinics paused IVF services</a> in the wake of a state court ruling that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alabama-supreme-court-from-embryos-161390f0758b04a7638e2ddea20df7ca\">embryos are considered children</a> under the state's wrongful death law.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just frustrated. We had a light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Ray said. She said they can\u2019t transfer their frozen embryos to their surrogate and can\u2019t move the embryos out of state. Ray was one of more than 200 IVF patients who descended on the Alabama Statehouse Wednesday to urge lawmakers to find a way to restore IVF treatment in the state.</p><p>Republican lawmakers promised swift action and advanced proposals to provide criminal and civil lawsuit protections to in vitro fertilization service providers. But GOP lawmakers \u2014 navigating both a backlash over the IVF decision and hardline abortion opponents in their own party \u2014 steered clear of trying to define whether the embryos should be considered human life.</p><p>\u201cWe're trying to find a solution ... It should get the clinics back open,\u201d Republican Sen. Tim Melson, a doctor and sponsor of one of the bills, said of the immunity proposal.</p><p>Alabama justices this month said three couples who had frozen embryos destroyed in an accident at a storage facility could pursue wrongful death lawsuits for their \u201cextrauterine children.\u201d In reaching the decision, Alabama justices cited anti-abortion language added to the Alabama Constitution in 2018, saying the state recognizes and protects the \u201crights of unborn children.\u201d The constitutional amendment was approved by 59% of Alabama voters.</p><p>The ruling, treating an embryo the same as a child or gestating fetus under the wrongful death statute, raised concerns about civil liabilities for clinics. Three clinics announced a pause on IVF services.</p><p>Melson shelved an earlier proposal that said an embryo should not be considered a human life until implanted in the uterus.</p><p>\u201cThere's a lot of different opinions on what's alive, what's viable, what's not,\u201d Melson said Wednesday.</p><p>Some conservative groups had expressed concern about proposals that would exclude embryos from the definition of human life. Eagle Forum of Alabama issued a statement urging lawmakers to avoid \"legislation that may be in direct violation of our Constitution as well as the clear definition of human life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife begins at conception, not implantation,\u201d Eagle Forum stated. The group urged lawmakers to find a way to let IVF treatments proceed, but also supported prohibitions around the destruction or donation of viable embryos.</p><p>Some lawmakers questioned the need to pause IVF. Republican Sen. Larry Stutts, an obstetrician who is also sponsoring one of the proposals, noted that some clinics \u201cnever closed.\u201d</p><p>A Democratic senator said Wednesday that Republicans are not \"dealing with the issues that got us here.\" Some House Democrats have proposed legislation to state that a human embryo outside of a uterus \u201cis not considered an unborn child or human being for any purpose under state law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless we redefine this as to whether an embryo is a child \u2014 and if we don\u2019t deal with the elephant in the room that got us to this place \u2014 we\u2019re going to be back here,\u201d Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison, a Democrat from Birmingham, said.</p><p>Rep. Chris England, a Democrat from Tuscaloosa, said lawmakers may be able to provide a \u201ctemporary solution\u201d through legislation, but that a long-term solution must address the 2018 constitutional amendment.</p><p>\u201cThat amendment is essentially a personhood amendment,\u201d England said. \u201cIt's interesting that everybody keeps saying the decision was wrong, but the legislation doesn't address the decision.\u201d</p><p>Advocates are concerned that IVF will become <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/embryos-ivf-abortion-personhood-laws-ffe4f4d326469a97fef999254ca86eea\">increasingly entangled in the debate</a> over abortion.</p><p>Barbara Collura, President of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, said the nation is watching to see what happens in Alabama.</p><p>\u201cThis could potentially be a roadmap for other states to restrict IVF or a roadmap on how to protect IVF and family building,\" Collura said.</p><p>Dr. Michael C. Allemand, said the past 10 days had been the \u201chardest of my career\" as he had tear-filled conversations with patients that \u201cwe might have to interrupt their journey.\"</p><p>\u201cEveryone is crying. They're crying. I'm crying,\u201d Allemand said. \u201cI never anticipated that we wouldn\u2019t be able to provide standard fertility care to our patients.\u201d</p>",
