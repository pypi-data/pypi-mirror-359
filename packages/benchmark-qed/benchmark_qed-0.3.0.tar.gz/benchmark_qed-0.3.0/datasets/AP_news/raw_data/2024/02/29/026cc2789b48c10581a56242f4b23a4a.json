    "description_summary": "A small nicotine pouch called Zyn has sparked a big debate among politicians, pundits and experts. The dispute reflects an increasingly complex marketplace in which companies like Philip Morris International are promoting alternative products that may be less harmful than cigarettes and chewing tobacco. But health advocates fear Zyn, like electronic cigarettes, may catch on with teenagers due to its addictive nicotine. A recent warning about Zyn by a top Democratic senator prompted a swift backlash from Republicans and conservative pundits. Meanwhile, videos of young people popping the pouches have racked up millions of views on TikTok and other social media platforms.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 There\u2019s nothing complicated about the latest tobacco product trending online: Zyn is a tiny pouch filled with nicotine and flavoring.</p><p>But it has stoked a debate among politicians, parents and pundits that reflects an increasingly complex landscape in which <a href=\"https://apnews.com/general-news-3ab7ab8c73ac47e982699e08dd268d17\">Big Tobacco</a> companies aggressively push <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/8a37036ef489449d88b10bc4e960cfc9\">alternative products</a> while experts wrestle with their potential benefits and risks.</p><p>Zyn comes in flavors like mint, coffee and citrus, and Philip Morris International markets it to adult tobacco users. But videos of young people popping the pouches have racked up millions of views on TikTok and other social media platforms.</p><p>That trend has advocates worried that Zyn could become the latest <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fda-vapes-vaping-elf-bar-juul-80b2680a874d89b8d651c5e909e39e8f\">nicotine product</a> to attract underage teens, similar to the way <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/science-health-lawsuits-connecticut-fce3fe4f92066a9068cf505ed1fb63b0\">Juul</a> triggered a yearslong <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/23cd6c85396849e1acbb7d468d239d8c\">spike in vaping</a>. Other experts say that risk is outweighed by the potential to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/0fdefc03152c4034a1a254b6e71a7ff1\">steer adults away from cigarettes</a> and other traditional tobacco products, which account for 480,000 U.S. deaths annually.</p><p>\u201cThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result,\u201d said Dr. Jasjit Ahluwalia, an addiction specialist at Brown University. \u201cThat is what we\u2019ve done with tobacco for decades. We\u2019ve been all about abstinence, instead of embracing products that can reduce harm.\u201d</p><p>Ahluwalia sees nicotine pouches and e-cigarettes as a way to help smokers cut back or quit cigarettes.</p><p>That approach is standard practice in the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/3ff4e419802144998ca31ae88029457b\">U.K.</a>, but it\u2019s outside the medical mainstream in the U.S., where only pharmaceutical-grade medications like nicotine gum and lozenges are formally approved to help smokers quit.</p><p>Ahluwalia points out that Zyn works the same way as those products: releasing low levels of nicotine that are absorbed into the gums, reducing cravings. The chief difference, he notes, is that Zyn is sold by Philip Morris, the global cigarette giant and a longtime foe of anti-smoking groups.</p><p>The controversy around Zyn recently spilled over into politics, pitting Democrats and Republicans in Washington against each other and spiraling into another skirmish in the nation's culture war.</p><p>In late January, Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, of New York, called on regulators to investigate Zyn, citing its appeal to teens. Several House Republicans then warned constituents that \u201cBig Brother\u201d intended to \u201cban nicotine.\u201d</p><p>Conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, a Zyn user, jumped into the fray, declaring: \u201cZyn is not a sin,\u201d and touting its unproven benefits, like \u201cenhancing male vitality and mental acuity.\u201d</p><p>Zyn users have quickly developed their own online vocabulary, including \u201czynnies,\u201d \u201czynner\u201d and \u201czynsky.\"</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s this online subculture around Zyn that\u2019s been spearheaded by younger males, but a lot of that\u2019s not coming from the brand itself,\u201d said Ollie Ganz, a Rutgers University tobacco and nicotine researcher.</p><p>Online videos show young people documenting their first experiences trying Zyn, reviewing different flavor combinations and displaying heaping piles of used canisters.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s concerning to see the countless Zyn-related memes and hashtags that are being amplified and normalized across social media,\u201d said Kathy Crosby, CEO of the Truth Initiative, an anti-tobacco advocacy group.</p><p>Truth and other groups point to research suggesting nicotine can interfere with brain development in adolescents.</p><p>It\u2019s the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/politics-us-food-and-drug-administration-business-health-vaping-fc7a384693fb91861a6bb17e5b5bb6d9\">Food and Drug Administration\u2019s job</a> to weigh Zyn\u2019s risks to youngsters against its potential to help adults.</p><p>In a statement, an FDA spokesman said the agency is monitoring underage use, noting that 1.5% of high school and middle schoolers reported using pouches <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/teen-vaping-smoking-cdc-survey-d1f44bd3d8df6960215a14454f5e2e6e\">last year</a>. That\u2019s well below the 10% who used e-cigarettes.</p><p>FDA officials have allowed Zyn to stay on the market while they review Philip Morris\u2019 marketing application, which has been pending since 2020. If teen use remains low, the company could win FDA authorization for at least some of its offerings, which come in multiple strengths and flavors.</p><p>In 2019, the FDA awarded its first-ever reduced risk designation to a similar product: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/84141a5ce4d04dffa33341402ba75eeb\">snus, a tobacco pouch</a> popular in Sweden that contains lower levels of carcinogens than cigarettes. The FDA said smokers who switch to snus reduce their risk of lung cancer, bronchitis and other diseases.</p><p>Zyn excludes the tobacco leaves found in snus, leaving only nicotine, which Philip Morris says increases its appeal.</p><p>\u201cPeople can be reluctant to move into an oral tobacco product if they view it as similar to traditional chewing tobacco,\u201d company spokesman Corey Henry said. \u201cConsumer acceptability is a big part of Zyn.\u201d</p><p>Philip Morris doesn\u2019t use online influencers or endorsements to promote Zyn, Henry said. Its website is restricted to adults 21 and older. And flavors like cinnamon and peppermint are \u201cfamiliar to adults,\u201d Henry said.</p><p>Zyn launched in the U.S. in 2014, but sales have exploded in the past year, generating $1.8 billion as shipments accelerated year-over-year by over 60%.</p><p>On a November call with retailers, one company executive called the growth \u201cgonzo\u201d and \u201clights out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see this coming. I don\u2019t know anyone who did,\u201d said Joseph Teller, a director for oral tobacco products.</p><p>Zyn promotions emphasize the pouches' discreet, convenient nature as a \u201csmoke-free,\u201d \u201cspit-free\u201d alternative for smokers \u201cat work\u201d or \u201con the move.\u201d</p><p>But to fulfill the company\u2019s stated goal of a \u201csmoke-free future,\u201d Zyn will need to help users fully switch from cigarettes, rather than alternating between the two.</p><p>There\u2019s little data on switching, and preliminary research suggests pouches may not be a great substitute.</p><p>Ohio State University researchers recently found it took smokers 30 minutes to an hour to get enough nicotine from Zyn to relieve their cravings. With cigarettes, smokers achieved the same nicotine levels \u2014 and relief \u2014 in five minutes.</p><p>\u201cThe pouches we studied, especially the lower nicotine concentrations, did not appear to meet the needs of smokers,\u201d said Brittney Keller-Hamilton, who led the study. \u201cThat being said, they didn\u2019t totally flop either.\u201d</p><p>For now, smokers who have had success with Zyn say they hope it stays available.</p><p>Justin Wafer, 39, was smoking a pack a day last spring while working as a bartender in Portland, Oregon. On busy days, he would also vape if he didn\u2019t have time to step away for a smoke break.</p><p>But after his reloadable electronic cigarette broke in May, he decided to try Zyn. These days, he usually pops a pouch every three to four hours and says he hasn\u2019t smoked in more than nine months.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how it\u2019s any different from pharmaceutical solutions like lozenges or gum,\u201d he says. \u201cExcept it\u2019s easier to get and tastes better.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
