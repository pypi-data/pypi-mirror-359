Three IVF providers in Alabama paused services after the state Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos were considered \u201cextrauterine children\u201d under the state wrongful death law. Lawmakers in both chambers on Thursday advanced legislation that should shield IVF providers from civil lawsuits and prosecution for the \u201cdamage to or death of an embryo\u201d during IVF services. Legislators are hoping to get the measures approved by early next week while they weigh whether additional action is needed. More than 200 IVF patients filled the Statehouse on Wednesday pressuring lawmakers to get IVF services in the state restarted.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) \u2014 Facing public pressure to get in vitro fertilization services restarted, Alabama lawmakers moved closer to approving protections for fertility clinics that shut down after a state court <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alabama-supreme-court-from-embryos-161390f0758b04a7638e2ddea20df7ca\">ruled that frozen embryos</a> are the legal equivalent of children.</p><p>Both chambers of the Alabama Legislature advanced bills Thursday that would shield clinics from prosecution and civil lawsuits. Each bill now moves to the opposite chamber for debate. Bill sponsor Rep. Terri Collins said they are aiming to get the measure approved and to the governor on Wednesday.</p><p>\u201cThis would at least keep the clinics open and the families moving forward,\u201d Collins said. She described the legislation as a temporary fix while lawmakers weigh if additional action is needed.</p><p>The Alabama Supreme Court ruled in mid-February that three couples who had frozen embryos destroyed in an accident at a storage facility could pursue wrongful death lawsuits for their \u201cextrauterine children.\u201d The ruling, treating an embryo the same as a child or gestating fetus under the wrongful death statute, raised concerns about civil liabilities for clinics. Three major providers announced a pause on IVF services.</p><p>Republicans\u2019 proposal focused on lawsuit protections instead of attempting to address the legal status of embryos. The legislation would shield providers from prosecution and civil lawsuits related to the \u201cdamage to or death of an embryo\u201d during IVF services.</p><p>The bills advanced with broad bipartisan support. Representatives voted 94-6 for the proposal, and state senators voted 32-0 for it.</p><p>Some Republicans said they want to consider future restriction on what happens to unused embryos.</p><p>Republican Rep. Ernie Yarbrough of Trinity tried unsuccessfully to put an amendment on the bill that would prohibit clinics from intentionally discarding embryos that are unused or after genetic testing.</p><p>Republican Rep. Mark Gidley of Hokes Bluff said he wants lawmakers to consider putting regulation on fertility clinics</p><p>\u201cThis is what is important to me and a lot of members of this House. Understand, that once that is fertilized, it begins to grow, even though it may not be in a woman's uterus,\u201d Gidley said.</p><p>A Democratic lawmaker said the state, which has a stringent abortion ban with no exceptions for rape, has spent too much time interfering with the decisions of women.</p><p>\u201cI am so tired of folks telling me as a female in Alabama what I\u2019m going to do with my own body. It\u2019s time that we stop this,\u201d Democratic Rep. Barbara Drummond of Mobile said. She said a woman texted her this morning asking if the state would take \u201ccustody\u201d and responsibility of her frozen embryos if they are now considered children.</p><p>Democrats in the Alabama Senate had unsuccessfully tried to amend the bill to state that a human embryo outside a uterus can not be considered an unborn child or human being under state law. Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison, a Democrat from Birmingham, said that was the most direct way to deal with the issue. Republicans blocked the amendment from coming up for a vote.</p><p>In their ruling, Alabama justices <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/9169e683e92f452d8ac34e6d7d9c7d05\">cited anti-abortion language added</a> to the Alabama Constitution in 2018, saying Alabama recognizes and protects the \u201crights of unborn children.\u201d The constitutional amendment was approved by 59% of Alabama voters.</p><p>Rep. Chris England, a Democrat from Tuscaloosa, said lawmakers may be able to provide a temporary solution through legislation but a long-term solution must address the 2018 constitutional amendment, which he said essentially established \u201cpersonhood\u201d for embryos.</p><p>\u201cThere are far-reaching ramifications of personhood,\u201d England said.</p><p>More than 200 IVF patients filled the Statehouse on Wednesday pressuring lawmakers to get IVF services restarted in the state. They showed lawmakers babies created through IVF treatment or described how the ruling halted their path to parenthood.</p><p>LeeLee Ray underwent eight miscarriages, one ectopic pregnancy and multiple surgeries before turning to surrogacy in hopes of having a child. She and her husband found a surrogate through a matching program, but now can\u2019t have their embryos transferred to her and are unable to move their embryos out of state.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just frustrated. We had a light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Ray said Wednesday.</p>",
