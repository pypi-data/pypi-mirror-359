In addition, the country plans more food imports and is mobilizing United Nations agencies and local businesses to assist.</p><p>The drought has destroyed about 1 million hectares (2.5 million acres) of the 2.2 million hectares (5.4 million acres) planted with the staple maize crop, he said.</p><p>\u201cThis drought has devastating consequences on many sectors such as agriculture, water availability and energy supply, risking our national food security and the livelihoods of millions of our people. The dry spell is projected to continue even into the month of March, affecting over 1 million of our farming households,\u201d said Hichilema.</p><p>Electricity generation has not been spared, with the country expecting a power deficit of about 430 megawatts \u201cpotentially reaching 520 megawatts by December,\u201d he said, as water levels decline at the country\u2019s major source of hydro power, the Kariba Dam, which it shares with neighbor, Zimbabwe.</p><p>To cope, the country will import electricity and also ration supplies to its approximately 20 million people, he said.</p><p>Zambia was recently hit by one of its worst cholera outbreaks that killed more than 400 people and infected more than 10,000.</p><p>Some Zambians, weary of continued crises, have coined songs labeling the outbreaks of coronavirus and cholera as well as the current drought as a \u201ctriple tragedy,\u201d said Hichilema.</p><p>Although many countries in southern Africa are yet to declare a national disaster, they are also in a dire situation because of the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wildlife-drought-climate-change-zimbabwe-africa-94a63855745dc1bfb5708c42d6b3fe01\">influence of El Nino weather patterns</a>, according to the U.N agency, the World Food Program.</p><p>Parts of Zambia, Zimbabwe and Botswana are experiencing the driest February in the past 40 years, while severe rainfall shortages have been recorded in southern Malawi, eastern Angola and parts of Mozambique, said the WFP in a bulletin this week.</p><p>The United States Agency for International Development, the U.S. government\u2019s foreign aid agency, has estimated through its Famine Early Warning Systems Network that 20 million people in southern Africa will need food relief between January and March.</p><p>Many people in the areas of highest concern such as Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, parts of Mozambique and southern Madagascar will be unable to feed themselves into early 2025 due to El Nino, USAID said.</p>",
