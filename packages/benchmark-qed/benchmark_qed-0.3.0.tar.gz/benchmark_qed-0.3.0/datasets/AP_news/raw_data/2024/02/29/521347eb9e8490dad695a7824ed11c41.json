    "body_nitf": "<p>Health care providers across the country are reeling from a cyberattack on a massive U.S. health care technology company that has threatened the security of patients\u2019 information and is delaying some prescriptions and paychecks for medical workers.</p><p>The hack could also disrupt discharging people from the hospital, a major hospital association said.</p><p>Change Healthcare announced Thursday that a ransomware group that had claimed responsibility for the attack was at fault. Change Healthcare also said it is assessing the impact of the attack, which it first acknowledged on Feb. 21 and has affected billing and care-authorization portals across the country.</p><p>\u201cPatient care is our top priority and we have multiple workarounds to ensure people have access to the medications and the care they need,\u201d Change Healthcare said in a statement.</p><p>Owned by UnitedHealth Group, Change Healthcare manages health care technology pipelines, processing 14 billion transactions a year. The company said its investigation determined that Change Healthcare, Optum, UnitedHealthcare and UnitedHealth Group systems have been affected. Change also confirmed Thursday that ransomware group ALPHV, or Blackcat, made the breach. The company didn't respond to a question about whether it paid or negotiated a ransom.</p><p>One of the most immediate impacts is that people are seeing delays in getting prescriptions, American Hospital Association spokesperson Ben Teicher said. Change Healthcare said most affected pharmacies are using workarounds like writing things down.</p><p>But the severity of the situation may still be unfolding, the American Hospital Association said in an email to The Associated Press. Hospitals are having issues with processing claims, billing patients and checking insurance coverage for care, the AHA said, but the attack also could affect the ability to pay workers and buy medicine and supplies.</p><p>\u201cThe impact to hospitals is just now really starting to crystallize and as a result has been underreported,\u201d Teicher said. \u201cAs a result we can\u2019t really speak to the longer term aftermath, but it can result in hospitals not being able to make payroll or patients still waiting for services to be approved.\u201d</p><p>Health systems told the Healthcare Association of New York State that they\u2019ve had trouble with various things, including \u201can inability to verify patient eligibility and coverage \u2026 communicate pharmacy prescriptions, file claims \u2026 and receive normal cash flow to support operations, among other issues,\u201d association president Bea Grause said.</p><p>Several major health care providers that serve multiple states did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Cybersecurity <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cyberattacks-hospital-lurie-childrens-ransom-eb6f9528198b4e3c2a5e82f74c4cb7e9\">experts say</a> ransomware attacks have increased substantially in recent years, especially in the health care sector. This one comes on the heels of an attack last month on a children\u2019s hospital in Chicago, which had to take phone, email and medical records systems offline.</p><p>An FBI spokesperson in Tennessee said he could not confirm or deny whether the FBI is investigating. The FBI also said it's \u201caware of this incident\u201d but didn't have anything else to provide because the incident \"is ongoing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as we can tell, the attack is being contained,\u201d said Allan Liska, a threat intelligence analyst at Recorded Future. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get worse. But when you have a critical system like this that\u2019s down for an extended period \u2026 the longer it\u2019s down and the longer that recovery takes, the more impact it\u2019s going to have on patient care.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>AP correspondent Adrian Sainz in Memphis and Lindsey Whitehurst in Washington contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
