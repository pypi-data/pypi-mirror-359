The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced the fine in a letter to the owners of Northview Village. It closed suddenly on Dec. 15 as the company that owned it struggled to meet payroll. Many patients left with nothing but the clothes they were wearing, creating confusion and spurring outrage among residents and their families.",

Starting then and lasting through Dec. 17, when Northview gave up its Medicare and Medicaid contracts, it was \u201cin violation,\u201d documents released this week show.</p><p>The letter from the federal agency says that if Northview waives its rights to a hearing, the $18,770-per-day penalty for that three-day span will be reduced by 35%.</p><p>Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, an advocacy group, said that is the norm for the agency's penalties. He said fines frequently are reduced or eliminated.</p><p>\u201cGiven what happened here, I think it\u2019s a fine that\u2019s well below what the egregious behavior of this operator merits,\u201d he said.</p><p>Members of the nursing home\u2019s ownership group did not immediately return calls from the Post-Dispatch or The Associated Press seeking comment Wednesday.</p><p>The closure was chaotic, with many patients left with nothing but the clothes they were wearing, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nursing-home-closure-st-louis-c6021c6ff235ebdbc3e458d8ab7a27b2\">creating confusion and spurring outrage</a> among residents and their families.

Cori Bush, a St. Louis Democrat, called for a federal investigation of the owners as well as a probe of Missouri\u2019s system of overseeing nursing homes.</p><p>As of Wednesday, Bush\u2019s office had not received any response from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and was not aware of any other actions taken on Northview.</p>",
