Thursday's ruling granted a motion for summary judgment filed by Planned Parenthood of Montana. One law sought to ban telehealth prescriptions of abortion medication and required a 24-hour waiting period after giving informed consent. Another law required providers to offer patients the option of viewing an ultrasounds or listening to the fetal heart tone. The state plans to appeal to the Montana Supreme Court. The judge's ruling was based on a 1999 Montana Supreme Court ruling that held the state Constitution's right to privacy protects the right to a pre-viability abortion.",

But she said the organization's efforts continue, noting Montana's Legislature in 2023 passed another slate of bills seeking to limit abortion access.</p><p>\u201cWe will never stop working to ensure that all Montanans and those who are forced to travel here for care can access the care they need,\u201d Fuller said.</p><p>District Court Judge Kurt Krueger's decision cited a 1999 Montana Supreme Court ruling that said the state Constitution's right to privacy includes a woman's right to obtain a pre-viability abortion from the provider of her choice. That ruling did not say at what point a fetus becomes viable, saying it is a complex concept determined by medical judgment and that cannot be reduced to a gestational age.</p><p>The state argued that the 1999 Armstrong ruling was wrongly decided and has tried unsuccessfully on several occasions to get the Montana Supreme Court to overturn it.</p><p>The state plans to appeal Judge Krueger's ruling, said Emilee Cantrell, spokeswoman for the Department of Justice.</p><p>\u201cAttorney General Knudsen remains committed to protecting the health and safety of women and unborn babies in Montana,\u201d she said in an emailed statement.</p><p>However, Thursday's ruling notes that: \u201cCourts are particularly wary of ideological or sectarian legislation presented as healthcare interests.\u201d</p><p>Montana's Armstrong ruling said that legal limits imposed under the \u201cguise of protecting the patient's health,\u201d but actually driven by \u201cunrelenting pressure from individuals and organizations promoting their own beliefs\" are impermissible and \u201dmorally indefensible.\"</p><p>Abortion restrictions <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/montana-abortion-restriction-access-privacy-df49c7f6e92189215ce5d04ddee0e340\">passed in Montana in 2023</a> that are being challenged include one that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/montana-abortion-laws-challenged-0f6d7fc19a7b92f620a28cac0ea8daa1\">banned most dilation and evacuation abortions</a>, the type used most often after 15 weeks of gestation; one to require prior authorization before Medicaid would pay for abortions, and one to say only physicians and physician assistants can perform abortions.</p><p>Montana's Supreme Court ruled in May 2023 that properly trained <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/montana-abortion-advanced-nurses-midwives-5d5c7aa5a64aae4bca9dbd8f8f32ed50\">advanced practice registered nurses</a> can also provide abortion care.</p>",
