    "description_summary": "South Korea\u2019s government is making a last appeal to junior doctors to end a walkout just hours ahead of a Thursday deadline or risk the suspension of their medical licenses and prosecution. Thousands of medical interns and residents have been on strike for about 10 days to protest the government\u2019s push to boost medical school enrollments. Government officials warned that strikers would face legal repercussions if they didn\u2019t return to their hospitals by Thursday. As of Wednesday night, about 9,076 of the country\u2019s 13,000 medical interns and residents were not at their workplaces, according to the Health Ministry. Observers say many strikers are likely to defy the deadline.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 As South Korea\u2019s government made a last plea for junior doctors to end a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-doctors-walkouts-patients-explained-326632dd061fc3b004b663cc761f9016\">walkout</a> hours before a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-doctors-walkout-medical-school-17c805f9e5280419ac7273258dd03440\">Thursday deadline</a>, many were expected to defy orders to return to work, risking suspensions of medical licenses and prosecution.</p><p>Thousands of medical interns and residents have been on <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-trainee-doctors-walk-off-d991fc8a07c535ea737b4f31b01c5658\">strike</a> for about 10 days to protest the government\u2019s push to boost medical school enrollments. Government officials have warned that strikers would face legal repercussions if they don\u2019t return to their hospitals by Thursday.</p><p>As of Wednesday night, about 9,076 of the country\u2019s 13,000 medical interns and residents were confirmed to have left their hospitals after <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-doctors-protest-government-medical-school-e51be32b51831454b4b34e28fd74c19f\">submitting resignations</a>, according to the Health Ministry. It said 294 strikers had returned to work.</p><p>There was no word on any others going back to their jobs as of 10 p.m. (1300 GMT) Thursday.</p><p>Observers say many strikers are likely to defy the deadline, continuing the work boycott for weeks or months. The government is expected to begin formal steps <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-trainee-doctors-strike-walkout-hospitals-8a62a4d23b87019e75beac59c32698a2\">toward penalties</a> on Monday, as Friday is a national holiday.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve said that we won\u2019t hold them responsible for leaving their worksites if they return by today,\u201d Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo told a briefing. \u201cDoctors are there to serve patients, and those patients are anxiously waiting for you. This isn\u2019t the way to protest against the government.\u201d</p><p>Later Thursday, Park met some striking doctors for more than three hours, but there were no reports of a breakthrough. Officials invited 94 representatives of the strikers to the meeting, but Park said less than 10 showed up and they were ordinary strikers, not leaders. Park said they asked him about the government's recruitment plan and he called for them to end their walkouts.</p><p>Ryu Ok Hada, one of the striking doctors, told reporters that he wouldn\u2019t attend the meeting. He accused the government of treating the striking junior doctors \u201clike criminals and inflicting humiliation on them.\u201d</p><p>Starting March 4, the government will notify doctors who miss the deadline that it plans to suspend their licenses and will give them opportunities to respond, senior Health Ministry official Kim Chung-hwan said.</p><p>Under South Korean law, the government can order doctors back to work if it sees grave risks to public health. Those who refuse to abide by such orders can have their medical licenses suspended for up to one year and also face up to three years in prison or a 30 million won (roughly $22,500) fine. Those who receive prison sentences would be stripped of their medical licenses.</p><p>Some observers say authorities will probably punish only leaders of the strike to avoid further straining hospital operations.</p><p>At the center of the dispute is a government plan to admit 2,000 more applicants to medical schools starting next year, a two-thirds increase from the current 3,058. The government says it aims to add up to 10,000 new doctors by 2035 to cope with the country\u2019s fast-aging population. Officials say South Korea\u2019s doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest among industrialized countries.</p><p>But many doctors reject the plan, arguing that universities aren\u2019t ready to provide quality education to that many new students. They also say the government plan would also fail to address chronic shortage of doctors in essential but low-paying specialties like pediatrics and emergency departments.</p><p>But their critics say the striking junior doctors simply worry about expected lower income because of the sharply increased number of fellow doctors. The government\u2019s plan is broadly popular with the South Korean public, according to a poll.</p><p>\u201cDoctors must cure sick people. If they all leave, who\u2019s going to treat them? Everyone would die,\u201d Kim Young Ja, an 89-year-old housewife, said near a Seoul hospital.</p><p>The country\u2019s 13,000 trainee doctors represent a small fraction of South Korea\u2019s 140,000 doctors, but they account for about 30%-40% of the total doctors at some major hospitals and perform many vital functions to support senior medical staff.</p><p>The doctors\u2019 walkouts have caused the cancellation or delay of several hundred surgeries and other medical treatments at their hospitals, according to the Health Ministry. The ministry says the country\u2019s handling of emergency and critical patients remains largely stable, as public medical institutions extended their working hours and military hospitals opened their emergency rooms to the public.</p><p>But experts say if senior doctors join the trainee doctors\u2019 strikes, South Korea\u2019s medical service would suffer serious damage. The Korea Medical Association, which represents the country\u2019s 140,000 doctors, has said it <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-doctors-protest-medical-school-students-d6e52e839a20c92757ec9a3a89cf480b\">supports the trainee doctors</a>, but hasn\u2019t yet decided whether to join the walkouts.</p><p>A 60-year-old patient who was diagnosed with breast cancer six weeks ago said she hopes for an early end to the walkouts so that her treatment would go ahead smoothly.</p><p>\u201cFor my cancer not to worsen, I need to receive treatments at the right time. So I hope the trainee doctors will return to work as soon as possible, normalizing hospital operations,\u201d said the woman, who wished to be only identified by her surname, Yu, citing privacy concerns.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press journalists Ahn Young-joon, Yong Ho Kim and Yong Jun Chang contributed to this report.</p>",
