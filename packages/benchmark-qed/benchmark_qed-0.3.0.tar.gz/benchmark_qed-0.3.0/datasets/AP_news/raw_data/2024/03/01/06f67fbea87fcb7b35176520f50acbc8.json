The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has agreed that eating at least 2 cups of yogurt a week might reduce the risk of the disease. The agency granted a request for a qualified health claim from Danone North America. Such claims lack full scientific support but are allowed as long as they include disclaimers. Other such allowed claims include that some types of cocoa may reduce heart disease and cranberry juice might reduce the risk of recurrent UTIs.",

It submitted information from studies that observed participants over time and found a link between eating yogurt and lower markers of diabetes. The FDA agreed that there \u201cis some credible evidence\u201d of benefit from eating yogurt as a whole food, but not because of any particular nutrient in it.</p><p>Critics said the label change is not based on gold-standard randomized controlled trials that could have proven whether yogurt reduces diabetes risk.</p><p>No single food can reduce the risk of a disease that is tied to overall diet, the advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest said. It also said the label change might raise the risk of diabetes by encouraging consumption of yogurt, including types that include added sugars, and mix-ins such as cookies and pretzels.</p><p>Marion Nestle, a food policy expert, said qualified health claims based on limited evidence are \u201cridiculous on their face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTranslation: If you want to believe this, go ahead, but it's not on the basis of evidence,\u201d she said.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
