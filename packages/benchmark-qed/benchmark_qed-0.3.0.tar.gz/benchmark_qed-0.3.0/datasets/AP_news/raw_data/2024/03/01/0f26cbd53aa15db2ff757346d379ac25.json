    "description_summary": "A judge in Montana ruled against restrictions in one of several developments this week on how abortion works in the U.S. since Roe v. Wade was overturned. New data showed that the number of abortions is holding steady, but there have been changes in how and where they're provided. Meanwhile, two states advanced plans to do education via video. In West Virginia, a bill seeks to require students to watch a video on fetal development that a key Republican opposed, saying it doesn't square with science. In South Dakota, lawmakers want a video produced to teach medical providers about the narrow exception to the state's ban.",

Wade and the nationwide right to abortion, the details of what that means are still in flux. With lawsuits still pending and ballot questions on the horizon, that's the one thing that's not likely to change quickly.</p><p>Here are things to know about developments across the country this week.</p><hl2>MONTANA JUDGE BLOCKS RESTRICTIONS</hl2><p>A <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/montana-abortion-laws-court-ruling-e0f1372cdb3f241c9665cdf556adc65a\">Montana judge on Thursday rejected restrictions</a> on abortion that were adopted in 2021, possibly setting up a chance for the Montana Supreme Court to revisit its 1999 ruling that protected a woman's right to abortion until the fetus is viable.</p><p>The 2021 laws were put on hold and never took effect.</p><p>They would have banned abortion after 20 weeks' gestation, banned telehealth prescription of abortion pills, required a 24-hour waiting period after giving consent and required providers to show women an ultrasound or hear a fetal heart tone before providing an abortion.</p><p>The state government plans to appeal the ruling, possibly putting it on a path for another showdown at the state's top court. The high court has previously declined to reverse the 1999 decision \u2014 including when it backed up a lower court's decision to pause enforcement of the 2021 laws.</p><p>A judge last year also put on hold enforcement of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/montana-abortion-restriction-access-privacy-df49c7f6e92189215ce5d04ddee0e340\">more restrictions the state adopted</a> last year, including a ban on dilation and evacuation abortions \u2014 the most common procedure after 15 weeks' gestation.</p><p>Abortion rights groups are <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ballot-amendment-ban-protection-states-2024-052ff9846f8416efb725240af22b92ec\">pushing for a ballot question</a> to amend the state constitution to protect reproductive freedom, including the right to abortion.</p><hl2>REPORT FINDS CHANGES IN HOW ABORTIONS ARE PROVIDED</hl2><p>There have been legal and legislative battles over abortion access in the U.S. for generations, but everything changed when the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-politics-health-5101ede97957cbf5f4f8aac1d5e5b4fa\">U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade</a>, the 1973 ruling that had protected access nationwide.</p><p>Since then, bans have taken effect in most Republican-controlled states, including 14 where abortion is banned at all stages of pregnancy, with varying limited exceptions. Most Democrat-controlled states have sought to protect access.</p><p>Those changes are reflected in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-survey-wecount-telehealth-ban-e3c7c9539462eb924ad92f30c624f311\">data released this week</a> by #WeCount for the Society of Family Planning.
