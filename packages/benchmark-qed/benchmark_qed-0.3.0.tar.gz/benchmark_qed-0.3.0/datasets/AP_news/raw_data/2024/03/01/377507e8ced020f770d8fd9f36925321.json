With 5,275 dengue cases, Piura was by Friday the second most affected Peruvian city by dengue. But few days ago, it was the first one. Peru has registered more than 34,000 cases in the first seven weeks of this year, twice as high as in the same period in 2023, according to the health ministry. The government declared a health emergency in most of its provinces on Monday due to the growing number of cases, which come at a time of high temperatures caused by El Ni\u00f1o",

A few days ago, it was the hardest hit. In total, Peru has registered more than 34,000 cases of dengue in the first eight weeks of this year, twice as high as in the same period in 2023, according to the nation\u2019s health ministry.</p><p>Peru's government declared a health emergency in most of its provinces on Monday due to the rising number of cases, which come amid higher than normal temperatures caused by the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern.</p><p>Authorities in Piura have begun setting up specials areas in hospitals to receive dengue patients.</p><p>A dengue epidemic last year put Peru\u2019s public health system under strain as thousands sought care in emergency rooms. But while last year's epidemic killed 21 people in Peru, dengue has claimed the lives of 44 Peruvians in the first two months of this year alone.</p><p>Santiago Valdez, a specialist in tropical diseases sent to Piura, said the water shortage and storage practices are fueling the disease, which is spread by Aedes Aegypti, a mosquito that reproduces in hot and humid conditions.</p><p>\u201cPeople are forced to collect (water) and no matter how much one tries to have closed containers, there is always carelessness and the mosquitoes take the opportunity to lay their eggs and reproduce,\u201d he said.</p><p>Although most dengue cases present light symptoms, the disease can cause severe headaches, fevers and muscle pains.</p><p>In December, the World Health Organization said that Peru\u2019s 2023 dengue epidemic was linked to rains and hot temperatures that helped mosquito populations to grow, especially in the north of the country.</p><p>Health Minister C\u00e9sar V\u00e1squez acknowledged on Thursday that dengue \u201cis not under control\u201d and the cases \u201cwill continue to grow.\u201d</p>",
