Friday's ruling comes just a day after PFLAG sued to try to stop the state's effort to get the information. A judge says making the group comply would violate members' constitutional rights, including freedom of speech and association and protection from unreasonable searches. PFLAG and the state have been in court multiple times as Texas officials seek to curtail access to gender-affirming care for children.",

Additionally, the judge said, it would be a \u201cgross invasion\u201d of privacy.</p><p>A hearing was scheduled for March 25 to give the attorney general's office a chance to make the case for why Friday's order shouldn't continue.</p><p>This round of litigation stems from a request Paxton's office made in February for \u201cdocuments and communications\u201d about PFLAG CEO Brian Bond's statement to court last year that members were setting up contingency plans after the state imposed a sweeping ban on gender-affirming care for minors.</p><p>In a statement Thursday, Paxton's office said the information is highly relevant to investigations into whether medical providers are committing insurance fraud to circumvent the ban.</p><p>The ACLU, which is representing FPLAG in court, said it will seek a permanent block on Paxton's demand \u201cso that PFLAG can continue supporting its Texas members with transgender youth in doing what all loving parents do: supporting and caring for their children.\u201d</p><p>PFLAG and Texas have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/texas-lawsuits-d2af85158fd7dd1660b9d18871e0e7b0\">battled in court previously</a> including in 2022, when the state adopted a policy of investigating instances of gender-affirming care for children as child abuse cases.</p>",

While the primary focus is on the legal aspects and the conflict between the state and an LGBTQ+ advocacy group, the topic of gender-affirming care is inherently related to health. The document touches on the implications for medical providers and the care of transgender youth, which are relevant to health. However, the main emphasis is on the legal battle rather than health itself."
