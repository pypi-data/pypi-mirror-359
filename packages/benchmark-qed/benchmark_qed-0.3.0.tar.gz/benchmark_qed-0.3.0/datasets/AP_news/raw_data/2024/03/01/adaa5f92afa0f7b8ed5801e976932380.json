The chain will start with some locations in New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, California and Illinois.</p><p>He said the company was starting in \u201cin select locations to allow us to ensure quality, safety and privacy for our patients, providers and team members.\u201d</p><p>Thibault said CVS Health will add states \u201cwhere allowed by law, on a rolling basis.\u201d</p><p>The New York Times first reported the retailers' plans.</p><p>CVS Health Corp., the nation\u2019s largest drugstore chain, runs nearly 9,400 locations. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. has about 8,700 U.S. stores.</p><p>Their announcements Friday marked \u201can important milestone\u201d in ensuring mifepristone access, President Joe Biden said in a statement. He noted that many women will soon be able to pick up their prescriptions at a local, certified pharmacy like they would any other medication.</p><p>\u201cI encourage all pharmacies that want to pursue this option to seek certification,\u201d he said.</p><p>The moves by CVS and Walgreens come more than a year after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration finalized <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-medication-d5fc3d5990dced69b0bf93a4760250fe\">a rule change</a> that broadened availability of abortion pills to many more pharmacies, including large chains and mail-order companies.</p><p>The FDA in 2000 approved mifepristone to terminate pregnancies of up to 10 weeks, when used with a second drug, misoprostol.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mifepristone-supreme-court-abortion-d451e14148ffbe6ce4811b1a37651480\">Mifepristone</a> is taken first to dilate the cervix and block the hormone progesterone, which is needed to sustain a pregnancy. Misoprostol is taken 24 to 48 hours later, causing the uterus to contract and expel pregnancy tissue.</p><p>For more than 20 years, the FDA labeling had limited dispensing to a subset of specialty offices and clinics, due to safety concerns.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-abortion-medication-drug-mifepristone-f763b93ef632e1767fd696caec686c21\">The U.S. Supreme Court</a> is weighing a challenge from conservative groups who are seeking to reverse mifepristone\u2019s approval or roll back policies that have made it easier to obtain.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
