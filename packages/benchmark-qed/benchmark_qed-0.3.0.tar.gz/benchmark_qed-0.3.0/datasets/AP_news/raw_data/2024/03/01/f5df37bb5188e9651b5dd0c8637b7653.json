There were no details of his illness. His son, Crown Prince Haakon, has said his father's condition was improving and that he needed rest before being brought back.</p><p>Norwegian TV2 said that a Scandinavian aircraft with the tail number LN-RPJ took off from Oslo Airport on Thursday, The Boeing 737-700 airline, which has previously been used as a flying ambulance, landed in Langkawi on Friday.</p><p>The royal house said Friday in a brief statement that the monarch's condition was improving but he would remain \u201cin hospital for a few more days for treatment and rest before returning home.\u201d</p><p>Norway's Armed Forces said Friday that they do not share information about ongoing operational missions, the armed forces said in a separate statement. \u201cIt is particularly important for us to maintain this practice, for the safety and health of His Majesty the King.\u201d</p><p>Norwegian TV2 said the same aircraft was used last summer for the medical evacuation of patients from Ukraine.</p><p>Malaysian national news agency Bernama has reported that Harald was undergoing treatment at the Sultanah Maliha Hospital in Langkawi. It cited unnamed sources as saying he was staying in the hospital\u2019s Royal Suite. The hospital declined to comment when contacted by The Associated Press.</p><p>\u201cIt is clear that his age means that it is good to treat this properly.
