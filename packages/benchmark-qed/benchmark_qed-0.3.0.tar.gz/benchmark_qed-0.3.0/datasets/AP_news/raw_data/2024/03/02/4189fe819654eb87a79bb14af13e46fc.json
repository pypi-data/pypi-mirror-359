The Medical Association of the State of Alabama and the Alabama Hospital Association filed a brief Friday supporting a rehearing request in the case. Courts do not often grant such requests. But the organizations argued that the decision is having sweeping consequences as fertility clinics pause IVF services. Last month Alabama justices said three couples could pursue wrongful death lawsuits for their \u201cextrauterine children\u201d after their frozen embryos were destroyed in an accident at a storage facility.",
