The unit is the first in the state and one of only a handful nationwide. It provides accommodations to help prisoners who struggle with overstimulation and physical coping needs. There is no comprehensive count on how many prisoners in the U.S. have developmental disabilities, and experts disagree on whether it\u2019s better to segregate them or to provide more accommodations in the general prison population. But they agree on one thing: It\u2019s a growing population that has presented a challenge for prison officials as they try to balance a need for security with disability accommodations.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>ALBION, Pa. (AP) \u2014 \u201cYou are the Lighthouse in someone\u2019s storm,\u201d reads the message above a mural of a sailboat bobbing on ocean waves under a cloud-studded azure sky. It's an unexpected slogan for a prison wall.</p><p>On a nearby door painted deep blue, a bright yellow Minion character offers \u201cWays to say hello,\u201d lists of suggestions about how prisoners incarcerated in a segregated unit of Pennsylvania\u2019s State Correctional Institution at Albion can best greet each other. A handful of \u201csensory\u201d rooms in the unit offer calming blue walls where harsh fluorescent lighting is dimmed by special covers.</p><p>The unique environment is part of a program aimed at providing better serving prisoners with intellectual or developmental disabilities, a growing population that has presented a challenge for corrections officials as they try to balance the need for security with accommodations, according to experts.</p><p>Such prisoners often struggle with overstimulation, inflexibility and trouble with complex directions, resulting in strong reactions that can lead to further discipline. They also grapple with social boundaries, making them more vulnerable to abuse, violence or manipulation in prison, said Steven Soliwoda, creator of Albion's Neurodevelopmental Residential Treatment Unit.</p><p>In a regular prison setting, many of these prisoners with autism and similar disabilities \u201cwould normally have kind of gotten through their incarceration just quietly,\" said Soliwoda, who is also program manager at Albion. \"Maybe they would have been a recluse or spent a lot of time in their cell. But their voices are heard in the program and they develop that independence and the social skills they need to survive when they get out of here.\u201d</p><p>There is no comprehensive count of how many prisoners in the U.S. have autism or intellectual disabilities, though some studies estimate more than 4% are autistic and almost 25% reported having cognitive impairments, according to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics \u2014 nearly twice the rate of each in the overall population. Many advocates believe the number could be much higher because of underdiagnosis before prison or because of ineffectual or nonexistent screening at some corrections departments.</p><p>The Neurodevelopmental Residential Treatment Unit, located roughly 20 miles (32 kilometers) outside of Erie, Pennsylvania, was started about three years ago and is the only facility of its kind in the state. The unit houses about 45 men \u2014 a small population that helps staff focus on individual treatment and limits some of the sensory stimulation of prison, Soliwoda said.</p><p>There\u2019s an exercise yard not accessible by the prison\u2019s general population, and prisoners stay in the unit to receive their medication and see specialized treatment staff. They can check out puzzles, yoga mats or drawing supplies to help them cope in overwhelming moments. One prisoner spends hours every day juggling in the common area to help calm his mind \u2014 something that wouldn\u2019t be allowed in most units.</p><p>\u201cMy first impression I got was, 'Wow, this is more like a therapy and rehabilitation for criminals with all these paintings and like positive messages surrounding it,\u201d said Christopher, a prisoner diagnosed with a form of autism.</p><p>Sean, a prisoner diagnosed with autism and intellectual disabilities, said he felt safe here. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the general population where I would be more prone to being bullied and stuff like that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get to learn about how to cope and how to recognize your emotions.\u201d</p><p>Soliwoda said he hopes to bring more programming to the unit as it continues to evolve. For now, though, corrections department officials don\u2019t have plans to expand the model to other prisons. Critics say that's a mistake, that with more than 36,000 people incarcerated in Pennsylvania state prisons, there are likely many more prisoners with these disabilities.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there are enough accommodations provided in our jails and prisons for all kinds of disabilities,\u201d said Leigh Anne McKingsley, senior director of Disability and Justice Initiatives at The Arc, a nonprofit organization serving people with intellectual and developmental limitations. For prisoners with these challenges, she said, \u201cthe accommodations are even less.\u201d</p><p>\"Those disabilities seem to get lost,\u201d McKingsley said.</p><p>Because prisons are often closed from public view, it\u2019s unclear what accommodations they provide or how many have specialized units. The Arc has been working to gather that information while offering training to everyone from police to prison staff on better ways to identify and interact with prisoners with disabilities.</p><p>The unit at Albion requires corrections officers to undergo regular training on de-escalation and crisis intervention to maintain a secure environment while offering accommodations. In Indiana, where there isn\u2019t a specialized developmental disability unit, Nick Stellema, the state's Americans with Disabilities Act coordinator, has helped corrections staff with tools to communicate with nonverbal autistic prisoners.</p><p>Stellema and other advocates are wary of segregating prisoners with disabilities, noting that the ADA is meant to ensure people can integrate with others, even in detention.</p><p>\u201cIn the free world, these individuals have to interact with everyone, not just with other people with disabilities,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the whole system would benefit from a better understanding of what an accommodation can be.\u201d</p><p>But other advocates say separating prisoners with these disabilities is the best option.</p><p>\u201cOne of the biggest things we hear is they are acting up and getting themselves put in solitary, and that is even more devastating for them,\u201d said Brian Kelmar, president and founder of the nonprofit organization Decriminalize Developmental Disabilities. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is, after solitary, the ways they have learned to interact all reverse. They regress from all gains they\u2019ve made.\u201d</p><p>At Albion, staff use so-called transitional cells as an intervention when they see certain behaviors. The stripped-down cells, equipped with safety features, are a place where the prisoners can go to regain control over their emotions while they work on completing goals set by the psychiatric staff before they are allowed to return to the rest of the unit.</p><p>\u201cYou get time to cool off and reflect for however long the staff feels you need to have that time with yourself,\u201d said Colin, a prisoner diagnosed with autism and schizophrenia. \"And instead of resulting in an infraction right away, you\u2019re resulting in more growth.\u201d</p><p>Randy Kulesza, a psychological services specialist in the unit, says the cells are a huge help to the prisoners and don't threaten their chance at parole.</p><p>\u201cIt absolutely cuts down on misconducts that these guys have received. ... I think this is a way we\u2019re able to address those things before they escalate and still keep these guys having some hope for the future,\u201d he said.</p>",
