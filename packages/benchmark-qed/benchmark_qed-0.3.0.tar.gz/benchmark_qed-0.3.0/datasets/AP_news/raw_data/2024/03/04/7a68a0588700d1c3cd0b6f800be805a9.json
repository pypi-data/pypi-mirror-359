That brings to a close the last coronavirus prevention protocol at the White House. The White House says the change aligns its policies with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. The CDC last week relaxed its recommendation for those who test positive for COVID-19 to isolate for five days. The agency says people can return to work or regular activities if their symptoms are mild and improving and it\u2019s been a day since they\u2019ve had a fever.",
