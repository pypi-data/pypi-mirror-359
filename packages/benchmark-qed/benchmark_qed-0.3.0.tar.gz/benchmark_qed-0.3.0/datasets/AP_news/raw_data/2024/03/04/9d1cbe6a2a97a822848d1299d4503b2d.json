Under the agreements, most of the money is to be used to address the overdose epidemic.</p><p>The foundation will allocate up to $51 million in its 2024 grant cycle for Ohio-based non-profits, for-profits and government entities alike who are \u201con the frontlines of Ohio\u2019s opioid battle.\u201d The program is the first of its kind in the United States.</p><p>Those applying must still follow certain parameters outlined by OneOhio, including that all programs and services proposed must be \u201cevidence-based, forward-looking strategies for prevention, treatment, (and) recovery support services.\u201d</p><p>Eligible projects may span one, two or three years and must be regionally-focused. Registration starts Monday and applications are due by May 3.</p><p>Alisha Nelson, executive director of OneOhio, said in a press release that the foundation understands how urgent the need to disperse the settlement money is as the state continues to feel the impact of the opioid epidemic.</p><p>\u201cAfter months of carefully developing this first-ever program, we look forward to seeing the innovative ideas presented to combat the epidemic in every corner of the state,\" Nelson said.</p><p>The foundation is registered as a private non-profit organization, though it was launched by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and GOP Attorney General Dave Yost in 2021. It's governed by a 29-member statewide board, many of which are state lawmakers and the appointees of state officials, but also includes addiction experts from across Ohio.</p><p>It has previously faced scrutiny, as well as <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ohio-supreme-court-opioid-settlement-public-records-9a0c7a5c2cca71cf6bf7c4ab31b77e06\">a lawsuit</a>, over <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-ohio-lawsuits-covid-philanthropy-5e7a9cb18bd5a37061a6802059f9b15f\">lacking transparency</a>.</p><p>Last summer, DeWine appointed Nelson as the foundation's first ever permanent executive director.</p><p>\u201cAfter careful consideration, I selected Alisha to fill this role because I know that she shares my vision of intentionally using these settlement funds to help Ohioans struggling with substance use disorder for years to come,\u201d DeWine said last year.</p><p>___</p><p>Samantha Hendrickson is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative. <a href=\"https://www.reportforamerica.org/\">Report for America</a> is a nonprofit national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on undercovered issues.</p>",
