Manufacturer Perrigo said Monday that it has begun shipping the medication, called Opill, to major retailers and pharmacies. A one-month supply will cost about $20 and a three-month supply will cost around $50. The Food and Drug Administration last July said the once-a-day pill could be sold without a prescription. It will also be available online. The pill is a hormone-based contraceptive, similar to drugs used by millions of U.S. women for decades. Birth control pills are available without a prescription across much of South America, Asia and Africa.",

A one-month supply will cost about $20 and a three-month supply will cost around $50, according to the company's suggested retail price. It will also be sold online.</p><p>The launch has been closely watched since last July, when the Food and Drug Administration said the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-science-health-birth-control-861d6d425e692ee1ead1d59926e5f3cd\">once-a-day Opill</a> could be sold without a prescription. Ireland-based Perrigo noted there will be no age restrictions on sales, similar to other over-the-counter medications.</p><p>Opill is an older class of contraceptive, sometimes called minipills, that contain a single synthetic hormone, progestin, and generally carry fewer side effects than more popular combination estrogen and progestin pills.</p><p>The launch gives U.S. women another birth control option amid the legal and political battles over reproductive health, including the reversal of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0\">Roe v.

And anti-abortion groups have generally emphasized that they do not oppose contraceptives to prevent pregnancies.</p><p>Birth control pills are available without a prescription across much of South America, Asia and Africa.</p><p>The drug\u2019s approval came despite some <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/birth-control-pills-without-prescription-3228f5d93f5b6583cdc1be9ce4557373\">concerns by FDA scientists</a> about the company\u2019s results, including whether women with certain medical conditions would understand that they shouldn\u2019t take the drug.</p><p>Dr. Verda Hicks, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in a statement, said studies have shown that patients, including adolescents, can effectively screen themselves to use the pills.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
