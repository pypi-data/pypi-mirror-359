A state House of Representatives <a href=\"https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/cteeInfo/Index.cfm?CteeBody=H&Code=60\">judiciary committee hearing</a> Tuesday is expected to focus on the use of it.</p><p>The federal suit filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against the state Department of Corrections argues that people incarcerated have suffered from increased mental health struggles. Some have been in solitary confinement for up to 12 years consecutively. The six inmates are incarcerated at six different facilities.</p><p>A spokesperson for the state Department of Corrections declined comment, saying the agency does not comment on litigation.</p><p>Lawyers say the state Department of Corrections is violating the constitutional rights of those incarcerated and is discriminatory by punishing people for symptoms of mental illness.</p><p>In solitary, people are confined to their cell for a majority of the day, with limited time for visitation or to leave their cell. If they do leave their cells, they are often restrained. They have limited access to hot water for showering. Fluorescent lights are on in their cells constantly, making it difficult to sleep. The environment is loud, with slamming steel doors and screaming of people having mental health crises.</p><p>The complaint alleges that mental health visits are not private, are conducted through the food slot in the steel doors and only last seconds.</p><p>Many of the plaintiffs have harmed themselves or attempted suicide while in solitary confinement, according to the complaint.</p><p>Khalil Hammond, a 35-year-old plaintiff, has spent 12 years in solitary. He is currently incarcerated at the State Correctional Institution at Phoenix in Collegeville, Pennsylvania. Hammond has a history of mental illness, which has worsened in confinement. He has attempted suicide eight times, according to the complaint.</p><p>He is unable to participate in programming to become eligible for parole and has not been able to connect often with his family. He is not able to marry his fianc\u00e9 while in solitary.</p><p>\u201cSolitary confinement is killing us. If you didn\u2019t have mental health issues before going in, you do once you\u2019re in the hole,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cImagine being locked in a cage for years and years without ever knowing when you\u2019ll get out.\u201d</p><p>Malika Henderson, 29, has been in solitary confinement for 22 months consecutively. She is incarcerated at State Correctional Institution at Muncy. She\u2019s spent about six years cumulatively in solitary confinement.</p><p>After her grandmother died in February and she was unable to attend funeral services virtually, she attempted suicide, the complaint states.</p><p>\u201cBeing in solitary confinement away from your loved ones and family is devastating,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m suffering but I know with this lawsuit I\u2019m not just fighting for me, I\u2019m fighting for the thousands of men and women who are in solitary just like me and who need to get out.\u201d</p><p>Saleem Holbrook, executive director of the Abolitionist Law Center, one of the law firms involved in the case, called it a historic filing.</p><p>\u201cEnding solitary confinement is necessary on grounds of humanity and as a matter of public health,\u201d Holbrook said in a statement. \u201cThe damage and devastation incarcerated people experience in solitary confinement has long-term and widespread consequences impacting individuals, families, and the communities those individuals return home to.\u201d</p>",
