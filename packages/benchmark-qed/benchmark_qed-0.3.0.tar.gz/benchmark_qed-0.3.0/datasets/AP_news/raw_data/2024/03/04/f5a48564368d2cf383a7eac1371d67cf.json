They believe this advance could open up new areas of prenatal medicine. Mini organs are tiny structures that can be used to test new medical treatments or study how the real organs they mimic work when healthy or diseased. Researchers say this is the first time \u201corganoids\u201d have been grown from cells collected during an active pregnancy. They envision the approach could eventually help doctors monitor and treat congenital conditions before birth and develop personalized therapies for a baby in the womb.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>Scientists have created miniorgans from cells floating in the fluid that surrounds a fetus in the womb \u2013 an advance they believe could open up new areas of prenatal medicine.</p><p>Miniorgans, or \u201c <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/science-health-14edb6a6d19893c3dd15a879f3cd2a56\">organoids</a>,\u201d are tiny simplified structures that can be used to test new medical treatments or study how the real organs they mimic work, whether they are healthy or diseased.</p><p>Researchers from University College London and Great Ormond Street Hospital in the United Kingdom collected cells from amniotic fluid samples taken during 12 pregnancies as part of routine prenatal testing. Then, for the first time, they grew mini-organs from cells taken during active pregnancies. They envision their approach could eventually help doctors monitor and treat congenital conditions before birth and develop personalized therapies for a baby in the womb.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re really excited\u201d about that possibility, said Mattia Gerli of University College London, an author of the study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine.</p><p>The tissue-specific stem cells Gerli and his colleagues collected were shed by the fetus, as normally happens during pregnancy. The scientists identified which tissues the stem cells came from, and found cells from the lungs, kidneys and intestines.</p><p>Previously, mini-organs have been derived from adult stem cells, which <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10192887/\">more closely resemble adult tissue</a>, or fetal tissue after an abortion.</p><p>Collecting cells from amniotic fluid gets around regulations about taking stem cells directly from fetal tissue, allowing these scientists to get cells from fetuses into the latter part of pregnancy. In the U.K., the legal limit for terminating a pregnancy is generally 22 weeks after conception. Scientists can\u2019t get fetal samples after that, limiting their ability to study normal human development or congenital diseases past that point.</p><p>In the U.S., abortion restrictions vary by state. It\u2019s legal in most to use fetal tissue for research, said Alta Charo, an emeritus professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Fetal tissue is <a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/html5/section_4/4.1.14_human_fetal_tissue_research.htm#:~:text=Human%20fetal%20tissue%20is%20defined,or%20induced%20abortion%20or%20stillbirth.\">defined by the National Institutes of Health</a> as coming from a dead human embryo or fetus after a miscarriage, abortion or stillbirth \u2013 and the use of tissue from an abortion has long been controversial.</p><p>Charo, who wasn't involved in the study, said the new approach doesn\u2019t raise the same ethical issues. \u201cObtaining cells from amniotic fluid that is already being sampled for standard clinical purposes does not appear to add any physical risks to either fetus or pregnant woman,\u201d she said in an email.</p><p>Dr. Arnold Kriegstein, who directs the Developmental and Stem Cell Biology Program at the University of California, San Francisco, and also wasn't involved in the research, said getting cells this way has \u201cthe potential of giving you some information about that individual fetus as it\u2019s growing.\u201d</p><p>And since growing mini-organs from cells in amniotic fluid takes about 4 to 6 weeks, Gerli said, there's enough time for prenatal therapy to fix problems doctors might find.</p><p>To examine one practical use of their approach, the U.K. team worked with colleagues in Belgium to study the development of babies with a condition called a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, in which organs such as the liver and intestines get displaced into the chest because of a hole in the diaphragm. The lungs don\u2019t develop the way they should, and about 30% of fetuses with the condition die. If doctors detect the hernia, they can operate on the fetus while it's still in the womb.</p><p>Researchers grew lung organoids from the cells of fetuses with the condition before and after treatment and compared them to organoids from healthy fetuses. Dr. Paolo de Coppi, an author of the study from University College London and Great Ormond Street Hospital, said they were able to assess the affected child's condition before birth using this method. Doctors are now unable to tell families much about the outcome of a prenatal diagnosis because each case is different, he said. The ability to study functioning prenatal miniorgans, he added, is the first step toward a more detailed prognosis and more effective treatments.</p><p>Kriegstein said more research is needed. \u201cIt\u2019s in the very early stages,\" he added, \"and we\u2019ll have to wait and see how useful it\u2019ll be in the long run.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
