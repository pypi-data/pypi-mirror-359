    "description_summary": "France has become the only country to explicitly guarantee the right to abortion in its constitution and other Europeans wonder whether a rollback of rights like the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision could happen in their countries. Abortion is broadly legal across Europe and governments have been gradually expanding abortion rights, though in some places they are threatened. Women can terminate pregnancies in more than 40 European nations from Portugal to Russia, with varying rules on how late in a pregnancy it is allowed. Abortion is banned or tightly restricted in Poland and a handful of tiny countries.",

For years, abortion was allowed in the case of fetuses with congenital defects. That was struck down in 2020.</p><p>The restrictions have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/poland-abortion-death-sepsis-protests-8b6a8b9451cb7cdfb0325a5c0a67c1d3\">led to deaths,</a> primarily of women later in their pregnancies who wanted to have a child. Women\u2019s rights activists say doctors in Poland now wait for a fetus with no chance of survival to die in the womb rather than perform an abortion. Several women in such cases developed sepsis and died.</p><p>Abortion is a hot topic under the new government. Many of those who elected Donald Tusk\u2019s government want an easing of the law, though there is resistance from conservatives in the coalition; politicians are debating whether it should be settled by a referendum.</p><hl2>BRITAIN</hl2><p>In Britain, abortion was partly legalized by the 1967 Abortion Act, which allows abortions up to 24 weeks of pregnancy if two doctors approve. Later abortions are allowed in some circumstances, including danger to the mother\u2019s life.</p><p>But women who have abortions after 24 weeks in England and Wales can be prosecuted under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. Last year a 45-year-old woman in England was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-england-mother-lockdown-88113627e85c25669669178828871eb0\\\">sentenced to 28 months in prison</a> for ordering abortion pills online to induce a miscarriage when she was 32 to 34 weeks pregnant. After an outcry, her sentence was reduced.</p><p>Lawmakers in Parliament are due to vote this month on whether to remove the relevant section of the 1861 law \u2014 though doctors who assist women ending pregnancies with late abortions could still be charged. Abortion is not as divisive an issue in the U.K. as in the U.S., and the change will likely garner enough cross-party support to pass.</p><hl2>WESTERN BALKANS</hl2><p>The former Communist-run Yugoslavia started expanding abortion rights in the 1950s and inscribed them in the 1974 Constitution, which said: \u201cA person is free to decide on having children. This right can be limited only for the reasons of health protection.\u201d</p><p>After the federation split in bloody wars in the 1990s, its former republics kept old abortion laws, but they are seen as stopping short of what France did Thursday in spelling out the guarantee.</p><p>In Serbia, for example, the 2006 Constitution states that \u201ceveryone has the right to decide on childbirth.\u201d There have been calls for this to be revoked, but only from marginal groups.</p><p>In staunchly Catholic Croatia, influential conservative and religious groups have tried to get abortion banned but with no success. However, many doctors refuse to terminate pregnancies, forcing Croatian women to travel to neighboring countries for the procedure. In 2022, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-zagreb-72c0090333c490f9e81d86f09bd1699a\">Croatia saw protests</a> after a woman was denied an abortion although her baby had health issues.</p><hl2>MALTA</hl2><p>Malta <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/malta-abortion-rights-a5cf505917178cde19adf292ce43ce7c\">eased up on the strictest abortion law</a> in the European Union last year, acting after an American tourist who miscarried had to be airlifted off the Mediterranean island nation to be treated.</p><p>The new Maltese legislation is still strict, saying a woman must be at risk of death to obtain an abortion, and then only after three specialists consent. If the risk of death is imminent, only one doctor\u2019s approval is necessary.</p><p>Until the new legislation, Malta had banned abortion for any reason, with laws making it a crime punishable by up to three years in prison to have the procedure or up to four years to assist a woman in having one.</p><hl2>ITALY AND SAN MARINO</hl2><p>Italy resisted Vatican pressure and guaranteed <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-elections-marriage-italy-808172ad84f4f3d35feef3645633bd06\">access to abortion</a> starting in 1978, allowing women to terminate pregnancies upon request in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, or later if her health or life is endangered.</p><p>The 1978 law allows for medical personnel in the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country to register as conscientious objectors, which in practice often greatly reduces women\u2019s access to the procedure or forces them to travel long distances to obtain one.</p><p>San Marino, a tiny country surrounded by Italy and one of the world\u2019s oldest republics, had been one of the last European states that still criminalized abortion in all circumstances until 2022, when it <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-religion-legislature-f9c2a8aea37ed03272aa994c74f465cc\">legalized the procedure</a> in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.</p><hl2>RUSSIA</hl2><p>Although abortion in Russia is legal and widely available, authorities have been actively seeking to restrict access to it as President Vladimir Putin champions \u201ctraditional values\u201d in an effort to rally people around the flag and boost population growth.</p><p>Women in Russia can terminate a pregnancy until 12 weeks without condition, until 22 weeks in case of rape and at any stage for medical reasons.</p><p>Pressure on abortion rights increased after Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Since 2023, seven Russian regions have passed laws punishing anyone found to \u201ccoerce\u201d women into abortions.</p><p>In a number of regions, and Russian-occupied Crimea, private clinics have refused to perform abortions, pushing women instead to state health care facilities where it takes more time to make an appointment and doctors often pressure women to keep their pregnancies.</p><p>___</p><p>AP journalists Vanessa Gera in Warsaw, Poland, Jill Lawless in London, Nicole Winfield in Rome, Jovana Gec in Belgrade, Serbia, Dasha Litvinova in Tallinn, Estonia, and Katie Marie Davies in Manchester, England, contributed to this report.</p>",

While abortion is a health-related issue, the document primarily addresses legal and political aspects rather than medical or health-specific details. Therefore, it is somewhat relevant to the topic of health but not highly focused on health-related content."
