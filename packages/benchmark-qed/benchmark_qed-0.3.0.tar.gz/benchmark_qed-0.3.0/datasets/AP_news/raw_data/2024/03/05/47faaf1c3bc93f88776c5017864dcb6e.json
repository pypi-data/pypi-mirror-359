The hospital provided the update Monday and said its phone system also is fully functioning. The hospital shut down its own systems for phone, email and medical records once the breach was discovered on Jan. 31. The situation had all the hallmarks of a ransomware attack, although hospital officials have not confirmed or denied the cause. Officials had previously blamed the attack on a \u201cknown criminal threat actor.\u201d",
