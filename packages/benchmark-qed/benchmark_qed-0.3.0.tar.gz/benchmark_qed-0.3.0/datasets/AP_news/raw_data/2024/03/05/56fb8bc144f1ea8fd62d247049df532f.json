Barry Cadden was co-founder of New England Compounding Center in Massachusetts. About 800 patients in 20 states were sickened with fungal meningitis or other infections and about 100 died after receiving injections of mold-tainted steroids, mostly for back pain, in 2012. Eleven died in Michigan. Cadden\u2019s prison sentence will be served at the same time as his current federal sentence for fraud. He'll return to court in April.",

He pleaded no contest to 11 counts of involuntary manslaughter, one charge each for the number of people in Michigan who died, Nessel said.</p><p>Cadden had been awaiting trial on second-degree murder charges before the plea deal. A no-contest plea is treated the same as a guilty plea for sentencing purposes.

His next court hearing is scheduled for March 15.</p><p>Cadden and Chin were charged in Michigan in 2018, though their cases moved slowly because of separate federal prosecutions, appeals and other issues.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Ed White on X, formerly Twitter: @edwritez</p>",
