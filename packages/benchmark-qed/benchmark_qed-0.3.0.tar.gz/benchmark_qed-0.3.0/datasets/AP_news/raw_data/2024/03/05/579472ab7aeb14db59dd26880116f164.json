    "description_summary": "The Nebraska Supreme Court is considering arguments made in a lawsuit challenging a law passed last year that combines a 12-week abortion ban with restrictions on gender-affirming care for those under 19. The lawsuit was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union representing Planned Parenthood. It argues that the hybrid law violates a state constitutional requirement that legislative bills stick to a single subject. The Nebraska Attorney General's Office is defending the law. It argued Tuesday that the law does not violate the single-subject requirement, because both abortion and gender-affirming care would fall under the subject of health care. The high court will make a ruling at a later date.",

But he went further, stating that the case is not one the high court should rule on because it is politically charged and lawmaking is within the sole purview of the Legislature.</p><p>\u201cDidn't that ship sail about 150 years ago?\u201d Chief Justice Mike Heavican retorted.</p><p>Hamilton stood firm, insisting the lawsuit presented a \u201cnonjusticiable political question\u201d and that the Legislature \u201cself-polices\u201d whether legislation holds to the state constitution's single-subject rule.</p><p>\u201cThis court is allowed to review whether another branch has followed the constitutionally established process, isn't it?\" Justice John Freudenberg countered.</p><p>The arguments came in a lawsuit brought last year by the American Civil Liberties Union representing Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, contending that the hybrid law violates the one-subject rule. Lawmakers <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-transgender-ban-nebraska-filibuster-94f1e637e2d9034f608c793bf929e888\">added the abortion ban</a> to an existing bill dealing with gender-related care only after a proposed <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-nebraska-4b23b7c3531b12f303cc0e175239accd\">six-week abortion ban</a> failed to defeat a filibuster.</p><p>The law was the Nebraska Legislature\u2019s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-transgender-ban-nebraska-filibuster-b0b88845d29f1aaadf7936b7304a0507\">most controversial</a> last session, and its gender-affirming care restrictions triggered an <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/filibuster-transgender-gender-affirming-therapy-bill-nebraska-cavanaugh-b9018fd1bf72112ca984ff58679eda6d\">epic filibuster</a> in which a handful of lawmakers sought to block every bill for the duration of the session \u2014 even ones they supported \u2014 in an effort to stymie it.</p><p>A district judge <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-transgender-bill-nebraska-38898fb4b447842aadb9de41e26747c9\">dismissed</a> the lawsuit in August, and the ACLU <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nebraska-abortion-lawsuit-genderaffirming-care-679b8ecb64b4a8862aa0e4a3103896f5\">appealed</a>.</p><p>ACLU attorney Matt Segal argued Tuesday that the abortion segment of the measure and the transgender health care segment dealt with different subjects, included different titles within the legislation and even had different implementation dates. Lawmakers only tacked on the abortion ban to the gender-affirming care bill after the abortion bill had failed to advance on its own, he said.</p><p>Segal's argument seemed based more on the way the Legislature passed the bill than on whether the bill violates the single-subject law, Justice William Cassel remarked.</p><p>But Justice Lindsey Miller-Lerman noted that the high court in 2020 blocked a ballot initiative seeking to legalize medical marijuana after finding it violated the state's single-subject rule. The court found the initiative's provisions to allow people to use marijuana and to produce it were separate subjects.</p><p>If producing medical marijuana and using it are two different topics, how can restricting abortion and transgender health care be the same subject, she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat we've just heard are attempts to shoot the moon,\u201d Segal said in a rebuttal, closing with, \u201cThese are two passing ships in the night, and all they have in common is the sea.\u201d</p><p>The high court will make a ruling on the case at a later date.</p>",
