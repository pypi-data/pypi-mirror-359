But in Alabama, they are among those whose dreams are in limbo after three of the state's largest clinics paused IVF services. That happened in the wake of a state Supreme Court ruling that described frozen embryos as \u201cextrauterine children.\u201d Doctors say the ruling has made an already difficult situation worse for these women. They hope that recent legislative efforts can protect Alabama clinics but worry that threats to IVF may emerge in other states.",

O\u2019Brien and Greenwood are among the many whose dreams are in limbo after <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alabama-frozen-embryos-ruling-ivf-pause-3ea72dd4494cad3f65c57e751e4c5c3b\">three of Alabama\u2019s largest clinics</a> paused IVF services <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alabama-supreme-court-from-embryos-161390f0758b04a7638e2ddea20df7ca\">in the wake of a state Supreme Court</a> ruling that described frozen embryos as \u201cextrauterine children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been hard,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, her voice breaking. \u201cI have no idea what will happen next, and that\u2019s really scary.\u201d</p><p>An estimated 1 in 6 people are affected by infertility worldwide. In the U.S., women increasingly delay motherhood even though fertility gradually declines after age 30, particularly after 35. That raises the need for treatments like IVF. Women 35 to 44 are more than twice as likely as younger women to say they\u2019ve used fertility services, according to a 2023 Pew Research Center survey.</p><p>Besides the growing ranks of older patients, doctors point to a smaller but significant number of women facing treatment for conditions such as cancer, lupus and sickle cell disease who want to preserve their fertility.</p><p>In Alabama, doctors say many of these women are in a holding pattern or seeking help outside the state. Some are also pushing for a legislative solution, and on Tuesday, committees in the state House and Senate advanced <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alabama-ivf-frozen-embryos-legislation-immunity-68d773d6ee89107c9a2e569110e7e31f\">legislation that would shield clinics</a> from prosecution and civil lawsuits. Lawmakers hope to get the measures to the governor this week.</p><p>But some doctors and patients worry they won\u2019t go far enough \u2014 and that legislation or court rulings in other states could eventually put IVF at risk more broadly.</p><p>Dr. Beth Malizia, Greenwood\u2019s doctor at Alabama Fertility, a clinic that paused services, said the upheaval has made life even tougher for women who are already struggling.</p><p>\u201cLook, nobody wants to be in our clinic. \u2026 No one chooses fertility issues. No one chooses cancer. No one chooses recurrent pregnancy loss,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to provide the best care that we can, and this decision has really limited us in our ability to do that. We just want to grow families.\u201d</p><hl2>DREAMS INTERRUPTED</hl2><p>After losing her mother to pancreatic cancer and having no brothers or sisters to turn to, O\u2019Brien realized how important it was for her young daughter \u201cto have a sibling, to navigate life with after we\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>The Birmingham woman and her husband had tried for a baby for a few years, and she suffered through a dangerous, nonviable ectopic pregnancy. She tried various fertility treatments before starting IVF. Ten eggs were retrieved in October, and three were fertilized and frozen. Her doctor transferred one of the embryos into her womb in late January and she became pregnant.</p><p>But the same day the court ruling came down, an ultrasound showed problems with the fetal heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cIt was kind of a double punch \u2014 like, this might not work and you might not have access to IVF,\u201d she said.</p><p>For Greenwood, IVF is the only way she can have children.</p><p>The 31-year-old Montgomery woman was diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma 11 years ago. She went into remission after chemotherapy, but the cancer returned when she was 25. The ensuing radiation, chemotherapy and stem cell transplant led to infertility. So she had her eggs harvested and frozen.</p><p>Being a mom \u201cis something I\u2019ve always dreamed about my whole life,\u201d she said.</p><p>Last year, Greenwood became pregnant with her little girl through an embryo transfer and is now in her third trimester. She doesn\u2019t want to stop at one child, though. \u201cI definitely want at least two, if not more,\u201d she said.</p><p>She\u2019s been trying to stay hopeful that IVF will resume at her clinic. But each day brings fresh reminders of the court decision in her job as a physician assistant in surgical breast oncology, where many of her patients hope to preserve their fertility.</p><hl2>\u2018EVERY MONTH THAT YOU\u2019RE NOT PREGNANT FEELS LIKE GRIEF\u2019</hl2><p>Dr. Kara Goldman, medical director of fertility preservation at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, said older patients and those with serious diseases face different challenges.</p><p>Patients with cancer, for example, urgently need cancer treatment. This means they must begin taking medications to get ready for egg retrieval almost immediately. They can choose to freeze their eggs or fertilize them and freeze embryos \u2014 which have a greater likelihood of surviving the thaw later.</p><p>Older patients face a decreasing likelihood of pregnancy and an increasing chance of chromosomal abnormalities in their offspring the longer they wait. The time it can take to get pregnant often exacts an emotional toll.</p><p>\u201cWhen you are ready to have a child, every month that you\u2019re not pregnant feels like grief,\u201d said Goldman, 41, who had her 9-month-old son through IVF.</p><p>Doctors said the turmoil in Alabama has deepened that grief for many.</p><p>Dr. Mamie McLean, O\u2019Brien\u2019s doctor, said a patient in her 40s who desperately wants a second child had an unsuccessful IVF cycle and wanted to begin the process again this month. She\u2019s considering doing that in Georgia.</p><p>\u201cShe would much prefer to stay in Alabama,\u201d McLean said. \u201cBut she also knows that time isn\u2019t on her side.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Jennifer Kawwass, medical director of the Emory Reproductive Center in Atlanta, said she\u2019s already seeing an influx of Alabama patients, and many are stressed out.</p><p>\u201cFertility treatment already puts patients at so much social and financial stress,\u201d she said. \u201cThe unexpected, sort of indefinite pause on IVF in Alabama is compounding this.\u201d</p><p>Without insurance, one cycle of IVF costs about $15,000 to $25,000. Travel and lodging costs can add thousands more \u2014 especially since an IVF cycle requires six to 10 visits over two weeks.</p><p>As patients consider their options and push for solutions in Alabama, they and their doctors also hope that threats to IVF don\u2019t spread to other states.</p><p>\u201cI would hope that as a country, we can unite over the fact that these treatments are really aiming to help people grow families and bring life into this world,\u201d Kawwass said. \u201cIt is somewhat ironic and also tragic that this is actually hurting individuals that are trying to build their families.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Reporter Kim Chandler contributed to this report from Montgomery, Alabama.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
