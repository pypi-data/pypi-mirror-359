About 2.5 million people in northeast Spain can receive one menstrual cup, one pair of underwear for periods, and two packages of cloth pads at local pharmacies free of charge. Spain\u2019s national government passed a law last year granting women with debilitating menstrual pain the right to paid medical leave. Spain is gearing up for International Women\u2019s Day on March 8 when the European country holds some of the biggest marches for women\u2019s rights in the world.",
