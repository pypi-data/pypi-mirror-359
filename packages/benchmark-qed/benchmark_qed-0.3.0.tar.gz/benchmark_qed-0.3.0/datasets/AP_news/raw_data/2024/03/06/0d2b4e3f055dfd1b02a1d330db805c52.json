Experts say the medications were designed and tested to be taken indefinitely to treat the disease of obesity. Some patients are experimenting with stretching out doses, taking the drugs intermittently or stopping and starting again only if needed. Doctors warn that the symptoms typically roar back even stronger, with more food cravings, hunger and weight regain. There's no data on the long-term effects of intermittent use.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>Millions of Americans who have dropped pounds and boosted their health using popular obesity drugs like Wegovy are facing a new dilemma: What happens if they stop taking them?</p><p>Many worry, rightly, that they\u2019ll regain weight and revert to old habits. In clinical trials, patients who paused the drugs put back on <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35441470/\">most of the weight they lost.</a></p><p>But others are gambling on a do-it-yourself strategy to ease off the drugs and stay slim by stretching out doses, taking the medication intermittently or stopping and starting again only if needed.</p><p>\u201cTo me, it\u2019s a help, it\u2019s an aid,\u201d said Donna Cooper, 62, of Front Royal, Virginia, who lost nearly 40 pounds in nine months using Wegovy along with diet and exercise. \u201cAt some point you have to come off of them. I don\u2019t want to be on them forever.\u201d</p><p>More than 3 million prescriptions for <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mounjaro-ozempic-wegovy-weight-loss-obesity-53d02d95d3e6d4e5e5905a88142a701d\">the new medications</a> are dispensed each month in the U.S., according to recent data from the health technology company IQVIA. They include semaglutide, the drug in Ozempic and Wegovy, and tirzepatide, the drug in Mounjaro and Zepbound.</p><p>But many people don't stick with it. One recent study published in the journal Obesity found that just <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.23952?campaign=wolearlyview\">40% of patients who filled a prescription for Wegovy</a> in 2021 or 2022 were still taking it a year later.</p><p>Doctors who treat obesity stress that the disease is a chronic condition that must be managed indefinitely, like heart disease or high blood pressure. The new injection drugs work by mimicking hormones in the gut and the brain to regulate appetite and feelings of fullness. They were designed \u2014 and tested \u2014 to be taken continuously, experts said.</p><p>\u201cWe are not an injection shop,\u201d said Dr. Andres Acosta, an obesity researcher and medical adviser at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cI don\u2019t think they should be used in intermittent fashion. It\u2019s not approved for that. They don\u2019t work like that.\u201d</p><p>Despite that directive, some patients who achieved their health and weight goals with the drugs are looking for an off-ramp, said Dr. Amy Rothberg, a University of Michigan endocrinologist who directs a weight-management and diabetes treatment program.</p><p>\u201cMany of them want to step down or de-escalate their dose,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re also wanting to ultimately discontinue the medication.\u201d</p><p>TAKING \u2018A BREATHER\u2019</p><p>The reasons for pausing the drugs can vary, said Dr. Katherine Saunders, an obesity expert at Weill Cornell Medicine and co-founder of the obesity treatment company Intellihealth. Some patients don\u2019t like side effects such as nausea and constipation. Others want to stop for holidays or special occasions \u2014 or just because they don\u2019t want to take the weekly shots indefinitely.</p><p>One of Saunders\u2019 patients, a 53-year-old New York man, lost 70 pounds last year using Mounjaro. He told Saunders he wanted to take \u201ca breather\u201d from the medication to see how his body reacted. On her advice, he has been stretching out injections to every 10 days or two weeks, instead of weekly, since December.</p><p>Other patients have been forced to ration or halt doses because the drugs are costly \u2014 $1,000 to $1,300 per month \u2014 and insurance coverage varies or because demand has far outstripped supply, Rothberg noted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s being imposed on them,\u201d she said. \u201cBy necessity they have to go off the medication and kind of figure it out.\u201d</p><p>But hoping the drugs' benefits will last even after stopping them ignores the fundamental biology of obesity, experts said. The disease affects the way the body processes and stores energy, causing it to accumulate weight. The new drugs alter that process and when patients stop, the disease returns, often with a vengeance.</p><p>Many people dropping off the medications report a sharp rise in symptoms of obesity. They include so-called food noise or intrusive thoughts of food; raging hunger; and decreased feelings of fullness when they eat.</p><p>\u201cThese drugs are just a super-suppressor of these native signals,\u201d Rothberg said. \u201cAnd we should expect that\u2019s going to occur.\u201d</p><p>Tara Rothenhoefer, 48, of Trinity, Florida, lost more than 200 pounds after joining a clinical trial for Mounjaro nearly four years ago. She now takes the lowest dose of the drug every four to eight weeks, but she worries when her weight fluctuates by a few pounds.</p><p>\u201cIt scares the daylights out of me to see the numbers on the scale going up,\u201d she said.</p><p>Some patients who stop the drugs and start again find they can\u2019t tolerate the medication, winding up with severe gastrointestinal side effects, Acosta said. Others find the drugs don\u2019t work as well when they restart them, Saunders added. But there's no data on the long-term effects of intermittent use.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a strategy that will work for most individuals, but it could be an option for select patients,\u201d Saunders said.</p><p>Donna Cooper has heard that people gain back weight when they stop the drugs, but she hopes to be an exception. She's on her last box of Wegovy injections. Once she's done, Cooper said she\u2019ll just continue with a strict diet and exercise plan.</p><p>\u201cI just needed a crutch to get everything back in order,\u201d said Cooper, who has gone from a size 16 to a size 10. \u201cAnd I am excited to be done.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
