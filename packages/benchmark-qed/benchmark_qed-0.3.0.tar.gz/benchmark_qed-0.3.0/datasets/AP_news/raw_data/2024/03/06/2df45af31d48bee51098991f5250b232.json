But NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said the key decision-makers who feared those tank cars were going to explode never had all the information they needed. The opinion of the experts at Oxy Vinyls that no dangerous chemical reaction was happening inside the vinyl chloride cars was never relayed to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and the first responders in charge.",

But she said the key decision-makers who feared those tank cars were going to explode three days after the crash never had the information they needed.</p><p>The vinyl chloride released that day, combined with all the other chemicals that spilled and caught fire after the derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, have left residents with <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ohio-train-derailment-contamination-fears-brockovich-fc68b402096a4f5f8598a657f7e399f8\">lingering fears</a> about possible long-term health consequences.</p><p>Experts from the company that made the vinyl chloride inside those tank cars, Oxy Vinyls, were telling contractors hired by Norfolk Southern railroad that they believed that no dangerous chemical reaction was happening, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said. But Oxy Vinyls was left out of the command center.</p><p>\u201cThey informed them that polymerization, they believed polymerization was not occurring, and there was no justification to do a vent and burn,\u201d Homendy said. \u201cThere was another option: let it cool down.\u201d</p><p>However, that information was never relayed to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and the first responders in charge, she said.</p><p>Some of this information came out at <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/norfolk-southern-derailment-east-palestine-ohio-ntsb-bc2531012afcac4ee54e6b3999e31ed9\">NTSB hearings</a> last spring in East Palestine. Homendy's comments Wednesday were the clearest yet that the controversial vent-and-burn action wasn't needed. But the agency won't <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/norfolk-southern-railroad-derailment-east-palestine-cause-bfff4663965d4c94b71482726bd0045a\">release its final report</a> on what caused the Feb. 3, 2023, derailment until it holds another hearing this June.</p><p>DeWine's spokesperson Dan Tierney said it's frustrating to hear now \u2014 more than a year after the derailment \u2014 that it wasn't necessary to blow open those tank cars.</p><p>\u201cThe only two scenarios that were ever brought up were a catastrophic explosion occurring, where shrapnel would be thrust in all directions to a one mile radius or averting that through a controlled vent and burn,\u201d Tierney said. \u201cNobody ever brought up a scenario where if you just did nothing, it wouldn\u2019t explode.\u201d</p><p>East Palestine Fire Chief Keith Drabick has said the consensus in the command center was that releasing and burning the chemicals was the \u201cleast bad option.\u201d</p><p>But Homendy said they never heard Oxy Vinyls' opinion that the vinyl chloride was stable. Instead, the decision-makers relied on contractors who were alarmed by the limited temperature readings they were able to get, combined with the violent way one of the tank cars released vinyl chloride with a roar from a pressure release valve after hours of calm. Drew McCarty with Specialized Professional Services testified last spring that the tank car \u201cfrankly scared the hell out of us.\u201d</p><p>Republican Sen. JD Vance, who questioned Homendy at Wednesday's hearing, said he wasn't trying to criticize Drabick, DeWine and the other officials who made the decision.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a criticism of the people on the ground who provided inadequate information \u2014 and provided inadequate information, I think, to the great detriment of the community on the ground,\" Vance said. \"This is extraordinary work by your team, but this is a really, really troubling set of circumstances.\u201d</p><p>Norfolk Southern defended the decision again Wednesday and said the plan had nothing to do with trying to get the trains moving again more quickly.</p><p>\u201cThe top priority of everyone involved was the safety of the community, as well as limiting the impact of the incident,\" the railroad said. \"The successful controlled release prevented a potentially catastrophic uncontrolled explosion.\u201d</p><p>Krissy Ferguson, 49, has not been able to return to her home that sits on top of one of the creeks that was contaminated since the derailment. She said she was heartbroken to hear the latest updates from the NTSB.</p><p>\u201cIs our government going to allow a corporation to get away with it or are they going to act on it? Or is it going to be swept down the polluted creek like everything else is?\u201d Ferguson said.</p><p>Misti Allison, who lives with her family about a mile away from the derailment site, said the findings reaffirm what she believed to be true all along: that the vent and burn did not need to happen.</p><p>\u201cThe only justification was greed, and that Norfolk Southern was putting profits over people to get the train tracks up and running as fast as possible and to destroy whatever evidence was left,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>And most questions about the potential long-term health effects remain unanswered.</p><p>\u201cWe need to make sure that health care is available to everybody, not just those who want to participate in a study,\u201d she said.</p><p>The NTSB has said that it appears an overheating bearing on one of the railcars caused the derailment. Several trackside detectors spotted the bearing starting to heat up for miles beforehand, but the temperature didn't reach a high enough level to trigger an alarm until right before the crash. That meant the crew didn't have an opportunity to stop the train.</p><p>Many <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/norfolk-southern-train-derailment-east-palestine-ohio-eab23ed0fd6577a5cf96e8fd301da681\">residents of East Palestine</a> are eager to move forward once the cleanup of the derailment wraps up later this year, but some are still experiencing respiratory problems, rashes and other health concerns.</p><p>Norfolk Southern has said that its response to the disaster and the aid it has offered the town has cost it more than <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/norfolk-southern-fourth-quarter-profit-derailment-ohio-9e6d48eac14f7bed075a6ae5c096f2fe\">$1.1 billion.</a> Now an <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/norfolk-southern-proxy-fight-railroad-ancora-takeover-b89c365bc8da4d5c074e15f15ce67c20\">investor group</a> that's critical of the railroad's response and the disappointing profits it has reported over the past several years is pushing to fire <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/norfolk-southern-derailment-east-palestine-73d273f88147b30ea53caf3d2b23f669\">CEO Alan Shaw</a> and take control of the railroad.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Patrick Orsagos contributed to this report from Columbus, Ohio.</p>",
