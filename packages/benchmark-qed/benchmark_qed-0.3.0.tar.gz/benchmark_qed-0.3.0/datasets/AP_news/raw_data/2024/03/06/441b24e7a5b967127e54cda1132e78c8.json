One piece of the package would let the state buy medical debt using federal COVID-19 dollars. Under the proposal, the state could purchase the debt for pennies on the dollar using American Rescue Plan Act funds and then eliminate the debt for eligible Rhode Island residents. The legislation would also require hospitals to screen uninsured patients to see if they\u2019re eligible for Medicaid or Medicare and prohibit debt collectors from reporting medical debt to credit bureaus.",
