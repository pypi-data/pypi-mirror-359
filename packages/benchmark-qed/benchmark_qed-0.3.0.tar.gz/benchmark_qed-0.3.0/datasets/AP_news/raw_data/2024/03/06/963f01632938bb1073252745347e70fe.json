It\u2019s not a blip on the life radar \u2014 it\u2019s a significant chunk of time. While your parents may have retired and never worked another day in their lives, you may find that part-time work when you get older fulfills your mental needs and helps your retirement savings last. You may have to be more aggressive with your investments than you expected. And staying healthy is more important than ever. From adapting your portfolio to playing more pickleball, here are the ways retirement might be shaping up for you.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>Now that retirement spans more years than ever, you might need to rethink how you\u2019re envisioning that stage of your life. Although Americans are retiring a little later than they did 30 years ago, they\u2019re also living longer. Retirement isn\u2019t a blip on the life radar \u2014 it\u2019s a significant chunk of time.</p><p>While your parents may have retired and never worked another day in their lives, you may find that <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/medicare/working-past-65?utm_campaign=ct_prod&utm_source=ap&utm_medium=mpsyn\">part-time work when you get older</a> fulfills your mental needs and helps your retirement savings last. You may have to be more aggressive with your investments than you expected. And staying healthy is crucial.</p><p>\u201cThe questions I\u2019m being asked are different, and the conversations clients are bringing to me are different,\u201d says John McGlothlin III, a certified financial planner in Austin, Texas.</p><p>Here are the ways retirement might be shaping up for you.</p><p>YOU\u2019LL KEEP MORE MONEY IN STOCKS</p><p>People used to enter retirement with a conservative-leaning portfolio that held a solid chunk in bonds and cash alternatives. Although advisers aren\u2019t suggesting clients throw caution to the wind, they\u2019re tweaking the investing plan at this life stage.</p><p>\u201cWe may just stay a little more aggressive, because the day you retire, you don\u2019t need all this money,\u201d says Jonathan Swanburg, a CFP in Houston. \u201cSome of this money is for 30 years from now, some of it is for your kids and grandkids because you\u2019re never going to touch it.\u201d</p><p>McGlothlin encourages his clients to exit target date funds at retirement because he thinks they get too conservative. \u201cThe moment you hit that retirement date, they all of a sudden go to 50% bonds, and within a few years you\u2019re at 60% and 70% bonds,\u201d he says. \u201cWhile bond yields are much better than they were a few years ago, I don\u2019t necessarily think I can get clients 20 to 30 years of sustainable withdrawals if I\u2019m that bond heavy.\u201d</p><p>YOU MAY CHOOSE TO KEEP WORKING</p><p>The number of adults age 65 and older who are working is almost twice the number who were working 35 years ago, according to a <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/12/14/older-workers-are-growing-in-number-and-earning-higher-wages/\">2023 Pew Research report</a>. Consulting or part-time work in retirement allows you to withdraw less from your savings and potentially delay taking Social Security, and your investments have more time to grow.</p><p>\u201cIt gives us flexibility in our asset spend-down picture,\u201d says Catherine Valega, a CFP in Winchester, Massachusetts. \u201cThe thought of moving to no more income coming in \u2014 that\u2019s really stress provoking.\u201d</p><p>Valega also encourages clients to pursue work and other activities so they don\u2019t go stir-crazy. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have 10 hours in the day that you didn\u2019t have before,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can exercise, and that\u2019s great and you should, but beyond that you need some amount of mental stimulation.\u201d</p><p>YOU MAY WANT TO SAVE FOR IN-HOME CARE</p><p>Most adults age 55 and older want to age in place, according to a 2023 survey from the McKinsey Health Institute. Eighty percent wish to live in their own home, and 71% of older adults who aren\u2019t living in their own home wish they could.</p><p>With home health aides having a national median cost of $27 an hour, according to <a href=\"https://www.genworth.com/aging-and-you/finances/cost-of-care/cost-of-care-trends-and-insights.html/\">Genworth\u2019s 2021 Cost of Care data</a>, planning for in-home care may require working longer to build the nest egg to pay for it, or even relocating to a city where home services are cheaper. Renovations to make a home more accessible or single-story livable are also helpful.</p><p>\u201cI think the generation that\u2019s retiring right now, they\u2019ve seen their parents or their family members go into nursing facilities or assisted living facilities and are pretty much unanimously like, \u2018I really don\u2019t want that,\u2019\u201d McGlothlin says.</p><p>YOU\u2019LL (REALLY) WANT TO STAY HEALTHY</p><p>The average 35-year-old woman today can expect to live to about age 81 \u2014 which means many will live even longer. David Foster, a CFP in St. Louis, now includes articles related to physical fitness and health alongside financial tidbits in his email newsletters to clients.</p><p>\u201cThat probably just wouldn\u2019t have been on top of people\u2019s minds 30 or 40 years ago because they weren\u2019t likely to live until they were 90,\u201d Foster says. \u201cExercise is good for avoiding cognitive decline and helping with your heart.\u201d</p><p>Although it may feel a long way off, safeguarding your health now can lower medical costs later, plus help ensure you can work (and play) as long as you\u2019re able. That means exercising regularly, eating reasonably healthy foods and getting enough sleep, among other things.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do anything else if you don\u2019t have your health,\u201d Foster says.</p><p>This column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.
