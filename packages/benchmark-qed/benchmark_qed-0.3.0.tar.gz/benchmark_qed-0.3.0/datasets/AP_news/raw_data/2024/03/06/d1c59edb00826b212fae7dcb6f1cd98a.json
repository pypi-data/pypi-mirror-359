The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a safety alert on Wednesday about the products. They include cinnamon sold at the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores, among others. The cinnamon contains lead at levels that could be unsafe for people, particularly children, with prolonged exposure to the spice. Consumers should not buy the products and should throw away any containers they have at home. FDA officials launched what they called a \u201ctargeted survey\u201d of cinnamon products after a recall of lead-tainted cinnamon applesauce pouches sickened nearly 500 children.",
