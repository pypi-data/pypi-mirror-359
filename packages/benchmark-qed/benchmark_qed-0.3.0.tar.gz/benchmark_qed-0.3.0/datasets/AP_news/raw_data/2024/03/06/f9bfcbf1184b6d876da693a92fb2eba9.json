For the first time, millions of people in this country felt seen for the very first time.\u201d</p><p>The stamp will be available starting April 5, and a dedication ceremony for the stamp will take place at Eisenhower Health in Rancho Mirage, California.</p><p>She is the seventh first lady to be honored with a U.S. postage stamp.</p>",
