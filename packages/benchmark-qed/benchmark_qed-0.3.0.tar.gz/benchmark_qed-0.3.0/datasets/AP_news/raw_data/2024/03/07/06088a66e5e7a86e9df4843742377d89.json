Darker mornings and more evening sun together knock out of whack a body clock that regulates when we're drowsy and when we're alert. Studies even show an uptick in heart attacks and strokes the first few days after the spring time change. Getting more morning light can help reset your circadian rhythm and get sleep that's vital for good health.",

It also could harm your health.</p><p>Darker mornings and more evening light together knock your body clock out of whack \u2014 which means daylight saving time can usher in sleep trouble for weeks or longer. Studies have even found an uptick in heart attacks and strokes right after the March time change.</p><p>There are ways to ease the adjustment, including getting more sunshine to help reset your circadian rhythm for healthful sleep.</p><p>\u201cNot unlike when one travels across many time zones, how long it can take is very different for different people,\u201d said Dr. Eduardo Sanchez of the American Heart Association. \u201cUnderstand that your body is transitioning.\u201d</p><hl2>When does daylight saving time start?</hl2><p>Daylight saving time begins Sunday at 2 a.m., an hour of sleep vanishing in most of the U.S. The ritual will reverse on Nov. 3 when clocks \u201cfall back\u201d as daylight saving time ends.</p><p>Hawaii and most of Arizona don\u2019t make the spring switch, sticking to standard time year-round along with Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Worldwide, dozens of countries also observe daylight saving time, starting and ending at different dates.</p><p>Some people try to prepare for daylight saving time\u2019s sleep jolt by going to bed a little earlier two or three nights ahead. With a third of American adults already not getting the recommended seven hours of nightly shuteye, catching up can be difficult.</p><hl2>What happens to your brain when it's lighter later?</hl2><p>The brain has a master clock that is set by exposure to sunlight and darkness. This circadian rhythm is a roughly 24-hour cycle that determines when we become sleepy and when we\u2019re more alert. The patterns change with age, one reason that early-to-rise youngsters evolve into hard-to-wake teens.</p><p>Morning light resets the rhythm. By evening, levels of a hormone called melatonin begin to surge, triggering drowsiness. Too much light in the evening \u2014 that extra hour from daylight saving time \u2014 delays that surge and the cycle gets out of sync.</p><p>Sleep deprivation is linked to heart disease, cognitive decline, obesity and numerous other problems. And that circadian clock affects more than sleep, also influencing things like heart rate, blood pressure, stress hormones and metabolism.</p><hl2>How does the time change affect your health?</hl2><p>Fatal car crashes temporarily jump the first few days after the spring time change, according to a study of U.S. traffic fatalities. The risk was highest in the morning, and researchers attributed it to sleep deprivation.</p><p>Then there\u2019s the cardiac connection. The American Heart Association points to studies that suggest an uptick in heart attacks on the Monday after daylight saving time begins, and in strokes for two days afterward.</p><p>Doctors already know that heart attacks, especially severe ones, are a bit more common on Mondays generally \u2014 and in the morning, when blood is more clot-prone.</p><p>It\u2019s not clear why the time change would add to the Monday connection, Sanchez said, although probably something about the abrupt circadian disruption exacerbates factors such as high blood pressure in people already at risk.</p><hl2>How to prepare for daylight saving time</hl2><p>Go to bed a little earlier Friday and Saturday nights, and try to get more morning light. Moving up daily routines, like dinner time or when you exercise, also may help cue your body to start adapting, sleep experts advise.</p><p>Afternoon naps and caffeine as well as evening light from phones and other electronic devices can make adjusting to an earlier bedtime even harder.</p><p>Stay tuned: Some health groups, including the American Medical Association and American Academy of Sleep Medicine, have said it's time to do away with time switches and that sticking with standard time year-round aligns better with the sun \u2014 and human biology.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
