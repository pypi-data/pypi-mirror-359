That's according to White House officials who spoke to The Associated Press ahead of the speech. The unity pitch will come under one broad umbrella theme \u2014 that Biden is a president for all Americans. It's an implicit nod to moderate Republicans and swing voters who the president hopes will find a home in his political coalition.",

This is being done years ahead of schedule, one White House official said. The officials were granted anonymity to discuss policy details ahead of a formal White House announcement.</p><p>Another is an announcement from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, known as ARPA-H, of a clinical program that will focus on addressing late-stage cancers for which doctors often struggle to find treatment. One White House official described it as a data-driven initiative that would allow doctors to track and treat patients in real time with more success.</p><p>Some of the unity agenda issues are deeply personal to Biden, including veterans care and advancements in cancer care. They also fit Biden\u2019s belief that voters want to see bipartisanship and cooperation from politicians, and reflect the issues that are most often raised by the Americans he meets with as he travels the country, officials said. Though tales of gridlock can dominate headlines, the White House points to more than 400 bipartisan bills Biden has signed into law that underpin his unity agenda.</p>",
