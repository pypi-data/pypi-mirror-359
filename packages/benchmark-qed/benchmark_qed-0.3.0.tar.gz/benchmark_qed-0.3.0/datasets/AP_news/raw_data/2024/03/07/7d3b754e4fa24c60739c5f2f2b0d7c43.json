The legislation passed by the House on Thursday and awaiting Senate action would outline penalties for causing death or serious injury to an unborn person. Democrats expressed concerns over the bill, citing the majority ruling of Alabama\u2019s Supreme Court treating an embryo the same as a child or gestating fetus under that state\u2019s wrongful death law. The Iowa legislation would require Senate passage and Gov. Kim Reynolds' signature before before becoming law.",

Kim Reynolds to become law.</p><p>Referencing Alabama\u2019s case, a Democrat in Iowa\u2019s House proposed, but ultimately withdrew, an amendment to explicitly carve out protections for IVF, a procedure that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ivf-alabama-over-35-cancer-lupus-sickle-cell-8a6e653c79511fc39bbb7c2267941e7a\">helps some women</a> become pregnant.</p><p>\u201cThis bill right here \u2026 puts IVF at risk whether you want to believe it or not,\u201d said Iowa Democrat Rep. Beth Wessel-Kroeschell. \u201cWe are now seeing the damage these laws can have on people seeking and providing reproductive health care.\u201d</p><p>The majority ruling of Alabama\u2019s Supreme Court treats an embryo the same as a child or gestating fetus under the state\u2019s wrongful death law, explicitly stating \u201cunborn children are \u2018children.'\u201d That led three major providers of IVF in Alabama to pause services because of concerns about liabilities.</p><p>Iowa Republican Rep. Skyler Wheeler said the bill is far more simple and that Democratic lawmakers are \u201ctrying to turn this into a conversation that it is not.\u201d</p><p>The Alabama case, Wheeler said, pertains to that state\u2019s laws and courts, not Iowa\u2019s, and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alabama-ivf-frozen-embryos-ruling-cab8171e80c88a088778dc7a187b7b5a\">elected officials</a> there have already <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alabama-ivf-clinic-lawsuit-immunity-things-know-0d16d3be139f42c96bc3ab35c4467f55\">moved to clarify</a> that IVF providers are protected from liability related to the destruction of or damage to an embryo.</p><p>Wessel-Kroeschell said that exception is not well-defined in Iowa's law, nor is it clear how Iowa or federal courts might interpret the new language, which she said enshrines \u201cthe myth of fetal personhood in our state code.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe simply cannot know how far this reasoning will be taken,\u201d she said.</p><p>Earlier in the afternoon, House Republicans withdrew a bill that would require a father to pay child support starting at fertilization after Democrats pressed on the potential implications, including the possibility of a court order for risky paternity testing of a fetus.</p>",

While the primary focus is on legal and political aspects, the topic intersects significantly with health, particularly reproductive health and IVF. The document addresses concerns about how the bill might affect IVF providers and patients, which is directly related to health. However, the primary focus is not exclusively on health but also on legal and political dimensions."
