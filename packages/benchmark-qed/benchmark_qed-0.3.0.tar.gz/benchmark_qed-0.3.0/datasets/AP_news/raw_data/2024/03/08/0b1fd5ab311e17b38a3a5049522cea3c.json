Boston University researchers who analyzed a sample of Robert Card\u2019s brain tissue say they found evidence of traumatic brain injury, including degeneration in the nerve fibers allowing communication between different brain areas. Card is believed to have been exposed to repeated low-level blasts as an Army hand grenade instructor. It is unknown if that caused his brain injury and what role brain injury played in his declining mental health. An Army spokesperson calls the lab findings \u201cconcerning\u201d and described new efforts to protect other soldiers from blast injuries.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Brain injury experts are cautioning against drawing conclusions from newly released and limited information about <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/maine-shooting-lewiston-victims-commission-5ff6d30d8c3f445e8a5431d509cfc936\">evidence of a brain injury</a> in an Army reservist who killed 18 people last year in Maine\u2019s deadliest mass shooting.</p><p>Boston University researchers who analyzed a sample of Robert Card\u2019s brain tissue said Wednesday they found evidence of traumatic brain injury. The analysis, requested by the Maine medical examiner, found degeneration in the nerve fibers allowing communication between different areas of the brain, inflammation and small blood vessel injury, according to Dr. Ann McKee of the university\u2019s Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center.</p><p>Card had been an instructor at an Army hand grenade training range, where it is believed he was exposed to repeated low-level blasts. It is unknown if that caused Card\u2019s brain injury and what role the injury may have played in his <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/lewiston-maine-shooting-warning-signs-robert-card-e154aac79b4f9d42a5381c20cd6618dd\">declining mental health</a> before he opened fire at <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/maine-shooting-witnesses-terror-ebd05706f059bbe482bff6797604df93\">a bowling alley and bar in Lewiston</a> on Oct. 25.</p><p>McKee made no connection between the injury and Card\u2019s violent actions.</p><p>\u201cWhile I cannot say with certainty that these pathological findings underlie Mr. Card\u2019s behavioral changes in the last 10 months of life, based on our previous work, brain injury likely played a role in his symptoms,\u201d McKee said in a statement released by the Card family.</p><p>Dr. Alexandra Filippakis, a neurologist who has treated members of the military and others for traumatic brain injuries, said Thursday she would not conclude brain injury played a role in Card\u2019s behavior based on McKee\u2019s description of her findings.</p><p>\u201cTBI is a very broad diagnosis, and it looks different in different people. Not everybody has the same symptoms. Not everybody has the same severity of symptoms,\u201d Filippakis said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that you could, with certainty, link that to a particular action.\u201d</p><p>Filippakis, who works at Wentworth-Douglass Hospital in Dover, New Hampshire, said the connectivity damage McKee described is common and can have many causes, including aging, high blood pressure and smoking.</p><p>\u201cThat could mean so many different things,\u201d she said. \u201cYou certainly can\u2019t draw any conclusions from that piece of information.\u201d</p><p>But James Stone, a University of Virginia radiologist who has studied repeated low-level blast exposure in the military, said changes to Card\u2019s brain \u201cseemed pretty profound.\u201d</p><p>Such injuries can affect impulse control and emotional regulation, he said, and though he doesn\u2019t know if those parts of Card\u2019s brain were affected, \u201cit\u2019s certainly hard to imagine that the level of brain changes that we\u2019re seeing in some way did not contribute to his behavior.\u201d</p><p>Chris Dulla, a professor and interim chair of neuroscience at Tufts School of Medicine, said he was surprised that researchers found no evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nfl-football-super-bowl-football-sports-joe-namath-f24de31db5c743f29d1a5c280aa72037\">plagued many professional football players</a>.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to be as cut and dry,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat that speaks to is how varied traumatic brain injuries are, and how difficult they can be to diagnose, even in the postmortem brain sample, when you can study every detail.\u201d</p><p>The findings highlight the connection between brain injuries and underlying psychological conditions, Dulla said.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re already struggling with some kind of psychiatric condition or at risk for some kind of psychiatric problem, brain injuries might be something that can kind of push you over the edge and have that change really come front and center when it might have been sort of a minor underlying thing before,\u201d he said.</p><p>Experts say traumatic brain injury can lead to headaches, mood changes, memory loss and sleep issues. Stone said his research has shown repeated exposure to even low-level blasts can result in changes to the brain. The Department of Defense has been \u201cvery engaged\u201d in studying the issue, Stone said, and a panel on which he serves is expected to release new guidelines in May for both the U.S. military and NATO allies.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been very proactive about this,\u201d he said.</p><p>An Army spokesperson on Thursday called the lab findings regarding Card \u201cconcerning\u201d and said they \u201cunderscore the Army\u2019s need to do all it can to protect Soldiers against blast-induced injury.\u201d</p><p>In addition to updating the guidance on risk mitigation, the Army plans to launch a public safety campaign and will begin requiring documentation of training environments and tracking of exposed personnel.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/lewiston-maine-shooting-warning-signs-robert-card-e154aac79b4f9d42a5381c20cd6618dd\">Sean Hodgson</a>, Card\u2019s close friend and a fellow reservist, said Thursday that safety was a top priority at their training range and the blast exercises were well controlled.</p><p>\u201cYou feel it through you, but it\u2019s mild,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIn my opinion it\u2019s one of the safest ranges to be on,\" Hodgson said. \"I never heard him complain about the blasts.\u201d</p><p>Six weeks before the shooting, Hodgson texted an Army supervisor about his growing concerns about Card, saying, \u201cI believe he\u2019s going to snap and do a mass shooting.\u201d</p><p>That Sept. 15 message came months after relatives warned police that Card had grown paranoid and said they were concerned about his access to guns.</p><p>Card was hospitalized in a psychiatric unit for two weeks in July after shoving a fellow reservist and locking himself in a motel room.

It includes expert opinions on traumatic brain injury (TBI), its symptoms, and its effects on mental health. While the primary focus is on a specific incident of violence, the document provides substantial information on health-related topics such as brain injuries, their diagnosis, and their impact on behavior. This makes it somewhat relevant to the topic of health, though the context is specific to a criminal case rather than general health information."
