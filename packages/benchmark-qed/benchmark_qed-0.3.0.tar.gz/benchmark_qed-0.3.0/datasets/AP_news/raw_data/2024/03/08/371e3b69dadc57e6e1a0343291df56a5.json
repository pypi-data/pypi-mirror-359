He delivered his homily and heard confessions on Friday after a lingering bout of the flu sent him to the hospital for tests and forced him to cancel some appointments. Francis read his homily aloud in a strong voice with some occasional coughs. Previously, he asked an aide to deliver his remarks to spare him the strain. He is still having mobility problems and used a wheelchair rather than walk with a cane, even for a short distance.",
