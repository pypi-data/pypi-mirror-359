    "description_summary": "Federal regulators are putting off a decision on Eli Lilly\u2019s potential Alzheimer\u2019s treatment with an unusual request to have an advisory committee examine the drug. Lilly expected a decision on donanemab in this year\u2019s first quarter, which ends this month. But the drugmaker said Friday that the Food and Drug Administration wants more information about donanemab\u2019s safety and effectiveness. No date has been set for the advisory committee meeting. The FDA often asks committees to review drugs that are first in their class of treatments. Donanemab, if approved, would follow Eisai\u2019s Leqembi, which was approved last year, and Biogen\u2019s Aduhelm.",

Executive Vice President Anne White said in a statement that the Indianapolis-based company remains confident in donanemab\u2019s potential and will work with the FDA.</p><p>The company said the agency wants to learn more from a pivotal study Lilly conducted on the drug.</p><p>The 18-month, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alzheimers-drug-lilly-amyloid-donanemab-1a031c94e3bdf05051377e848c3f730b\">late-stage study</a> showed that patients taking donanemab declined about 22% more slowly in terms of memory and cognitive ability than those who received a dummy infusion. The delay amounted to about four to seven months.</p><p>In the study, patients were taken off the drug once their brain plaque reached low levels. Most patients reached that point within a year.</p><p>Donanemab is only the second drug that has been convincingly shown to delay the inevitable cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s.

The IV drugs target one of Alzheimer\u2019s culprits, sticky amyloid plaque buildup in the brain.</p><p>Donanemab, like Leqembi, comes with serious side effects that include brain swelling and bleeding. Those are common to all plaque-targeting drugs and require close monitoring.</p><p>About a quarter of donanemab recipients showed evidence of that swelling, and about 20% had microbleeds.</p><p>___</p><p>Perrone reported from Washington, D.C.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
