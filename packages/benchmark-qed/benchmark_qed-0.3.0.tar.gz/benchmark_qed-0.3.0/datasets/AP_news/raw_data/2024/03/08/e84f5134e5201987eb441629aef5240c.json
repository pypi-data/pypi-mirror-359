It includes interactions with the audience and White House corrections to Biden\u2019s remarks in brackets:</p><p>Good evening. Good evening. If I were smart, I\u2019d go home now.</p><p>Mr. Speaker, Madam Vice President, members of Congress, my fellow Americans.</p><p>In January 1941, Franklin Roosevelt came to this chamber to speak to the nation. And he said, \u201cI address you at a moment unprecedented in the history of the Union\u201d. Hitler was on the march. War was raging in Europe.</p><p>President Roosevelt\u2019s purpose was to wake up Congress and alert the American people that this was no ordinary time. Freedom and democracy were under assault in the world.</p><p>Tonight, I come to the same chamber to address the nation. Now it\u2019s we who face an unprecedented moment in the history of the Union.</p><p>And, yes, my purpose tonight is to wake up the Congress and alert the American people that this is no ordinary moment either. Not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault at home as they are today.</p><p>What makes our moment rare is that freedom and democracy are under attack at \u2014 both at home and overseas at the very same time.</p><p>Overseas, Putin of Russia is on the march, invading Ukraine and sowing chaos throughout Europe and beyond.</p><p>If anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I assure you: He will not.</p><p>But Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine can stop Putin. Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons that it needs to defend itself.</p><p>That is all \u2014 that is all Ukraine is asking. They\u2019re not asking for American soldiers. In fact, there are no American soldiers at war in Ukraine, and I\u2019m determined to keep it that way.</p><p>But now assistance to Ukraine is being blocked by those who want to walk away from our world leadership.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long ago when a Republican president named Ronald Reagan thundered, \u201cMr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\u201d</p><p>Now \u2014 now my predecessor, a former Republican president, tells Putin, quote, \u201cDo whatever the hell you want.\u201d</p><p>AUDIENCE: Booo \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s a quote.</p><p>A former president actually said that \u2014 bowing down to a Russian leader. I think it\u2019s outrageous, it\u2019s dangerous, and it\u2019s unacceptable.</p><p>America is a founding member of NATO, the military alliance of democratic nations created after World War Two prevent \u2014 to prevent war and keep the peace.</p><p>And today, we\u2019ve made NATO stronger than ever. We welcomed Finland to the Alliance last year. And just this morning, Sweden officially joined, and their minister is here tonight. Stand up. Welcome. Welcome, welcome, welcome. And they know how to fight.</p><p>Mr. Prime Minister, welcome to NATO, the strongest military alliance the world has ever seen.</p><p>I say this to Congress: We have to stand up to Putin. Send me a bipartisan national security bill. History is literally watching. History is watching.</p><p>If the United States walks away, it will put Ukraine at risk. Europe is at risk. The free world will be at risk, emboldening others to do what they wish to do us harm.</p><p>My message to President Putin, who I\u2019ve known for a long time, is simple: We will not walk away. We will not bow down. I will not bow down.</p><p>In a literal sense, history is watching. History is watching \u2014 just like history watched three years ago on January 6th when insurrectionists stormed this very Capitol and placed a dagger to the throat of American democracy.</p><p>Many of you were here on that darkest of days. We all saw with our own eyes the insurrectionists were not patriots. They had come to stop the peaceful transfer of power, to overturn the will of the people.</p><p>January 6th lies about the 2020 election and the plots to steal the election posed a great \u2014 gravest threat to U.S. democracy since the Civil War.</p><p>But they failed. America stood \u2014 America stood strong and democracy prevailed. We must be honest: The threat to democracy must be defended (defeated).</p><p>My predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth about January 6th. I will not do that.</p><p>This is a moment to speak the truth and to bury the lies. Here\u2019s the simple truth: You can\u2019t love your country only when you win.</p><p>As I\u2019ve done ever since being elected to office, I ask all of you, without regard to party, to join together and defend democracy. Remember your oath of office to defend against all threats foreign and domestic.</p><p>Respect \u2014 respect free and fair elections, restore trust in our institutions, and make clear political violence has absolutely no place \u2014 no place in America. Zero place.</p><p>Again, it\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s not hyperbole to suggest history is watching. They\u2019re watching. Your children and grandchildren will read about this day and what we do.</p><p>History is watching another assault on freedom. Joining us tolight (tonight) is Latorya Beasley, a social worker from Birmingham, Alabama.</p><p>Fourteen months ago \u2014 fourteen months ago, she and her husband welcomed a baby girl thanks to the miracle of IVF. She scheduled treatments to have that second child, but the Alabama Supreme Court shut down IVF treatments across the state, unleashed by a Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. She was told her dream would have to wait.</p><p>What her family had gone through should never have happened. Unless Congress acts, it could happen again.</p><p>So, tonight, let\u2019s stand up for families like hers. To my friends across the aisle \u2014 don\u2019t keep this waiting any longer. Guarantee the right to IVF. Guarantee it nationwide.</p><p>Like most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right.</p><p>I thank Vice President Harris for being an incredible leader defending reproductive freedom and so much more. Thank you.</p><p>My predecessor came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned. He\u2019s the reason it was overturned, and he brags about it. Look at the chaos that has resulted.</p><p>Joining us tonight is Kate Cox, a wife and mother from Dallas. She\u2019d become pregnant again and had a fetus with a fatal condition. Her doctor told Kate that her own life and her ability to have future in the fil- \u2014 children in the future were at risk if she didn\u2019t act. Because Texas law banned her ability to act, Kate and her husband had to leave the state to get what she needed.</p><p>What her family had gone through should have never happened as well. But it\u2019s happening to too many others.</p><p>There are state laws banning the freedom to choose, criminalizing doctors, forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their states to get the treatment they need.</p><p>Many of you in this chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive freedom.</p><p>AUDIENCE: Booo \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: My God, what freedom else would you take away?</p><p>Look, its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court majority wrote the following \u2014 and with all due respect, Justices \u2014 \u201cWomen are not without electoral \u2014 electoral power\u201d \u2014 excuse me \u2014 \u201celectoral or political power.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re about to realize just how much you were right about that.</p><p>Clearly \u2014 clearly, those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women.</p><p>But they found out. When reproductive freedom was on the ballot, we won in 2022 and 2023. And we\u2019ll win again in 2024.</p><p>If you \u2014 if you, the American people, send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again.</p><p>Folks, America cannot go back.</p><p>I am here to- \u2014 tonight to show what I believe is the way forward, because I know how far we\u2019ve come.</p><p>Four years ago next week, before I came to office, the country was hit by the worst pandemic and the worst economic crisis in a century.</p><p>Remember the fear, record losses?</p><p>Remember the spikes in crime and the murder rate? A raging virus that took more than 1 million American lives of loved ones, millions left behind.</p><p>A mental health crisis of isolation and loneliness.</p><p>A president, my predecessor, failed in the most basic presidential duty that he owes to American people: the duty to care.</p><p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: Lies!</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I think that\u2019s unforgivable.</p><p>I came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in the nation\u2019s history. We have.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t make new, but in a \u2014 news \u2014 in a thousand cities and towns, the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told.</p><p>So, let\u2019s tell the story here \u2014 tell it here and now.</p><p>America\u2019s comeback is building a future of American possibilities; building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down; investing in all of America, in all Americans to make every- \u2014 sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one \u2014 no one behind.</p><p>The pandemic no longer controls our lives. The vaccine that saved us from COVID is \u2014 are now being used to beat cancer.</p><p>Turning setback into comeback. That\u2019s what America does. That\u2019s what America does.</p><p>Folks, I inherited an economy that was on the brink. Now, our economy is literally the envy of the world.</p><p>Fifteen million new jobs in just three years. A record. A record.</p><p>Unemployment at 50-year lows.</p><p>A record 16 million Americans are starting small businesses, and each one is a literal act of hope, with historic job growth and small-business growth for Black and Hispanics and Asian Americans. Eight hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs in America and counting.</p><p>Where is it written we can\u2019t be the manufacturing capital of the world? We are and we will.</p><p>More people have health insurance today \u2014 more people have health insurance today than ever before.</p><p>The racial wealth gap is the smallest it\u2019s been in 20 years.</p><p>Wages keep going up. Inflation keeps coming down. Inflation has dropped from 9 percent to 3 percent \u2014 the lowest in the world and tending (trending) lower.</p><p>The landing is and will be soft. And now, instead of aporting \u2014 importing foreign products and exporting American jobs, we\u2019re exporting American products and creating American jobs right here in America, where they belong.</p><p>And it takes time, but the American people are beginning to feel it. Consumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring.</p><p>\u201cBuy America\u201d has been the law of the land since the 1930s. Past administrations, including my predecessor \u2014 including some Democrats, as well, in the past \u2014 failed to buy American. Not anymore.</p><p>On my watch, federal projects that you fund \u2014 like helping build American roads, bridges, and highways \u2014 will be made with American products and built by American workers creating good-paying American jobs.</p><p>And thanks to our CHIPS and Science Act the United States is investing more in research and development than ever before. During the pandemic, a shortage of semiconductors, chips that drove up the price of everything from cell phones to automobiles \u2014 and, by the way, we invented those chips right here in America.</p><p>Well, instead of having to import them, instead of \u2014 private companies are now investing billions of dollars to build new chip factories here in America creating tens of thousands of jobs, many of those jobs paying $100,000 a year and don\u2019t require a college degree.</p><p>In fact, my policies have attracted $650 billion in private-sector investment in clean energy, advanced manufacturing, creating tens of thousands of jobs here in America.</p><p>And thanks \u2014 and thanks to our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, 46,000 new projects have been announced all across your communities.</p><p>And, by the way, I noticed some of you who\u2019ve strongly voted against it are there cheering on that money coming in. And I like it. I\u2019m with you. I\u2019m with you.</p><p>And if any of you don\u2019t want that money in your district, just let me know.</p><p>Modernizing our roads and bridges, ports and airports, public transit systems. Removing poi- \u2014 poisonous lead pipes so every child can drink clean water without risk of brain damage.</p><p>Providing affordable \u2014 affordable high-speed Internet for every American, no matter where you live \u2014 urban, suburban, or rural communities in red states and blue states.</p><p>Record investments in Tribal communities.</p><p>Because of my investment in family farms \u2014 because I invested in family farms \u2014 led by my Secretary of Agriculture, who knows more about this anybody I know \u2014 we\u2019re better able to stay in the family for the \u2014 those farms so their \u2014 and their children and grandchildren won\u2019t have to leave \u2014 leave home to make a living. It\u2019s transformative.</p><p>The great comeback story is Belvidere, Illinois. Home to an auto plant for nearly 60 years. Before I came to office, the plant was on its way to shutting down. Thousands of workers feared for their livelihoods. Hope was fading.</p><p>Then, I was elected to office, and we raised Belvidere repeatedly with auto companies, knowing unions would make all the difference. The UAW worked like hell to keep the plant open and get these jobs back. And together, we succeeded.</p><p>Instead of auto factories shutting down, auto factories are reopening and a new state-of-the-art battery factory is being built to power those cars there at the same.</p><p>To the folks \u2014 to the folks of Belvidere, I\u2019d say: Instead of your town being left behind, your community is moving forward again. Because instead of watching auto ja- \u2014 jobs of the future go overseas, 4,000 union jobs with higher wages are building a future in Belvidere right here in America.</p><p>Here tonight is UAW President Shawn Fain, a great friend and a great labor leader. Shawn, where are you? Stand up.</p><p>And \u2014 and Dawn \u2014 and Dawn Simms, a third-generation worker \u2014 UAW worker at Belvidere.</p><p>Shawn, I was proud to be the first President to stand in the picket line. And today, Dawn has a good job in her hometown, providing stability for her family and pride and dignity as well.</p><p>Showing once again Wall Street didn\u2019t build America. They\u2019re not bad guys. They didn\u2019t build it, though. The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class.</p><p>I say to the American people: When America gets knocked down, we get back up. We keep going. That\u2019s America. That\u2019s you, the American people.</p><p>It\u2019s because of you America is coming back. It\u2019s because of you our future is brighter. It\u2019s because of you that tonight we can proudly say the state of our Union is strong and getting stronger.</p><p>AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Tonight \u2014 tonight, I want to talk about the future of possibilities that we can build together \u2014 a future where the days of trickle-down economics are over and the wealthy and the biggest corporations no longer get the \u2014 all the tax breaks.</p><p>And, by the way, I understand corporations. I come from a state that has more corporations invested than every one of your states in the state \u2014 the United States combined. And I represented it for 36 years. I\u2019m not anti-corporation.</p><p>But I grew up in a home where trickle-down economics didn\u2019t put much on my dad\u2019s kitchen table. That\u2019s why I\u2019m determined to turn things around so the middle class does well. When they do well, the poor have a way up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well.</p><p>And there\u2019s more to do to make sure you\u2019re feeling the benefits of all we\u2019re doing.</p><p>Americans pay more for prescription drugs than anywhere in the world. It\u2019s wrong, and I\u2019m ending it.</p><p>With a law that I proposed and signed \u2014 and not one of your Republican buddies work- \u2014 voted for it \u2014 we finally beat Big Pharma.</p><p>Instead of paying $400 a month or thereabouts for insulin with diabetes \u2014 and it only costs 10 bucks to make \u2014 they only get paid $35 a month now and still make a healthy profit.</p><p>And I want to \u2014 and what to do next, I want to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it \u2014 everyone.</p><p>For years, people have talked about it. But finally, we got it done and gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices on prescription drugs, just like the VA is able to do for veterans.</p><p>That\u2019s not just saving seniors money. It\u2019s saving taxpayers money. We cut the federal deficit by $160 billion because Medicare will no longer have to pay those exorbitant prices to Big Pharma.</p><p>This year, Medicare is negotiating lower prices for some of the costliest drugs on the market that treat everything from heart disease to arthritis. It\u2019s now time to go further and give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for 500 different drugs over the next decade.</p><p>They\u2019re making a lot of money, guys. And they\u2019ll still be extremely profitable. It will not only save lives; it will save taxpayers another $200 billion.</p><p>Starting next year, the same law caps total prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $200 \u2014 at $2,000 a year, even for expensive cancer drugs that cost $10-, $12-, $15,000. Now I want to cap prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year for everyone.</p><p>Folks, I\u2019m going to get in trouble for saying that, but any of you want to get in Air Force One with me and fly to Toronto, Berlin, Moscow \u2014 I mean, excuse me. Well, even Moscow, probably. And bring your prescription with you, and I promise you, I\u2019ll get it for you for 40 percent the cost you\u2019re paying now. Same company, same drug, same place.</p><p>Folks, the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the old \u201cObamacare\u201d is still a very big deal.</p><p>Over 100 million of you can no longer be denied health insurance because of a preexisting condition. But my predecessor and many in this chamber want to take the \u2014 that prescription drug away by repealing Affordable Care Act.</p><p>AUDIENCE: Booo \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m not going to let that happen. We stopped you 50 times before, and we\u2019ll stop you again.</p><p>In fact, I\u2019m not only protecting it, I\u2019m expanding it. The \u2014 we enacted tax credits of $800 per person per year (to) reduce healthcare costs for millions of working families. That tax credit expires next year. I want to make that savings permanent.</p><p>To state the obvious: Women are more than half of our population, but research on women\u2019s health has always been underfunded.</p><p>That\u2019s why we\u2019re launching the first-ever White House Initiative on Women\u2019s Health Research, led by Jill \u2014 doing an incredible job as First Lady \u2014 to pa- \u2014 to pass my plan for $12 billion to transform women\u2019s health research and benefit millions of lives all across America.</p><p>I know the cost of housing is so important to you. Inflation keeps coming down. Mortgage rates will come down as well, and the Fed acknowledges that.</p><p>But I\u2019m not waiting. I want to provide an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month for the next two years as mortgage rates come down to put toward their mortgages when they buy their first home or trade up for a little more space. That\u2019s for two years.</p><p>And my administration is also eliminating title insurance (fees) on federally backed mortgages. When you refinance your home, you can save $1,000 or more as a consequence.</p><p>For millions of renters, we\u2019re cracking down on big landlords who use antitrust law \u2014using antitrust \u2014 who break antitrust laws by price-fixing and driving up rents.</p><p>We\u2019ve cut red tape so builders can get federally financing, which is already helping build a record 1.7 million new house u- \u2014 housing units nationwide.</p><p>Now pass \u2014 now pass (my plan) and build and renovate 2 million affordable homes and bring those rents down.</p><p>To remain the strongest economy in the world, we need to have the best education system in the world. And I, like I suspect all of you, want to give a child \u2014 every child a good start by providing access to preschool for three- and four-years-old.</p><p>You know, I think I pointed out last year \u2014 I think I pointed out last year that children coming from broken homes where there\u2019s no books, they\u2019re not read to, they\u2019re not spoken to very often start school \u2014 kindergarten or first grade hearing \u2014 having heard a million fewer words spoken.</p><p>Well, studies show that children who go to preschool are nearly 50 percent more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a two- and four-year degree no matter what their background is.</p><p>I met a year and a half ago with the leaders of the Business Roundtable. They were mad that I was ever \u2014 angry \u2014 I \u2014 well, they were discussing why I wanted to spend money on education.</p><p>I pointed out to them: As Vice President, I met with over 8- \u2014 I think it was 182 of those folks \u2014 don\u2019t hold me to the exact number \u2014 and I asked them what they need most \u2014 the CEOs. And you\u2019ve had the same experience on both sides of the aisle. They say, \u201cA better-educated workforce,\u201d right?</p><p>So, I looked at them. And I say, \u201cI come from Delaware. DuPont used to be the eighth-largest corporation in the world. And every new enter- \u2014 enterprise they bought, they educated the workforce to that enterprise. But none of you do that anymore. Why are you angry with me providing you the opportunity for the best-educated workforce in the world?\u201d</p><p>And they all looked at me and said, \u201cI think you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>I want to expand high-quality tutoring and summer learning to see that every child learns to read by third grade.</p><p>I\u2019m also connecting local businesses and high schools so students get hands-on experience and a path to a good-paying job whether or not they go to college.</p><p>And I want to make sure that college is more affordable. Let\u2019s continue increasing the Pell Grants to working- and middle-class families and increase record investments in HBCUs and minority-serving institutions, including Hispanic institutions.</p><p>When I was told I couldn\u2019t universally just change the way in which we did \u2014 dealt with student loans, I fixed two student loan programs that already existed to reduce the burden of student debt for nearly 4 million Americans, including nurses, firefighters and others in public service.</p><p>Like Keenan Jones, a public educator in Minnesota, who\u2019s here with us tonight. Keenan, where are you? Keenan, thank you.</p><p>He\u2019s educated hundreds of students so they can go to college. Now he\u2019s able to help, after debt forgiveness, get his own daughter to college.</p><p>And, folks, look, such relief is good for the economy because folks are now able to buy a home, start a business, start a family.</p><p>And while we\u2019re at it, I want to give public school teachers a raise.</p><p>And, by the way, the first couple of years, we cut the deficit.</p><p>Now let me speak to the question of fundamental fairness for all Americans. I\u2019ve been delivering real results in fiscally responsible ways. We\u2019ve already cut the federal deficit \u2014we\u2019ve already cut the federal deficit by over $1 trillion.</p><p>I signed a bipartisan deal to cut another trillion dollars in the next decade.</p><p>It\u2019s my goal to cut the federal deficit another $3 trillion by making big corporations and the very wealthy finally beginning to pay their fair share.</p><p>Look, I\u2019m a capitalist. If you want to make or can make a million or millions of bucks, that\u2019s great. Just pay your fair share in taxes.</p><p>A fair tax code is how we invest in things that make this country great: healthcare, education, defense, and so much more.</p><p>But here\u2019s the deal. The last administration enacted a $2 trillion tax cut overwhelmingly benefit the top 1 percent \u2014 the very wealthy \u2014</p><p>AUDIENCE: Booo \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: \u2014 and the biggest corporations \u2014 and exploded the federal deficit.</p><p>They added more to the national debt than any presidential term in American history. Check the numbers.</p><p>Folks at home, does anybody really think the tax code is fair?</p><p>AUDIENCE: No!</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Do you really think the wealthy and big corporations need another $2 trillion tax break?</p><p>AUDIENCE: No!</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I sure don\u2019t. I\u2019m going to keep fighting like hell to make it fair. Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in federal taxes nobody \u2014 not one penny. And they haven\u2019t yet.</p><p>In fact, the Child Tax Credit I passed during the pandemic cut taxes for millions of working families and cut child poverty in half.</p><p>Restore that Child Tax Credit. No child should go hungry in this country.</p><p>The way to make the tax code fair is to make big corporations and the very wealthy begin to pay their share. Remember in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion and paid zero in federal income tax. Zero.</p><p>AUDIENCE: Booo \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Not anymore.</p><p>Thanks to the law I wrote and we signed, big companies now have to pay a minimum of 15 percent. But that\u2019s still less than working people pay in federal taxes.</p><p>It\u2019s time to raise the corporate minimum tax to at least 21 percent so every big corporation finally begins to pay their fair share.</p><p>I also want to end tax breaks for Big Pharma, Big Oil, private jets, massive executive pay when it was only supposed to be a million bal- \u2014 a million dollars that could be deducted. They can pay them $20 million if they want, but deduct a million.</p><p>End it now.</p><p>You know, there are 1,000 billionaires in America. You know what the average federal tax is for those billionaires?</p><p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: Zero!</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: No.</p><p>They\u2019re making great sacrifices \u2014 8.2 percent.</p><p>AUDIENCE: Booo \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s far less than the vast majority of Americans pay.</p><p>No billionaire should pay a lower federal tax rate than a teacher, a sanitation worker, or a nurse.</p><p>I proposed a minimum tax for billionaires of 25 percent \u2014 just 25 percent. You know what that would raise? That would raise $500 billion over the next 10 years.</p><p>And imagine what that could do for America. Imagine a future with affordable childcare, millions of families can get what they need to go to work to help grow the economy.</p><p>Imagine a future with paid leave, because no one should have to choose between working and taking care of their sick family member.</p><p>Imagine \u2014 imagine a future with home care and eldercare, and people living with disabilities so they can stay in their homes and family caregivers can finally get the pay they deserve.</p><p>Tonight, let\u2019s all agree once again to stand up for seniors.</p><p>Many of my friends on the other side of the aisle want to put Social Security on the chopping block.</p><p>If anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age, I will stop you.</p><p>The working people \u2014 the working people who built this country pay more into Social Security than millionaires and billionaires do. It\u2019s not fair.</p><p>We have two ways to go. Republicans can cut Social Security and give more tax breaks to the wealthy. I will \u2014</p><p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s the proposal. Oh, no? You guys don\u2019t want another $2 trillion tax cut?</p><p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: Liar!</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I kind of thought that\u2019s what your plan was. Well, that\u2019s good to hear. You\u2019re not going to cut another $2 trillion for the super-wealthy? That\u2019s good to hear.</p><p>I\u2019ll protect and strengthen Social Security and make the wealthy pay their fair share.</p><p>Look, too many corporations raise prices to pad their profits, charging more and more for less and less.</p><p>That\u2019s why we\u2019re cracking down on corporations that engage in price gouging and deceptive pricing, from food to healthcare to housing.</p><p>In fact, the snack companies think you won\u2019t notice if they change the size of the bag and put a hell of a lot fewer \u2014 same \u2014 same size bag -\u2014 put fewer chips in it. No, I\u2019m not joking. It\u2019s called \u201cshrink-flation.\u201d</p><p>Pass Bobby Casey\u2019s bill and stop this. I really mean it.</p><p>You probably all saw that commercial on Snickers bars. And you get \u2014 you get charged the same amount, and you got about, I don\u2019t know, 10 percent fewer Snickers in it.</p><p>Look, I\u2019m also getting rid of junk fees \u2014 those hidden fees \u2014 at the end of your bill that are there without your knowledge. My administration announced we\u2019re cutting credit card late fees from $32 to $8.</p><p>Banks and credit card companies are allowed to charge what it costs them to in- \u2014 to instigate the collection. And that\u2019s more \u2014 a hell of a lot like $8 than 30-some dollars.</p><p>But they don\u2019t like it. The credit card companies don\u2019t like it, but I\u2019m saving American families $20 billion a year with all of the junk fees I\u2019m eliminating.</p><p>Folks at home, that\u2019s why the banks are so mad. It\u2019s $20 billion in profit.</p><p>I\u2019m not stopping there.</p><p>My administration has proposed rules to make cable, travel, utilities, and online ticket sellers tell you the total price up front so there are no surprises.</p><p>It matters. It matters.</p><p>And so does this. In November, my team began serious negotiations with a bipartisan group of senators. The result was a bipartisan bill with the toughest set of border security reforms we\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>AUDIENCE: Booo \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Oh, you don\u2019t think so?</p><p>AUDIENCE: Booo \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Oh, you don\u2019t like that bill \u2014 huh? \u2014 that conservatives got together and said was a good bill? I\u2019ll be darned. That\u2019s amazing.</p><p>That bipartisan bill would hire 1,500 more security agents and officers, 100 more immigration judges to help tackle the backload of 2 million cases, 4,300 more asylum officers, and new policies so they can resolve cases in six months instead of six years now. What are you against?</p><p>One hundred more high-tech drug detection machines to significantly increase the ability to screen and stop vehicles smuggling fentanyl into America that\u2019s killing thousands of children.</p><p>This bill would save lives and bring order to the border.</p><p>It would also give me and any new president new emergency authority to temporarily shut down the border when the number of migrants at the border is overwhelming.</p><p>The Border Patrol union has endorsed this bill.</p><p>(Cross-talk.)</p><p>The federal Chamber of Commerce has \u2014 yeah, yeah. You\u2019re saying \u201cno.\u201d Look at the facts. I know \u2014 I know you know how to read.</p><p>I believe that given the opportunity \u2014 for \u2014 a majority in the House and Senate would endorse the bill as well \u2014 a majority right now.</p><p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes!</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: But unfortunately, politics have derailed this bill so far.</p><p>I\u2019m told my predecessor called members of Congress in the Senate to demand they block the bill. He feels political win \u2014 he viewed it as a \u2014 it would be a political win for me and a political loser for him. It\u2019s not about him. It\u2019s not about me. I\u2019d be a winner \u2014 not really. I \u2014</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE GREENE: What about Laken Riley?</p><p>(Cross-talk.)</p><p>AUDIENCE: Booo \u2014</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE GREENE: Say her name!</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: (The President holds up a pin reading \u201cSay Her Name, Laken Riley.\u201d) Lanken \u2014 Lanken (Laken) Riley, an innocent young woman who was killed.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE GREENE: By an illegal!</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: By an illegal. That\u2019s right. But how many of thousands of people are being killed by legals?</p><p>(Cross-talk.)</p><p>To her parents, I say: My heart goes out to you. Having lost children myself, I understand.</p><p>But, look, if we change the dynamic at the border \u2014 people pay people \u2014 people pay these smugglers 8,000 bucks to get across the border because they know if they get by \u2014 if they get by and let into the country, it\u2019s six to eight years before they have a hearing. And it\u2019s worth the \u2014 taking the chance of the $8,000.</p><p>(Cross-talk.)</p><p>But \u2014 but if it\u2019s only six mon- \u2014 six weeks, the idea is it\u2019s highly unlikely that people will pay that money and come all that way knowing that they\u2019ll be \u2014 able to be kicked out quickly.</p><p>Folks, I would respectfully su- \u2014 suggest to my friend in \u2014 my Republican friends owe it to the American people. Get this bill done. We need to act now.</p><p>AUDIENCE: Get it done! Get it done! Get it done!</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And if my predecessor is watching: Instead of paying (playing) politics and pressuring members of Congress to block the bill, join me in telling the Congress to pass it.</p><p>We can do it together.</p><p>But that\u2019s what he apparently \u2014 here\u2019s what he will not do.</p><p>I will not demonize immigrants, saying they are \u201cpoison in the blood of our country.\u201d</p><p>I will not separate families.</p><p>I will not ban people because of their faith.</p><p>Unlike my predecessor, on my first day in office, I introduced a comprehensive bill to fix our immigration system. Take a look at it. It has all these and more: secure the border, provide a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers, and so much more.</p><p>But unlike my predecessor, I know who we are as Americans. We\u2019re the only nation in the world with a heart and soul that draws from old and new.</p><p>Home to Native Americans whose ancestors have been here for thousands of years. Home to people of every pla- \u2014 from every place on Earth.</p><p>They came freely. Some came in chains. Some came when famine struck, like my ancestral family in Ireland. Some to flee persecution, to chase dreams that are impossible anywhere but here in America.</p><p>That\u2019s America. And we all come from somewhere, but we\u2019re all Americans.</p><p>Look, folks, we have a simple choice: We can fight about fixing the border or we can fix it. I\u2019m ready to fix it. Send me the border bill now.</p><p>AUDIENCE: Fix it! Fix it! Fix it!</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: A transformational his- \u2014 moment in history happened 58 \u2014 59 years ago today in Selma, Alabama. Hundreds of foot soldiers for justice marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, named after the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan, to claim their fundamental right to vote.</p><p>They were beaten. They were bloodied and left for dead. Our late friend and former colleague John Lewis was on that march. We miss him.</p><p>But joining us tonight are other marchers, both in the gallery and on the floor, including Bettie Mae Fikes, known as the \u201cVoice of Selma.\u201d</p><p>The daughter of gospel singers and preachers, she sang songs of prayer and protest on that Bloody Sunday to help shake the nation\u2019s conscience.</p><p>Five months later, the Voting Rights Act passed and was signed into law.</p><p>Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p><p>But 59 years later, there are forces taking us back in time: voter suppression, election subversion, unlimited dark money, extreme gerrymandering.</p><p>John Lewis was a great friend to many of us here. But if you truly want to honor him and all the heroes who marched with him, then it\u2019s time to do more than talk.</p><p>Pass the Freedom to Vote Act, the John Lewis Voting Right(s) Act.</p><p>And stop \u2014 stop denying another core value of America: our diversity across American life. Banning books is wrong. Instead of erasing history, let\u2019s make history.</p><p>I want to protect fundamental rights.</p><p>Pass the Equality Act.</p><p>And my message to transgender Americans: I have your back.</p><p>Pass the PRO Act for workers\u2019 rights.</p><p>Raise the federal minimum wage, because every worker has the right to a decent living more than eig- \u2014 seven bucks an hour.</p><p>We\u2019re also making history by confronting the climate crisis, not denying it. I don\u2019t think any of you think there\u2019s no longer a climate crisis. At least, I hope you don\u2019t.</p><p>I\u2019m taking the most significant action ever on climate in the history of the world.</p><p>I\u2019m cutting our carbon emissions in half by 2030; creating tens of thousands of clean energy jobs, like the IBEW workers building and installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations; conserving 30 percent of America\u2019s lands and waters by 2030; and taking action on environmental justice \u2014 fence-line communities smothered by the legacy of pollution.</p><p>And patterned after the Peace Corps and AmericaCorps (AmeriCorps), I launched the Climate Corps to put 20,000 young people to work in the forefront of our clean energy future. I\u2019ll triple that number in a decade.</p><p>To state the obvious, all Americans deserve the freedom to be safe. And America is safer today than when I took office.</p><p>The year before I took office, murder rates went up 30 percent.</p><p>MR. NIKOUI: Remember Abbey Gate!</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thirty percent, they went up \u2014</p><p>MR. NIKOUI: United States Marines! Kareem Mae\u2019Lee Nikoui!</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: \u2014 the biggest increase in history.</p><p>MR. NIKOUI: (Inaudible.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It was then, through no \u2014 through my American Rescue Plan \u2014 which every American (Republican) voted against, I might add \u2014 we made the largest investment in public safety ever.</p><p>Last year, the murder rate saw the sharpest decrease in history. Violent crime fell to one of its lowest levels in more than 50 years.</p><p>But we have more to do. We have to help cities invest in more community police officers, more mental health workers, more community violence intervention.</p><p>Give communities the tools to crack down on gun crime, retail crime, and carjacking. Keep building trust, as I\u2019ve been doing, by taking executive action on police reform and calling for it to be the law of the land.</p><p>Directing my Cabinet to review the federal classification of marijuana and expunging thousands of convictions for the mere possession, because no one should be jailed for simply using or have it on their record.</p><p>Take on crimes of domestic violence. I\u2019m ramping up the federal enforcement of the Violence Against Women Act that I proudly wrote when I was a senator so we can finally \u2014 finally end the scourge against women in America.</p><p>There are other kinds of violence I want to stop.</p><p>With us tonight is Jasmine, whose nine-year-old sister Jackie was murdered with 21 classmates and teachers in her elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.</p><p>Very soon after that happened, Jill and I went to Uvalde for a couple days. We spent hours and hours with each of the families. We heard their message so everyone in this room, in this chamber could hear the same message.</p><p>The constant refrain \u2014 and I was there for hours, meeting with every family. They said, \u201cDo something.\u201d \u201cDo something.\u201d</p><p>Well, I did do something by establishing the first-ever Office of Gun Violence Prevention in the White House, that the Vice President is leading the charge. Thank you for doing it.</p><p>Meanwhile \u2014 meanwhile, my predecessor told the NRA he\u2019s proud he did nothing on guns when he was President.</p><p>AUDIENCE: Booo \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: After another shooting in Iowa recently, he said \u2014 when asked what to do about it, he said, just \u201cget over it.\u201d That was his quote. Just \u201cget over it.\u201d</p><p>I say stop it. Stop it, stop it, stop it.</p><p>I\u2019m proud we beat the NRA when I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years because of this Congress. We now must beat the NRA again.</p><p>I\u2019m demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Pass universal background checks.</p><p>None of this \u2014 none of this \u2014 I taught the Second Amendment for 12 years. None of this violates the Second Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners.</p><p>(Cross-talk.)</p><p>You know, as we manage challenges at home, we\u2019re also managing crises abroad, including in the Middle East.</p><p>I know the last five months have been gut-wrenching for so many people \u2014 for the Israeli people, for the Palestinian people, and so many here in America.</p><p>This crisis began on October 7th with a massacre by a terrorist group called Hamas, as you all know. One thousand two hundred innocent people \u2014 women and girls, men and boys \u2014 slaughtered after enduring sexual violence. The deadliest day of the \u2014 for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. And 250 hostages taken.</p><p>Here in this chamber tonight are families whose loved ones are still being held by Hamas. I pledge to all the families that we will not rest until we bring every one of your loved ones home.</p><p>We also \u2014 we will also work around the clock to bring home Evan and Paul \u2014 Americans being unjustly detained by the Russians \u2014 and others around the world.</p><p>Israel has a right to go after Hamas. Hamas ended this conflict by releasing the hostages, laying down arms \u2014 could end it by \u2014 by releasing the hostages, laying down arms, and s- \u2014 surrendering those responsible for October 7th.</p><p>But Israel has a h- \u2014 excuse me. Israel has a added burden because Hamas hides and operates among the civilian population like cowards \u2014 under hospitals, daycare centers, and all the like.</p><p>Israel also has a fundamental responsibility, though, to protect innocent civilians in Gaza.</p><p>This war has taken a greater toll on innocent civilians than all previous wars in Gaza combined. More than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed \u2014</p><p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: Says who?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: \u2014 most of whom are not Hamas. Thousands and thousands of innocents \u2014 women and children. Girls and boys also orphaned.</p><p>Nearly 2 million more Palestinians under bombardment or displacement. Homes destroyed, neighborhoods in rubble, cities in ruin. Families without food, water, medicine.</p><p>It\u2019s heartbreaking.</p><p>I\u2019ve been working non-stop to establish an immediate ceasefire that would last for six weeks to get all the prisoners released \u2014 all the hostages released and to get the hostages home and to ease the intolerable an- \u2014 humanitarian crisis and build toward an enduring \u2014 a more \u2014 something more enduring.</p><p>The United States has been leading international efforts to get more humanitarian assistance into Gaza. Tonight, I\u2019m directing the U.S. military to lead an emergency mission to establish a temporary pier in the Mediterranean on the coast of Gaza that can receive large shipments carrying food, water, medicine, and temporary shelters.</p><p>No U.S. boots will be on the ground.</p><p>A temporary pier will enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every day.</p><p>And Israel must also do its part. Israel must allow more aid into Gaza and ensure humanitarian workers aren\u2019t caught in the crossfire.</p><p>And they\u2019re announcing they\u2019re going to \u2014 they\u2019re going to ca- \u2014 have a crossing in Northern Gaza.</p><p>To the leadership of Israel, I say this: Humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority.</p><p>As we look to the future, the only real solution to the situation is a two-state solution over time.</p><p>And I say this as a lifelong supporter of Israel, my entire career. No one has a stronger record with Israel than I do. I challenge any of you here. I\u2019m the only American president to visit Israel in wartime.</p><p>But there is no other path that guarantees Israel\u2019s security and democracy. There is no other path that guarantees Pa- \u2014 that Palestinians can live in peace with po- \u2014 with peace and dignity.</p><p>And there is no other path that guarantees peace between Israel and all of its neighbors \u2014 including Saudi Arabia, with whom I\u2019m talking.</p><p>Creating stability in the Middle East also means containing the threat posed by Iran. That\u2019s why I built a coalition of more than a dozen countries to defend international shipping and freedom of navigation in the Red Sea.</p><p>I\u2019ve ordered strikes to degrade the Houthi capability and defend U.S. forces in the region.</p><p>As Commander-in-Chief, I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and our military personnel.</p><p>For years, I\u2019ve heard many of my Republican and Democratic friends say that China is on the rise and America is falling behind. They\u2019ve got it backwards. I\u2019ve been saying it for over four years, even when I wasn\u2019t president.</p><p>America is rising. We have the best economy in the world. And since I\u2019ve come to office, our GTB (GDP) is up, our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest point in over a decade.</p><p>And we\u2019re standing up against China\u2019s unfair economic practices.</p><p>We\u2019re standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits.</p><p>I\u2019ve revitalized our partnership and alliance in the Pacific: India, Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Pacific Islands. I\u2019ve made sure that the most advanced American technologies can\u2019t be used in China \u2014 not allowing to trade them there.</p><p>Frankly, for all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that.</p><p>I want competition with China, not conflict. And we\u2019re in a stronger position to win the conflict (competition) of the 21st century against China than anyone else for that matter \u2014 than at any time as well.</p><p>Here at home, I\u2019ve signed over 400 bipartisan bills. But there\u2019s more to pass my Unity Agenda.</p><p>Strengthen penalties on fentanyl trafficking. You don\u2019t want to do that, huh?</p><p>Pass bipartisan privacy legislation to protect our children online.</p><p>Harness \u2014 harness the promise of AI to protect us from peril. Ban AI voice impersonations and more.</p><p>And keep our truly sacred obligation to train and equip those we send into harm\u2019s way and care for them and their families when they come home and when they don\u2019t.</p><p>That\u2019s why, with the strong support and help of Denis and the VA, I signed the PACT Act \u2014 one of the most significant laws ever, helping millions of veterans exposed to toxins who now are battling more than 100 different cancers. Many of them don\u2019t come home, but we owe them and their families support.</p><p>And we owe it to ourselves to keep supporting our new health research agency called ARPA-H \u2014 and remind us \u2014 to remind us that we can do big things, like end cancer as we know it. And we will.</p><p>Let me close with this.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yay!</p><p>I know you don\u2019t want to hear anymore, Lindsey, but I got to say a few more things.</p><p>I know I may not look like it, but I\u2019ve been around a while. When you get to be my age, certain things become clearer than ever.</p><p>I know the American story. Again and again, I\u2019ve seen the contest between competing forces in the battle for the soul of our nation, between those who want to pull America back to the past and those who want to move America into the future.</p><p>My lifetime has taught me to embrace freedom and democracy, a future based on core values that have defined America \u2014 honesty, decency, dignity, and equality; to respect everyone; to give everyone a fair shot; to give hate no safe harbor.</p><p>Now, other people my age see it differently. The American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution.</p><p>That\u2019s not me. I was born amid World War Two, when America stood for the freedom of the world. I grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, among working-class people who built this country.</p><p>I watched in horror as two of my heroes \u2014 like many of you did \u2014 Dr. King and Bobby Kennedy, were assassinated. And their legacies inspired me to pur- \u2014 pursue a car- \u2014 a career in service.</p><p>I left a law firm and became a public defender because my city of Wilmington was the only city in America occupied by the National Guard after Dr. King was assassinated because of the riots. And I became a county councilman almost by accident.</p><p>I got elected to the United States Senate when I had no intention of running, at age 29.</p><p>Then vice president to our first Black president. Now a president to the first woman vice president.</p><p>In my career, I\u2019ve been told I was too young. By the way, they didn\u2019t let me on the Senate elevators for votes sometimes. They \u2014 not a joke.</p><p>And I\u2019ve been told I am too old.</p><p>Whether young or old, I\u2019ve always been known \u2014 I\u2019ve always known what endures. I\u2019ve known our North Star. The very idea of America is that we\u2019re all created equal, deserves to be treated equally throughout our lives.</p><p>We\u2019ve never fully lived up to that idea, but we\u2019ve never walked away from it either. And I won\u2019t walk away from it now.</p><p>I\u2019m optimistic. I really am. I\u2019m optimistic, Nancy.</p><p>AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: My fellow Americans, the issue facing our nation isn\u2019t how old we are; it\u2019s how old are our ideas.</p><p>Hate, anger, revenge, retribution are the oldest of ideas. But you can\u2019t lead America with ancient ideas that only take us back. To lead America, the land of possibilities, you need a vision for the future and what can and should be done.</p><p>Tonight, you\u2019ve heard mine.</p><p>I see a future where (we\u2019re) defending democracy, you don\u2019t diminish it.</p><p>I see a future where we restore the right to choose and protect our freedoms, not take them away.</p><p>I see a future where the middle class has \u2014 finally has a fair shot and the wealthy have to pay their fair share in taxes.</p><p>I see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence.</p><p>Above all, I see a future for all Americans. I see a country for all Americans. And I will always be President for all Americans because I believe in America. I believe in you, the American people. You\u2019re the reason we\u2019ve never been more optimistic about our future than I am now.</p><p>So, let\u2019s build the future together. Let\u2019s remember who we are.</p><p>We are the United States of America. And there is nothing \u2014 nothing beyond our capacity when we act together.</p><p>God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>",
