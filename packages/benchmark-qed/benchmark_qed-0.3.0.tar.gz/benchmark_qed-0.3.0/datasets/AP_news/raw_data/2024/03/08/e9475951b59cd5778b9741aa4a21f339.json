    "description_summary": "France has inscribed the guaranteed right to abortion in its constitution, a powerful message of support for women\u2019s rights on International Women\u2019s Day. France is the first country to explicitly guarantee abortion rights in its national charter. The French justice minister used a 19th-century printing press to seal the amendment in France\u2019s Constitution at a special public ceremony Friday. The measure was overwhelmingly approved by French lawmakers earlier this week. The ceremony is a key event on a day focused on advancing women\u2019s rights globally. Marches, demonstrations and conferences are being held the world over, from Asia to Latin America and elsewhere.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>PARIS (AP) \u2014 France inscribed the guaranteed right to abortion in its constitution Friday, in a world first and a powerful message of support to women around the globe on <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/international-womens-day-demonstrations-2024-07e4cb6131641f103558944019839304\">International Women\u2019s Day</a>.</p><p>A woman from Argentina, a couple from Miami and a man from Czechia were among those gathered on the polished cobblestones of Place Vendome in Paris to watch the historic event unfurl in an outdoor ceremony open the public. Women in the crowd recalled their own abortions, or lifelong battles for reproductive rights.</p><p>While abortion is a deeply divisive issue in the United States, it\u2019s legal in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/europe-abortion-rights-constitution-france-f65ef0c520bfbb43d4c201cfc443ca54\">nearly all of Europe and overwhelmingly supported</a> in France, where it\u2019s seen more as a question of public health rather than politics. French legislators approved the constitutional amendment on Monday in a 780-72 vote that was backed by many far-right lawmakers.</p><p>The Paris event was a key moment on a day focused on advancing women\u2019s rights globally. Marches, protests and conferences are being held from Jakarta, Indonesia, to Mexico City and beyond.</p><p>When the French justice minister used a 19th-century printing press to seal the amendment in France\u2019s Constitution, cheers filled the plaza. It ensures \u201cthe freedom of women to have recourse to an abortion, which is guaranteed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor too many years, women\u2019s destinies were sealed by others,'' President Emmanuel Macron said, calling Friday's ceremony the culmination of a \u2018\u2019long fight for freedom'' for women to choose what to do with their bodies.</p><p>The French constitutional amendment has been hailed by women\u2019s rights advocates around the world, including places where women struggle to access birth control or maternal health care. Macron said the move was prompted by the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2022 <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0\">rescinding long-held abortion rights</a>.</p><p>Macron called for other countries to follow suit and proposed including the right to abortion in the European Union\u2019s charter, drawing cheers from the crowd in Paris. However, such a move would likely meet stiff resistance from EU members that have tight abortion restrictions, such as Poland.</p><p>Macron\u2019s critics questioned why he pursued the measure in a country with no obvious threat to abortion rights but where women face a multitude of other problems.</p><p>While some French women saw the step as a major win, others said that in reality not every French woman has access to abortion.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a smokescreen,\u201d Arya Meroni, 32, said of the event.</p><p>\u201cThe government is destroying our health care system, many family planning clinics have closed,\u2019\u2019 she said at an annual \u201cFeminist Night March\u201d in Paris on the eve of International Women\u2019s Day.</p><p>Still, for people like 44-year-old public relations director Lunise Marquis, it was a \u201cmajor milestone for women\u2019s rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are sending a message to the world,\u201d she said.</p><p>France has a persistently high rate of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-ap-top-news-france-international-news-weekend-reads-3556845f3ab74186a26ec6d10739f9ca\">women killed by their partners</a> and challenges remain in prosecuting <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/france-cinema-metoo-sexual-abuse-godreche-e215e51b38c9500c9ac032be99d4e0f0\">sexual abuse against women by powerful celebrities and other men</a>. French women also see lower pay and pensions \u2014 especially women who are not white.</p><p>Macron's government said the abortion amendment was important to avoid a U.S.-like scenario for women in France, as hard-right groups are gaining ground and seeking to turn back the clock on freedoms around Europe.</p><p>Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti used a 100-kilogram (220-pound) press from 1810 to imprint the amendment in France\u2019s 1958 Constitution.</p><p>France follows in the footsteps of the former Yugoslavia, whose 1974 constitution included the phrase: \u201cA person is free to decide on having children.\" Yugoslavia's successor states retained similar language in their constitutions, though they did not spell out guaranteed abortion rights.</p><p>Not everyone saw the day as a cause for celebration, as angry protest marches were held in numerous countries.</p><p>The head of the Danish Trade Union Confederation, which has 1.3 million members, chafed at how differently women and men are treated in some areas.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, we still see sky-high pay differences, professions dominated by one sex, a gender-segregated labor market, harassment cases that primarily affect women and a wide range of other equality problems,\u201d Morten Skov Christensen said.</p><p>In other events Friday:</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ireland-women-constitution-referendum-family-society-319491b98986ae595ae51df13a816570\">In Ireland</a>, voters are deciding whether to change the constitution to remove passages referring to women\u2019s domestic duties and broadening the definition of the family.</p><p>In Italy, where the country\u2019s first female premier is in power, thousands of people marched in Rome to protest gender-based violence. The issue grabbed public attention after the particularly gruesome murder of a young woman last November, which Italian President Sergio Mattarella said Friday \u201cconsumed all of Italy in horror and pain.\u201d Data show more than half of the 120 women murdered in Italy last year were killed by their current or former partners.</p><p>At street rallies in Seoul, participants had an eye on next month\u2019s parliamentary elections in South Korea and expressed hope that parties would prioritize gender equality.</p><p>In Russia, where the United Nations says <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-human-rights-council-ukraine-e240c207035b391795302175cc7013b5\">human rights have deteriorated</a> since the military\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin saluted Russian women fighting in the war and those waiting at home for their loved ones who had been deployed.</p><p>Women in Afghanistan staged rare protests against harsh Taliban restrictions. The country\u2019s rulers have banned girls and women from education above grade six and from most jobs. Females are also barred from public spaces like parks. A group of women gathered indoors in Kabul, holding up signs to hide their faces, and chanted, \u201cNo to gender apartheid\u201d and \u201cAfghanistan is hell for women.\u201d</p><p>Protesters in Turkey sought to call attention to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/turkey-women-killings-femicide-abuse-bd261ad004ded6a8b7ca32c83cab315c\">violence against women</a>.</p><p>Indonesian demonstrators demanded adoption of the International Labor Organization\u2019s conventions concerning gender equality and eliminating workplace violence and harassment. Labor rights groups in Thailand marched to the Government House to petition for better work conditions, and activists marching against violence in the Philippine capital were stopped by police near the presidential palace, sparking a brief scuffle.</p><p>India's government cut the price of cooking gas cylinders by 100 rupees ($1.20) with Prime Minister Narendra Modi posting on social media that the move was \u201cin line with our commitment to empowering women.\u201d</p><p>The United Nations children's agency said in a report released on International Women's Day that more than 230 million women and girls around the world have undergone female genital mutilation. The number has increased by 30 million in the past eight years, it said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re also seeing a worrying trend that more girls are subjected to the practice at younger ages, many before their fifth birthday. That further reduces the window to intervene,\u201d said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.</p><p>Officially recognized by the United Nations in 1977, International Women\u2019s Day is a national holiday in about 20 countries, including Russia, Ukraine and Afghanistan.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press journalists around the world contributed to this report.</p>",
