Many in the abortion rights movement have long viewed him as an imperfect messenger. As Biden\u2019s campaign seeks to harness the issue for his re-election bid, his aides believe they can reach a broader swath of voters by framing the issue around reproductive freedom, as the fallout from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has expanded into areas such as IVF and birth control.",

The issue <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-kamala-harris-abortion-c634452da5e103913982e1cc5a0cae78\">could be pivotal</a> in the presidential race and congressional contests this year.</p><p>During Thursday\u2019s speech, Biden deviated from his prepared remarks, skipping over the word \u201cabortion\u201d and instead using the phrases \u201creproductive freedom\u201d or \u201cfreedom to choose.\u201d</p><p>The word was used once in his prepared remarks, when he introduced <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-kate-cox-texas-exceptions-e85664b2ab76bcb689b1b91913d3e33e\">Kate Cox</a>, first lady Jill Biden\u2019s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/state-union-guest-list-attendance-2024-biden-003c5da894f9fd7af2c8289a267ac7b0\">State of the Union guest</a> and a Texas woman who was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-texas-court-kate-cox-complications-3e24f473b0eab907993ddcad189e8115\">forced to flee</a> the state for an abortion after finding out her fetus had a fatal condition. The text had Biden saying, \u201cBecause Texas law banned abortion.\u201d Instead, he said \u201cBecause Texas law banned her ability to act.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s common for elected officials, especially Biden, to go off script or make in-the-moment tweaks for a host of reasons.</p><p>\u201cBy not saying the word \u2018abortion,\u2019 it implies that it\u2019s taboo or something to be ashamed of,\u201d said Kellie Copeland, executive director of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ohio-constitutional-amendment-republicans-courts-fb1762537585350caeee589d68fe5a0d\">Pro-Choice Ohio.</a> \u201cIt\u2019s stigmatizing and harmful. The president should do better.\u201d</p><p>Amy Hagstrom Miller, president and CEO of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, which manages abortion clinics in Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico and Virginia, said there was an \u201cuproar\" across the organization as staff members texted their reactions to each other.</p><p>\u201cAbortion is what we provide and what people are being denied,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t call us for a reproductive freedom appointment. They don\u2019t ask for a bodily autonomy visit or a choice procedure. They call for abortion care, and abortion is a professional medical term for the health care we provide. Avoiding the word just shows the power of the historical stigma around abortion.\u201d</p><p>The pushback over how he addressed the issue in his State of the Union speech is the latest example of Biden's fraught history with the topic. Many in the abortion rights movement have long viewed him as an imperfect messenger.</p><p>Biden initially opposed the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, saying it <a href=\"https://www.washingtonian.com/1974/06/01/joe-biden-kitty-kelley-1974-profile-death-and-the-all-american-boy/\">went too far</a>. He also <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6127591-biden77letter.html\">opposed federal funding f</a> or abortions and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/election-2023-abortion-amendment-ohio-strategy-610e427f753a6803e4a59b7af8aa744f\">supported restrictions on abortions</a> later in pregnancy.</p><p>The Biden campaign's strategy is to let the president be who he is \u2014 an 81-year-old Catholic man whose views on the issue have evolved and who still doesn\u2019t use the word abortion much. His aides also want to highlight his evolution on the issue and how he still grapples with what can be an uncomfortable topic but believes firmly in the freedom of choice.</p><p>\u201cDonald Trump on the other hand has repeatedly used disgusting and derogatory language when referring to women, and he will institute a national abortion ban,\" said Lauren Hitt, spokesperson for the Biden campaign. \"The choice in this election is incredibly clear.\"</p><p>Trump has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-biden-us-supreme-court-election-2020-religion-a157d2c1f1d6e5cf190df27ba17ce3ae\">taken credit</a> for appointing three Supreme Court justices who made overturning Roe v. Wade possible.</p><p>Biden's aides believe they can reach a broader swath of voters by framing the issue around reproductive freedom, as the fallout from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ahmaud-arbery-today-in-history-us-supreme-court-politics-united-states-05a2524ea37528f85e3ec1390e9a3106#:~:text=On%20June%2024%2C%202022%2C%20The,in%20roughly%20half%20the%20states.\">overturn Roe v.

She added that Biden could be more explicit about how his perspective on abortion has changed, something many voters may be able to relate to.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a story they can tell,\u201d she said.</p><p>Polling has found that Americans broadly support abortion rights, and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ballot-measure-2024-state-vote-e7d635835dc3a440789ad87787553ec1\">voters in seven states</a> have either affirmed the right or defeated attempts to weaken it since the Supreme Court ruling. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-poll-roe-dobbs-ban-opinion-fcfdfc5a799ac3be617d99999e92eabe\">poll</a> conducted in June 2023 <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-poll-roe-dobbs-ban-opinion-fcfdfc5a799ac3be617d99999e92eabe\">found that about two-thirds</a> (64%) of U.S. adults think abortion should be legal in at least some circumstances. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/democracy-2024-election-trump-biden-poll-39309519c8473175c25ab5a305e629ba\">Another survey</a> conducted later that year also found that 60% of U.S. adults think the outcome of the 2024 election will be very important for abortion policy.</p><p>Many advocates say they want to see Biden offer more full-throated support for abortion rights in particular and have said they sense discomfort in his approach to speaking on the topic.</p><p>\u201cAbortion could very well be the issue that the election hinges on,\u201d Nourbese Flint, president of the national abortion justice group All(asterisk) Above All Action Fund. \"If President Biden wants to speak to the American electorate, whatever their faith, he should use his bully pulpit to be bold on abortion access.\u201d</p><p>The State of the Union address was the latest showcase of Biden's complicated relationship with the topic.</p><p>He told The New Yorker last week: \u201cI\u2019ve never been supportive of, you know, \u2018It\u2019s my body, I can do what I want with it.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Last month in New York, Biden referred to himself as a \u201cpracticing Catholic\u201d before saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want abortion on demand, but I thought Roe v. Wade had it right.\u201d He used similar words on the 51st anniversary of that court decision.</p><p>And during a Maryland fundraiser last year for his reelection campaign, he said: \u201cI\u2019m a practicing Catholic. I\u2019m not big on abortion. But guess what? Roe v. Wade got it right.\u201d</p><p>Advocates also have criticized Biden\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cabortion on demand,\u201d which they say was once an abortion rights rallying cry that was co-opted by the anti-abortion movement.</p><p>\u201cThose comments around \u2018abortion on demand\u2019 are tied to stigma around abortion,\u201d said Dr. Jamila Perritt, president and CEO of Physicians for Reproductive Health.</p><p>Still, she said, \u201cWe need to make clear that we are much better off under that leadership than under those who want to ban abortion outright.\u201d</p><p>Biden has repeatedly called on Congress to restore Roe v. Wade protections, and his administration has made several moves to improve reproductive health care access. That includes defending the FDA's approval of the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-abortion-pill-mifepristone-fda-approval-c673116607517af1e0e0f9ba95d0f9df\">abortion drug mifepristone</a> and supporting the agency in allowing pharmacies to get certified to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cvs-walgreens-mifepristone-abortion-adaa5f92afa0f7b8ed5801e976932380\">dispense the drug</a>.</p><p>Federal agencies under his administration also have improved abortion access for <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-veterans-affairs-db955f3dd3833faf337fec069e8966d7\">veterans and service members,</a> issued guidance reminding abortion providers of their federal protections when performing abortions <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-government-and-politics-4221f9306a596904b9af2e0d1fad23b9\">during medical emergencies</a>, and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alabama-abortion-justice-department-2fbde5d85a907d266de6fd34542139e2\">filed lawsuits</a> to defend the right to travel to another state for abortion care.</p><p>Biden has been endorsed by major abortion rights organizations, including <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/pressroom/planned-parenthood-endorses-biden-for-re-election-amid-continued-attacks-on-reproductive-freedom\">Planned Parenthood</a> and <a href=\"https://reproductivefreedomforall.org/endorsements/\">Reproductive Freedom for All</a>, whose CEO, Mini Timmaraju, praised Biden for speaking \"powerfully about the harms of abortion bans and attacks on IVF\u201d in his State of the Union remarks.</p><p>Biden used part of his address to thank Vice President Kamala Harris, who has embarked on a multistate reproductive freedom tour.</p><p>Jennifer Driver, senior director of reproductive rights at State Innovation Exchange, called Harris a \u201cchampion for abortion rights,\" but said, \u201cWe also need the president to be vocal on this issue.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Colleen Long and Linley Sanders contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

While abortion and reproductive rights are health-related issues, the document's main emphasis is on the political strategy, public reactions, and historical context of Biden's stance on abortion. It does not delve deeply into health aspects such as medical procedures, health outcomes, or healthcare policies beyond the political framing. Therefore, while there is some relevance to health, it is not the primary focus of the document."
