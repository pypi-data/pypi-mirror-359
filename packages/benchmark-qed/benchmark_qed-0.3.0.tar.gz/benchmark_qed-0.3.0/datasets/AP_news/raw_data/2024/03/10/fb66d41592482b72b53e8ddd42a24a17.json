Parents themselves can even be part of the problem by texting during school hours with questions about what they want for dinner or how they did on a test. Teachers and experts say it's generally best to hold off until after school. Teachers say you can still reach your child if you have a change in plans or a family emergency: Just contact the front office.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>Virginia high school teacher Joe Clement keeps track of the text messages parents have sent students sitting in his economics and government classes:</p><p>\u2014 \u201cWhat did you get on your test?\u201d</p><p>\u2014 \u201cDid you get the field trip form signed?\u201d</p><p>\u2014 \u201cDo you want chicken or hamburgers for dinner tonight?\u201d</p><p>Clement has a plea for parents: Stop texting your kids at school.</p><p>Parents are distressingly aware of the distractions and the mental health issues associated with smartphones and social media. But teachers say parents might not realize how much those struggles <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/school-cell-phone-ban-01fd6293a84a2e4e401708b15cb71d36\">play out at school</a>.</p><p>One culprit? Mom and Dad themselves, whose stream-of-consciousness questions add to a climate of constant interruption and distraction from learning. Even when schools regulate or ban cellphones, it's hard for teachers to enforce it. And the constant buzzes on watches and phones are occupying critical brain space regardless of whether kids are sneaking a peek.</p><p>A few changes in parents' behavior can help make phones less distracting at school. Here's what teachers and experts recommend.</p><hl2>TRY IT: STOP TEXTING YOUR KID AT SCHOOL</hl2><p>Many parents stay in touch with their child by texting, but school is a place for focusing on learning and developing independence. Teachers say you can still reach your child if you have a change in plans or a family emergency: Just contact the front office.</p><p>If the message is not urgent, it can probably wait.</p><p>Think of it this way: \u201cIf you came to school and said, \u2018Can you pull my child out of calculus so I can tell them something not important?' we would say no,\u201d central Virginia school counselor Erin Rettig said.</p><p>Teachers emphasized: They are not saying parents are to blame for school cellphone battles, just that parents can do more to help. Tell your kids, for example, not to text home unless it is urgent. And if they do, ignore it.</p><p>\u201cWhen your children are texting you stuff that can wait \u2014 like, \u2018Can I go to Brett\u2019s house five days from now?\u2019 \u2014 don\u2019t respond,\u201d said Sabine Polak, one of three mothers who co-founded the Phone-Free Schools Movement. \u201cYou have to stop engaging. That\u2019s just feeding the problem.\u201d</p><hl2>CUT THE CORD FROM 8 TO 3</hl2><p>Many parents got used to being in constant contact during the COVID-19 pandemic, when kids were home doing online school. They have kept that communication going as life has otherwise returned to normal.</p><p>\u201cWe call it the digital umbilical cord. Parents can\u2019t let go. And they need to,\u201d Clement said.</p><p>Parents might not expect their kids to respond immediately to texts (though many do). But when students pull out their phones to reply, it opens the door to other social media distractions.</p><hl2>ANXIETY VIA TEXT MESSAGE</hl2><p>At parent workshops, Rettig, the school counselor in Virginia, tells parents they are contributing to children\u2019s anxiety by sending messages, tracking their whereabouts and checking grades daily, which doesn't give kids space to be independent at school.</p><p>Some teachers say they get emails from parents right after returning graded exams, before the class is over, because kids feel the need (or are told) to report grades immediately to parents.</p><p>Dr. Libby Milkovich, a developmental and behavioral pediatrician at Children's Mercy Kansas City, says she asks parents to consider what kids miss out on by having parents at arms' reach during school hours.</p><p>\u201cBy texting back and forth with a parent, a child is unable to practice either self-calming or problem-solving skills,\u201d Milkovich said. \u201cIt's easy to text, but if I don't have a phone, I have to go ask the teacher or I have to figure it out on my own.\u201d</p><p>Some kids who oppose school cellphone bans say it's helpful to reach out to parents when they're feeling anxious or worried at school. For children with serious anxiety who are accustomed to texting parents for reassurance, Milkovich suggests phasing in limits so the child can gradually practice having more independence. She urges parents to ask themselves: Why does my child need constant access to a phone?</p><p>\u201cOften parents say, \u2018I want to be able to reach my child at any time,\u2019 which has nothing to do with the child\u2019s outcome. It\u2019s because of the parents\u2019 anxiety,\u201d she said.</p><hl2>TAKE AWAY THAT OLD PHONE</hl2><p>Beth Black, a high school English teacher in the San Francisco Bay Area, tells parents to consider confiscating their child\u2019s old phones.</p><p>Her school requires students to put phones in a special cellphone holder when they enter classrooms. But she has seen students stash their old, inactive phone there, and hold onto the phone that works.</p><p>Like many teachers, she says phones aren't the only problem. There's also the earbud issue.</p><p>\"Forty percent of my students have at least one earbud in when they walk into class,\u201d Black said. \u201cThe kids will set their phone in the holder to music and they\u2019ll listen to music in class in one earbud.\u201d</p><hl2>TURN OFF NOTIFICATIONS</hl2><p>Parents' reining in their texts will only go so far. So work with your kids to turn off some or all of their attention-stealing notifications.</p><p>To prove just how distracting smartphones are, Clement ran an in-class experiment where he asked students to take their phones off silent and switch on notifications for two minutes.</p><p>\u201cIt sounded like an old-time video arcade \u2014 bizzing, buzzing, dinging and ringing for two solid minutes,\u201d he said.</p><p>Many studies have found students check their phones frequently during class. A study last year from Common Sense Media found teens get bombarded with as many as 237 notifications a day. About 25% of them pop up during the school day, mostly from friends on social media.</p><p>\u201cEvery time our focus is interrupted, it takes a lot of brain power and energy to get back on task,\u201d said Emily Cherkin, a Seattle-based teacher-turned-consultant who specializes in screen-time management.</p><p>Teachers say the best school cellphone policy is one that physically removes the phone from the child. Otherwise, it\u2019s hard to compete.</p><p>\u201cWhen the phone vibrates in their pocket, now their focus is on their pocket. And they\u2019re wondering, \u2018How do I get it out to the table? How do I check it?\u2019\" said Randy Freiman, a high school chemistry teacher in upstate New York. \u201cYou ask them a question and they haven\u2019t heard a word you\u2019ve said. Their brain is elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press\u2019 education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations. AP is solely responsible for all content.
