The image of Kate and her children was intended to calm concern and speculation about the princess\u2019s health, but had the opposite effect. Several news agencies that initially published the photo, including The Associated Press, withdrew the image over concerns about digital manipulation. Issued by the couple\u2019s Kensington Palace office on Sunday, it was the first official photo of Kate since her abdominal surgery nearly two months ago. The retractions sent online speculation about Kate's health into overdrive. On Monday, Kate said on social media that she occasionally edits photos. She offered an apology for any confusion.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>LONDON (AP) \u2014 Kate, Princess of Wales, apologized Monday for \u201cconfusion\u201d <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kate-princess-photo-surgery-ca91acf667c87c6c70a7838347d6d4fb\">caused by her altering of a family photo</a> released by the palace \u2014 an image of Kate and her children that was intended to calm concern and speculation about the British royal's health, but had the opposite effect.</p><p>Several news agencies that initially published the photo, including <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/princess-wales-kate-surgery-photo-manipulated-3863e9ac78aec420a91e4f315297c348\">The Associated Press</a>, withdrew the image over concerns about digital manipulation. Issued by the couple\u2019s Kensington Palace office on Sunday to mark Mother\u2019s Day in Britain, it was the first official photo of 42-year-old Kate since she had <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kate-princess-of-wales-operation-uk-royals-eea1a111a295152b8820b94fd257c12d\">abdominal surgery</a> nearly two months ago.</p><p>The retractions sent the online rumor mill, already rampant <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kate-princess-of-wales-trooping-color-britain-d55d1e8bbf1a9357b116e8b38a16e92d\">with speculation</a> over Kate\u2019s operation and recuperation, into overdrive. The PR disaster is more evidence that the royal family\u2019s long-held mantra \u2014 \u201cnever complain, never explain\u201d \u2014 is impossible in a social media-saturated era.</p><p>In a post on social media, Kate said that \u201clike many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused,\u201d the post said.</p><p>In the past, the palace has issued several of Kate's family snapshots featuring her and heir to the throne, Prince William, with their children Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 5.</p><p>The latest photo was taken by William, Kensington Palace said. In an accompanying social media message, Kate said: \u201cThank you for your kind wishes and continued support over the last two months. Wishing everyone a Happy Mother\u2019s Day.\u201d</p><p>While there was no suggestion the photo was fake, AP retracted it because closer inspection revealed the source had manipulated the image in a way that did not meet AP\u2019s photo standards. For instance, it contained an inconsistency in the alignment of Princess Charlotte\u2019s left hand with the sleeve of her sweater.</p><p>Other major news agencies, including Getty, Reuters, AFP and the U.K. national agency, PA, also withdrew the photo.</p><p>Kensington Palace said it would not release the original unedited photograph. And while Kate\u2019s statement provided a measure of clarification, it looked unlikely to stop the swirl of rumor that has accelerated during her absence from public duties.</p><p>Former BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt said the mishandled photo release \u201cis damaging for the royals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey knew there would be intense interest in any picture they released of Kate,\u201d he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. \"Their challenge is that people will now question whether they can be trusted and believed when they next issue a health update.\u201d</p><p>The royal family is under particular scrutiny because <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/king-charles-iii-cancer-britain-e0408a7c9bb86ad2af8754ce4b37d65e\">King Charles III</a> has also had to cancel public duties while he undergoes treatment for an unspecified form of cancer. The monarch has canceled all his public engagements, though he has been photographed walking to church and meeting privately with government officials and dignitaries.</p><p>Charles\u2019 relative openness about his diagnosis was a departure for the generally secretive royal family. But it has been eclipsed in popular interest by curiosity over Kate\u2019s condition. In the absence of firm information, conspiracy theories have rushed to fill the vacuum.</p><p>The release of the photo followed weeks of gossip on social media about what had happened to Kate since she left a hospital Jan. 29 after a nearly two-week stay following planned surgery. She hadn\u2019t been seen publicly since Christmas Day.</p><p>Kate underwent surgery Jan. 16 and her condition and the reason for the operation have not been revealed, though Kensington Palace said it was not cancer-related.</p><p>Although the palace initially said that it would only provide significant updates and that she would not return to royal duties before Easter \u2014 March 31 this year \u2014 it followed up with a statement last month saying she was doing well.</p><p>At the time, royal aides told The Sun newspaper: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the madness of social media and that is not going to change our strategy. There has been much on social media but the princess has a right to privacy and asks the public to respect that.\u201d</p><p>Further questions were raised last week when the British military seemed to jump the gun in announcing Kate would attend a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/king-charles-iii-trooping-color-638ceb562184e4a9840dc690908eea3f\">Trooping the Color</a> ceremony in June, apparently without consulting palace officials.</p><p>It\u2019s up to palace officials, not government departments, to announce the royals\u2019 attendance at events. Kensington Palace didn\u2019t confirm any scheduled public events for Kate, and the army later removed reference to her attendance.</p><p>William, Queen Camilla and other senior royals attended a Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on Monday. Neither Kate nor the king was due to be at the event, which drew a crowd of several dozen anti-monarchist protesters holding signs reading \u201cDown with the Crown.\u201d</p><p>William was also due to speak at an event for the Earthshot Prize, an environmental competition that he founded.</p><p>Veteran public relations consultant Mark Borkowski said the photo gaffe exposed a wider PR problem for the monarchy.</p><p>\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be that much joined-up strategic thinking at the heart of the royal family at the moment, which leads to these problems where it\u2019s a very difficult organization to manage in terms of PR,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI find they have risen to the challenge, provided the statement as an explanation,\" he said of Kate's apology Monday. \"The question is, with all the conspiracy theories running around, is whether people believe it. And I\u2019m not sure that they will.\u201d</p>",
