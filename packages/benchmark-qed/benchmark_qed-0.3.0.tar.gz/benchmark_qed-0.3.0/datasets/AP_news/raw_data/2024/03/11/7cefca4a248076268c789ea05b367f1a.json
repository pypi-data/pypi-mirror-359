Instead, GOP leaders accuse abortion rights advocates of deliberately spreading misinformation and doctors of intentionally denying services in an effort to undercut the bans and make a political point. At the same time, however, some states are taking steps that they say will provide more clarity about when abortions can be legally performed. Abortion rights advocates say those steps will likely not be enough to solve the problem.",

(AP) \u2014 In Republican-led states across the U.S., conservative legislators are refusing to reevaluate <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/abortion\">abortion bans</a> \u2014 even as doctors and patients insist the laws\u2019 exceptions are dangerously unclear, resulting in denied treatment to some pregnant women in need.</p><p>Instead, GOP leaders accuse abortion rights advocates of deliberately spreading misinformation and doctors of intentionally denying services in an effort to undercut the bans and make a political point. At the same time, however, some states are taking steps that they say will provide more clarity about when abortions can be legally performed.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-dakota-legislature-kristi-noem-abortion-fc7bc9ed83ffbb480b1855c4f65c0374\">Republican-controlled South Dakota Legislature</a> wants to create a video in which medical experts \u2014 and the state's attorneys \u2014 would explain to doctors and patients when abortions can be legally performed. The measure was passed last month and is now awaiting the signature of Republican Gov. Kristi Noem, who has indicated she will sign it.</p><p>The first-in-the-nation idea is wholeheartedly supported by SBA Pro-Life, one of the country's largest anti-abortion groups, which says the video will help to combat \u201cconfusion caused by the abortion industry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSouth Dakota is showing the rest of the nation how to protect women\u2019s lives from the misinformation surrounding abortion laws,\u201d said the organization's public affairs director in South Dakota, Kelsey Pritchard.</p><p>Oklahoma and Kentucky are also taking steps to clarify their abortion bans, though in both states the attorneys general, not physicians, are the ones dictating the terms.</p><p>In Oklahoma, the AG sent out a memo in 2022 informing prosecutors and police that doctors should have \u201csubstantial leeway\u201d to provide certain abortions. Last year, the office added that patients don't have to be \u201cseptic, bleeding profusely, or otherwise close to death\u201d \u2014 but reiterated a past warning that doctors should be prosecuted if there's evidence they violated the law by providing an abortion when a woman's life wasn't actually in danger.</p><p>Kentucky's attorney general has stated that miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies \u2014 when a fertilized egg grows outside the uterus \u2014 are both exempted from the state's abortion ban, but has been silent on the majority of other pregnancy complications that physicians and patients have pointed out.</p><p>Since the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0\">U.S. Supreme Court overturned</a> the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, states have been free to enact their own restrictions. South Dakota is among the 14 that ban abortion at all stages of pregnancy. The law does allow an abortion exception to save the life of the mother, but like similar statutes in other states, it does not clearly define which pregnancy complications are considered life-threatening.</p><p>State Republican Rep. Taylor Rehfeldt, a nurse anesthetist, said she decided to propose the informational video after hearing from physicians about the ongoing confusion. She said the video offered the best solution because any attempt to tweak the abortion ban itself would provoke strong disagreement among her GOP colleagues.</p><p>It remains to be seen how much help the video will be to patients and doctors, however. It's not expected to specifically list pregnancy complications that would legally qualify women for abortions, and it's unclear if it will contain a legal disclaimer warning that anyone who watches the video may still face potential criminal charges.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to deal with hard calls,\u201d said Greer Donley, an associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law who is an expert on abortion law. \u201cThey actually don\u2019t want to deal with the hard calls because their movement is not sure ... how those hard calls should be resolved.\u201d</p><p>South Dakota Republican state Sen. Erin Tobin, one of the measure's proponents, acknowledged to a Senate panel last month that the video will not contain specific examples.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem with health care, is that there are so many different circumstances, that you have to allow doctors discretion,\u201d Tobin said.</p><p>As some states mull how to clarify \u2014 without weakening \u2014 their abortion bans, abortion rights advocates in several states continue to challenge the bans with lawsuits.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/texas-abortion-law-lawsuit-6346a3b98dd3ece069177f88172ce7b8\">Twenty Texas women denied abortions</a> are suing the state seeking clarification, while advocates filed a lawsuit in Tennessee arguing that the state ban's vaguely defined exceptions put pregnant women's lives at risk.</p><p>Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti pushed back. He argued that it wasn't the law, per se, that is harming women but rather \u201cother factors like doctors\u2019 independent choices not to provide permissible abortions.\"</p><p>The lawsuit is ongoing, with attorneys expected to make their arguments before a three-judge panel next month on whether the state ban should be temporarily blocked as the legal battle continues or if the case should be dismissed entirely.</p><p>Donley spurned the idea that doctors bear the responsibility for endangering patients.</p><p>\u201cI completely reject any narrative that there\u2019s any sort of provider out there that\u2019s intentionally harming women and pregnant people for the sake of a news story,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s just not happening. But are mistakes being made because people are terrified? Yeah, probably.\u201d</p><p>In Texas, a pregnant woman whose fetus had a fatal condition went straight to the state supreme court last year to request an exemption from the Lone Star State's strict ban. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-texas-exceptions-lawsuit-82611bda29112775247d8e7adbc0a81b\">The court denied Katie Cox's request</a> \u2014 forcing her to go out of state to get an abortion \u2014 but did urge the Texas Medical Board to issue guidance to doctors on how to interpret the law.</p><p>\u201cWhile the judiciary cannot compel executive branch entities to do their part, it is obvious that the legal process works more smoothly when they do,\u201d the justices wrote.</p><p>And yet, the medical board, comprising 19 members appointed by the governor, has so far not offered any sort of guidance.</p><p>Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is a vocal abortion opponent.</p><p>Frustrated with the board's inaction, Amy and Steven Bresnen, a couple who are lawyers and lobbyists, filed a petition in January asking it to clarify what circumstances qualify as medical exceptions to the state's abortion ban.</p><p>\"Pregnant females in life-threatening situations and the health care providers otherwise willing to save their lives simply cannot be required to stand idly in the void when the TMB (Texas Medical Board) has the authority to act and the duty to regulate medicine in this state in the public interest,\u201d the petition states.</p><p>The board is expected to meet later this month and will likely address the petition, Steven Bresnen said.</p><p>\u201cNobody has put them on the spit to make them make a formal decision,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they decline to, they have to explain why.\u201d</p>",

It includes information about legislative actions, legal battles, and the roles of medical boards and attorneys general. While the primary focus is on the legal and political aspects of abortion bans, the document also touches on health-related issues such as the implications for pregnant women's health and the responsibilities of healthcare providers. Therefore, it is relevant to the topic of health, but not exclusively focused on it."
