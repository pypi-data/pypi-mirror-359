That's according to the European Environment Agency\u2019s first-ever risk assessment about the impact of climate change on the continent. It says the continent is the fastest-warming in the world and is prone to increasing extreme heat, downpours and floods, and Southern Europe is particularly vulnerable to severe droughts. It says the bloc has made substantial progress and has a lot of policies to counteract the long-term effects of climate change, but societies are not prepared for more urgent climate threats.",

It classified eight as needing urgent attention \u2013 like conserving ecosystems, protecting people against heat, protecting people and infrastructure from floods and wildfires, and securing relief funds for disasters.</p><p>The report said Europe is the world\u2019s fastest-warming continent and has been <a href=\"https://climate.copernicus.eu/esotc/2022/european-state-climate-2022-summary\">heating up</a> twice as fast as other regions since the 1980s. The heat has been linked to more intense rains and floods, and the report predicts rainfall decline and more severe droughts in southern Europe.</p><p>Without urgent and decisive action, it warns, many of the climate risks it identified could become catastrophic. To reduce climate risks and improve adaptation to warming, it recommends that the EU and its member states collaborate with regional and local bodies.</p><p>The report is \u201ca huge wake-up call\u201d for the continent, said Manon Dufour, Brussels director for climate think tank E3G, and could have implications for climate policy at both the European and national levels.</p><p>At the European level, Dufour said the report could \"open the eyes\u201d of European leaders who are currently most focused on security issues, as climate can affect economic and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-climate-boris-johnson-business-germany-e13e47b5c3784fa26e61d49502797295\">energy security</a>.</p><p>On a national level, Dufour said finance ministers in particular should be spurred by the report \u201cto make economic and social resilience the key priority.\u201d She pointed to the report's finding that economic losses from heat waves and floods could reach 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) a year by the end of the century.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s clearly in our best interest to adapt to changing risks we can no longer avoid, including preparedness for bigger extremes and surprises, and to avoid the risks from getting further out of hand by reducing greenhouse gases,\u201d said Maarten van Aalst, director-general at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.</p><p>Sven Harmeling, head of climate at Climate Action Network Europe, said Europe \u201ccan do more, even by 2030,\u201d to slash emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas, and can also step up its investments in adapting to climate change, particularly by preserving ecosystems like wetlands and forests that can both absorb carbon and act as natural extreme weather barriers.</p><p>He urged that any efforts to reduce the impact of warming \u201cmust deliver this in a way that provides social and economic benefits for all.\u201d</p><p>Greenpeace EU climate campaigner Silvia Pastorelli agreed, adding that the bloc should focus any resilience programs, like retrofitting homes to help with heating in winter and cooling in summer, on the most vulnerable communities. \u201cFairness in the climate response is essential,\u201d Pastorelli said.</p><p>The report says the EU and its member states have made \u201cconsiderable progress\u201d in understanding their climate risks and preparing for them.</p><p>For example, Europe \u201chas done well in relation to coastal flooding,\u201d according to Julie Berckmans, an EEA climate risk expert. She said there have been no catastrophic storm floods on the continent in 60 years, and some progress has also been made in managing the health risks from heat and large river floods.</p><p>But more action is needed in all these areas \u201cbecause the risks are increasing rapidly,\u201d she said. As a case in point, heat stress to populations is at critical levels, Berckmans said. One solution, she said, is countries and cities can improve their spatial planning to be more fit for the future health risk from heat.</p><p>The European Commission will present its plan of action on Tuesday in response to the report.</p><p>EU Commission spokesperson Tim McPhie said EEA\u2019s report has \u201cgiven a very clear warning and a very clear call to action of what\u2019s to come.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press journalist Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.
