A doctor will then deliver a prescription, valid for three months, for the lethal medication.</p><p>People will be able to take the medication at home, at a nursing home or at a health care facility, Macron said.</p><p>If their physical condition doesn\u2019t allow them to do it alone, they will be allowed to get help from someone of their choice or by a doctor or a nurse.</p><p>Macron said the new bill will refer to \u201caid in dying \u2026 because it\u2019s simple and humane,\u201d rather than terms like euthanasia or medically assisted suicide.</p><p>Medically assisted suicide involves patients taking, of their own free will, a lethal drink or medication that has been prescribed by a doctor to those who meet certain criteria. Euthanasia involves doctors or other health practitioners giving patients who meet certain criteria a lethal injection at their own request.</p><p>Macron set no date for the legislation to be applied, saying it will first need to follow a monthslong legislative process that will start in May.</p><p>A 2016 French law provides that doctors can keep terminally ill patients sedated before death but stops short of allowing assisted suicide and euthanasia.</p><p>Some French patients travel to other European countries to seek further options. Assisted suicide is allowed in neighboring Switzerland as well as in Portugal. Euthanasia is currently legal in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain under certain conditions.</p>",
