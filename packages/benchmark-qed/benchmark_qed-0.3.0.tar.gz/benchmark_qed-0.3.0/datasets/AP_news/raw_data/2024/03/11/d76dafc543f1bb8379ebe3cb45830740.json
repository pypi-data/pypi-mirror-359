The report released Monday examined New Jersey\u2019s response to the pandemic that sickened nearly 3 million people in New Jersey and killed over 33,000. The report was led by a former assistant state attorney general now in private practice. It faults planning, communication and decision-making before and during the pandemic that erupted in March 2020. But it also says mask mandates and vaccination campaigns helped fight the spread of the virus. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy requested the report in late 2022.",

(AP) \u2014 New Jersey and the nation were not prepared when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and the state \u201cremains underprepared for the next emergency,\u201d according to an independent report examining New Jersey's response to the pandemic that sickened nearly 3 million people statewide and killed over 33,000.</p><p>The report released Monday faults planning, communication and decision-making before and during the pandemic, which broke out in early 2020.</p><p>Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy called the pandemic \u201cthe greatest crisis our state has ever faced.\u201d</p><p>He promised an outside review of his administration's response to the outbreak in its early days. The $9 million publicly funded report was done by the law firm of Montgomery McCracken Walker & Rhoads LLP and Boston Consulting Group. It was led by Paul Zoubek, a former assistant state attorney general.</p><p>\u201cI know New Jersey will be better off because of this review, and my administration looks forward to working with the Legislature on its recommendations,\" Murphy said.</p><p>State Republicans have been sharply critical of Murphy's performance during the pandemic, including mask mandates and shutdowns, but had not publicly reacted to the release of the report as of early Monday afternoon.</p><p>The report was blunt in listing failures leading up to the pandemic, as well as during it.</p><p>\u201cWe collectively failed as a nation and as a state to be adequately prepared,\u201d Zoubek wrote. \u201cAt the state level, heroic actions were taken to respond in good faith to the crisis. Despite the lessons of the last four years, New Jersey remains underprepared for the next emergency.\u201d</p><p>The report also noted things New Jersey did well during the pandemic, including making \u201csignificant systemic improvements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe state, to its credit, took bold and early steps designed to substantially reduce the number of people infected: shut-downs, quarantines, mask requirements, and social distancing were all implemented and resulted in dramatic improvements in health outcomes over the course of the pandemic. By the Delta and Omicron wave, New Jersey became one of the states with the lowest death rates,\u201d the report read.</p><p>It also said the state's campaign to vaccinate residents and convince those hesitant to receive the shots helped New Jersey combat the spread of the virus.</p><p>\u201cBut no level of effort could overcome an inadequate healthcare infrastructure and scarcity of basic medical supplies,\u201d the report read. \u201cNeither the state nor the federal government had clear, executable plans in place to respond to and manage such limited resources in an uncertain and rapidly evolving environment.\u201d</p><p>In a typical example, the report noted that in 2015 \u2014 five years before the pandemic \u2014 the state health department created a \u201cpandemic influenza plan\u201d that the report said \u201cwas extremely accurate in predicting what would eventually happen during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d</p><p>But the existence of that plan was not widely known within senior state leadership when COVID-19 hit, the report said, adding that several people in state government it interviewed said \u201csome other agency\u201d ought to have an emergency preparedness manager for such instances.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, that position exists (and is staffed) in the other agency, but the people we spoke with were unaware of that fact,\u201d the report said.</p><p>The report also found that communal care facilities, including those caring for veterans were particularly vulnerable to the spread of the virus due in part to \u201cwholly inadequate infection controls.\u201d</p><p>The report accepted previously issued criticism by the U.S. Department of Justice and the State Commission of Investigation finding \u201cbroad failures in leadership and management,\u201d including a \u201csystemic inability to implement clinical care policy, poor communication between management and staff, and a failure to ensure basic staff competency (that) let the virus spread virtually unchecked throughout the facilities.\u201d</p><p>The report recommended updating and \u201cstress-testing\u201d existing emergency response plans, conducting training and practice exercises across the state for a wider range of emergencies, not just pandemics.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Wayne Parry on X, formerly Twitter, at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC</p>",
