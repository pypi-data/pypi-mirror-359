    "description_summary": "Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen has approved regulations tied to a new Nebraska law restricting gender-affirming care for minors. The approved regulations mostly mirror temporary ones adopted last October, when the law went into effect. They include a seven-day waiting period for anyone under 19 to start puberty-blocking medications or hormone treatments. Transgender minors must also undergo at least 40 hours of \u201cgender-identity-focused\u201d therapy that is \u201cclinically neutral\u201d before receiving any medical treatments meant to affirm their gender identities. The new law passed last session bans gender-affirming surgeries for trans youth under 19. It also required the state\u2019s chief medical officer to spell out when and how those youth can receive other care.",

Jim Pillen, and they largely mirror temporary regulations adopted last October \u2014 including a seven-day waiting period to start puberty-blocking medications or hormone treatments.</p><p>Other regulations require transgender patients under the age of 19 \u2014 the age of majority in Nebraska \u2014 to meet several therapy benchmarks. They include undergoing at least 40 hours of therapy that could push back on a person's gender identity before they can receive any medical treatments meant to affirm their gender identities. Minor patients must also receive at least one hour of therapy every 90 days while on gender-affirming medication to evaluate the patient\u2019s mental health.</p><p>Health care providers also are required to obtain three hours of continuing education before they can prescribe puberty blockers or hormones.</p><p>The regulations approved by Pillen were those recommended by Nebraska Chief Medical Officer Timothy Tesmer, who was appointed to that post by Pillen last year, following a public hearing in November. The recommendation and approval came despite dozens of families, medical providers and advocates testifying for hours at the hearing opposing the restrictions and regulations.</p><p>\u201cState officials have decided to flatly ignore the serious concerns raised by impacted young people as well as their family members and their medical and mental health providers,\u201d said Grant Friedman, a legal fellow for the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska. \u201cTo be clear, we are talking about gender-affirming care that is endorsed by major medical organizations and recognized as often life-saving care.\"</p><p>The <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-transgender-ban-nebraska-filibuster-b0b88845d29f1aaadf7936b7304a0507\">new law</a> was authored by state Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha and passed last session. It took effect Oct. 1 and bans gender-affirming surgeries for trans youth under 19. It also required the state\u2019s chief medical officer to spell out when and how those youth can receive other care. The state Department of Health and Human Services issued <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-health-minors-nebraska-genderaffirming-care-6c2530ba89e90cff64119548b61f7049\">temporary regulations</a> on Oct. 1.</p><p>\u201cAs a state, we must protect children from making potentially irreversible and regrettable decisions \u2014 decisions for which they may not completely understand the consequences,\" Pillen said in a news release announcing his approval of the regulations.</p><p>At least 23 states have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, and most of those states face lawsuits \u2014 including <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-abortion-nebraska-supreme-court-579472ab7aeb14db59dd26880116f164\">Nebraska</a>. A federal judge <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/politics-arkansas-gender-lgbtq-legislation-us-news-2a0d032f4e4f3195c180d879239e6521\">struck down Arkansas\u2019 ban</a> as unconstitutional. Judges\u2019 orders are in place temporarily blocking the enforcement of the bans in Idaho and Montana.</p>",
