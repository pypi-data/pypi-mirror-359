The program operates at six airports and on Tuesday, the CDC said it was adding two more \u2014 Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare and Miami.</p><p>Those locations should provide more information about respiratory infections coming out of South America, Africa and Asia, particularly, CDC officials said.</p><p>\u201cMiami and Chicago enable us to collect samples coming from areas of the world where global surveillance is not as strong as it used to be,\u201d said the CDC's Allison Taylor Walker. \u201cWhat we really need is a good view of what\u2019s happening in the world so we\u2019re prepared for the next thing.\u201d</p><p>The program began in 2021, and has been credited with detecting coronavirus variants faster than other systems. The genomic testing of traveler's nasal swabs has mainly been focused on COVID-19, but testing also is being done for two other respiratory viruses \u2014 flu and RSV.</p><p>Participants are not notified of their results. But they are given a COVID-19 home test kit to take with them, CDC officials say.</p><p>Samples have come from more than 475,000 air travelers coming off flights from more than 135 countries, officials said.</p><p>Health officials also have been sampling wastewater that comes off international flights at a few airports. That testing is for COVID-19, but CDC officials are evaluating the possibility of monitoring wastewater for other things, Walker said.</p><p>The CDC program has a current budget of about $37 million. The agency pays two companies, Ginkgo Bioworks and XWell, to do sample collection and testing. The companies are working with CDC to grow the program to check for more than 30 different disease-causing germs.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
