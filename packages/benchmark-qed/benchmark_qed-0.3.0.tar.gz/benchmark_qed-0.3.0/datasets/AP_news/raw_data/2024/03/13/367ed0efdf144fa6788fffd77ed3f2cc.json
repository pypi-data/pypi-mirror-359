He wants to put the brakes on a plan considered by his predecessor. That plan was to dip into the state\u2019s opioid lawsuit settlement to investigate the use of ibogaine, with the goal of gaining federal approval to distribute it as a medication to treat opioid addiction. Ibogaine is a Schedule 1 drug in the U.S. Coleman says the state has to be \u201cresponsible stewards\u201d of settlement funds. He commented Tuesday before the Opioid Abatement Advisory Commission,",

(AP) \u2014 Kentucky's new attorney general, Russell Coleman, has urged a commission tasked with fighting drug abuse to \u201cstep back\u201d from a proposal to invest in a psychedelic drug as a possible treatment for opioid addiction.</p><p>When the Republican's predecessor was in office, the commission had considered dipping into the state's massive opioid lawsuit settlement to study the use of ibogaine \u2014 a psychedelic with an international following that remains a Schedule 1 drug in the U.S. \u2014 with the goal of gaining federal approval to distribute it as a medication to treat opioid addiction.</p><p>Speaking to the Kentucky Opioid Abatement Advisory Commission, Coleman said the state has to be \u201cresponsible stewards\u201d of settlement funds, which were \u201cpurchased by the pain of Kentucky families.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that spirit, I respectfully ask this commission to step back from previous proposals to allocate $42 million to ibogaine research and the unproven and incredibly expensive clinical trial,\" Coleman said Tuesday.</p><p>\u201cThese vital resources \u2014 that some call \u2018blood money\u2019 \u2014 are too precious to gamble away,\u201d he added.</p><p>Although overdose fatalities remain staggeringly high, there have been glimmers of hope.</p><p>Kentucky had 2,135 <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/opioid-fentanyl-drug-abuse-kentucky-1d722e922bce94d51e5cd7116f832226\">overdose deaths</a> in 2022, down more than 5% from the prior year and the first statewide decline since 2018. The increased prevalence of fentanyl \u2014 a powerful synthetic opioid \u2014 is blamed by officials as a key factor behind the state's high death toll. Potent, inexpensive methamphetamine is seen as another significant contributor.</p><p>Coleman urged the commission to pursue innovations that \u201cpush the boundaries of addiction response,\u201d and said he would like to see the group establish a $5 million pool for research and innovation grants.</p><p>\u201cWith a new fund tailored to big ideas, Kentucky can keep pushing the outer limit in this space,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if someone brings forward an ibogaine research proposal that fits the criteria of this new innovative grant program, I hope the commission would give it full and fair consideration.\u201d</p><p>The attorney general appoints some of the commission members under state law, and Coleman has named a new executive director.</p><p>Kentucky secured more than $800 million as part of settlements with companies for their roles in the opioid addiction crisis. Half of Kentucky\u2019s settlement will go directly to cities and counties. The commission oversees the state\u2019s half and has started awarding funding to grassroots groups that specialize in drug prevention, treatment and recovery services.</p><p>\u201cWith a new round of grant applications already underway, I look forward to seeing the selections you make this year,\" Coleman told the commission.</p><p>Coleman, who took office at the start of the year, outlined his priorities for combating the Bluegrass State's drug addiction woes. Strong treatment and enforcement programs are in place, he said, noting that there are \u201cfinally enough treatment beds available in Kentucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we are entering a new phase with a new challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to build up the third leg of the stool: prevention.\u201d</p><p>The attorney general's office is developing prevention initiatives, with a focus on youth education, Coleman said. Those conversations with children need to start earlier, he said, and he urged the commission to be part of the effort to \u201cbuild a gold-standard\u201d statewide prevention program.</p><p>\u201cWhen kids as young as 11 are dying from fatal overdoses \u2026 when a young person with limitless potential is stolen away because he thought he was taking a Xanax, it\u2019s our responsibility to prepare them for this threat,\" Coleman said.</p>",
