    "description_summary": "Researchers revved up immune cells that shrank an extremely aggressive type of brain tumor when tested in a handful of patients. The experiments are just first steps but they signal a new strategy to fight hard-to-treat glioblastoma. It's a twist on the CAR-T therapy already used to treat leukemia, by modifying patients' own disease-fighting T cells to be better cancer hunters. Now Massachusetts General Hospital and the University of Pennsylvania are trying next-generation versions strengthened to try to overcome glioblastoma's stronger defenses. Early findings were published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine and Nature Medicine.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A new strategy to fight an extremely aggressive type of brain tumor showed promise in a pair of experiments with a handful of patients.</p><p>Scientists took patients\u2019 own immune cells and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wa-state-wire-genetic-frontiers-washington-seattle-north-america-52d6989c79ba42f1adc4794b2283e85e\">turned them into \u201cliving drugs\u201d</a> able to recognize and attack glioblastoma. In the first-step tests, those cells shrank tumors at least temporarily, researchers reported Wednesday.</p><p>So-called CAR-T therapy already is used <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/science-health-cancer-leukemia-gene-therapy-7bb38e71a15c83c84f201a0fa19b0a3d\">to fight blood-related cancers</a> like leukemia but researchers have struggled to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/technology-science-health-oregon-genetics-d65b649692be6991676f3fe19e31cc4d\">make it work for solid tumors</a>. Now separate teams at Massachusetts General Hospital and the University of Pennsylvania are developing next-generation CAR-T versions designed to get past some of glioblastoma\u2019s defenses.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very early days,\u201d cautioned Penn\u2019s Dr. Stephen Bagley, who led one of the studies. But \u201cwe\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ve got something to build on here, a real foundation.\u201d</p><p>Glioblastoma, the brain cancer that killed President Joe Biden\u2019s son Beau Biden and longtime Arizona Sen. John McCain, is fast-growing and hard to treat. Patients usually live 12 to 18 months after diagnosis. Despite decades of research, there are few options when it returns after surgery and radiation.</p><p>The immune system's T cells fight disease but cancer has ways to hide. With CAR-T therapy, doctors genetically modify a patient\u2019s own T cells so they can better find specific cancer cells. Still, solid tumors like glioblastoma offer an additional hurdle \u2014 they contain mixtures of cancer cells with different mutations. Targeting just one type allows the rest to keep growing.</p><p>Mass General and Penn each developed two-pronged approaches and tried them in patients whose tumors returned after standard treatment.</p><p>At Mass General, Dr. Marcela Maus\u2019 lab combined CAR-T with what are called T-cell engaging antibody molecules \u2014 molecules that can attract nearby, regular T cells to join in the cancer attack. The result, dubbed CAR-TEAM, targets versions of a protein called EGFR that\u2019s found in most glioblastomas but not normal brain tissue.</p><p>Penn\u2019s approach was to create \u201cdual-target\u201d CAR-T therapy that hunts for both that EGFR protein plus a second protein found in many glioblastomas.</p><p>Both teams infused the treatment through a catheter into the fluid that bathes the brain.</p><p>Mass General tested three patients with its CAR-TEAM and brain scans a day or two later showed their tumors rapidly began shrinking, the researchers reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p><p>\u201cNone of us could really believe it,\u201d Maus said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>Two of the patients' tumors began to regrow soon and a repeat dose given to one of them didn\u2019t work. But one patient\u2019s response to the experimental treatment lasted more than six months.</p><p>Similarly, Penn researchers reported in Nature Medicine that the first six patients given its therapy experienced varying degrees of tumor shrinkage. While some rapidly relapsed, Bagley said one treated in August so far hasn't seen regrowth.</p><p>For both teams, the challenge is to make it longer-lasting.</p><p>\u201cNone of this is going to matter if it doesn't last,\u201d Bagley said.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
