    "description_summary": "Public health officials in Arizona\u2019s most populous county report they confirmed a staggering 645 heat-associated deaths last year. That is another consecutive annual record in arid metro Phoenix. The numbers in the preliminary report released Wednesday alarmed officials in America\u2019s hottest big metro. They raise concerns about how to better protect vulnerable groups such as homeless people and older adults from the blistering summer heat. The report by the Maricopa County Department of Public Health says two-thirds of last year\u2019s heat-related deaths were of people 50 years or older. It says 71% of the deaths were on excessive heat warning days.",

There were 339 heat-associated deaths confirmed in 2021.</p><p>No other major metropolitan area in the U.S. has reported such high heat-associated death figures or spends so much time tracking and studying them.</p><p>Maricopa County's public health officials since 2006 have tracked deaths in which environmental heat was the cause or a major contributing factor. The department uses information from preliminary death reports completed by the county's Office of the Medical Examiner, along with data in death certificates on file with the county's Office of Vital Registration.</p><p>Last summer, Phoenix experienced the hottest three months since record-keeping began in 1895, including the hottest July and the second-hottest August. The daily average temperature of 97 F (36.1 C) in June, July and August passed the previous record of 96.7 F (35.9 C) set three years ago.</p><p>Phoenix also set a record in July with a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/heat-warming-climate-environment-temperature-phoenix-arizona-d7db7d44effcdab554b6a742288eb2be\">31-day streak</a> of highs at or above 110 F (43.3 C).</p><p>In recognition of the growing problem of heat associated deaths, Arizona's department of public health last week named a physician as the first statewide heat officer in the nation to address extreme environmental heat.</p><p>Dr. Eugene Livar was appointed to the state role under Gov.

It suggested that residents also help by volunteering at a cooling center to let it stay open later, or donate supplies, such as water, reusable bottles, hats, sunscreens and cooling towels.</p><p>That county public health department also released the <a href=\"https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphhnqtzb.r.us-west-2.awstrack.me%2FL0%2Fhttps%3A%252F%252Fwww.maricopa.gov%252F1871%252FExtreme-Heat%2F1%2F0101018e38b2d5f3-0ca3d474-df28-403d-9785-305108076f8b-000000%2FhG6U6E2JbNl2eHABd3NyXfdhXKY%3D366&data=05%7C02%7Casnow%40ap.org%7C1421486310a5423e0bb808dc437cc24c%7Ce442e1abfd6b4ba3abf3b020eb50df37%7C1%7C0%7C638459450341943127%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=D22JPL9Iao8wIHuGJgQUkO2OlSyvMX3gfBITpFD7gqw%3D&reserved=0\">results of an evaluation</a> of the cooling and respite centers that operated around the county last year.</p><p>County officials hope to use the information to provide additional services during the upcoming summer, such as a bilingual heat relief call center to answer questions and help people get transportation to and from cooling centers.</p><p>About two-thirds of people who responded to a survey about cooling centers said they did not have a stable home.
