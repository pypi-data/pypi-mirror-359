And Dr. Dennis Miskellah, deputy secretary general of the union, said they would disregard the court order the same way the government had disregarded three court orders to increase basic pay for doctors and reinstate suspended doctors.</p><p>Miskellah said medical interns make up 27%t of the workforce in Kenya's public hospitals and their absence means more sick people are being turned away from hospitals. Some doctors, however, have remained on duty to ensure patients in the intensive care units don't die.</p><p>In an interview with leading broadcaster Citizen TV, Miskellah said doctors were committing suicide out of work-related frustration, while others have had to fundraise to get treated for sickness due to a lack of a comprehensive health coverage.</p><p>The impact of the strike was felt across the country with many patients left unattended or being turned away from hospitals across the East African nation.</p><p>Pauline Wanjiru said she brought her 12-year-old son for treatment on his broken leg, which had started to produce a smell, but she was turned away from a hospital in Kakamega county in Western Kenya.</p><p>In 2017, doctors at Kenya's public hospitals held a 100-day strike \u2014 the longest ever held in the country \u2014 to demand better wages and for the government to restore the country's dilapidated public-health facilities. They also demanded continuous training of and hiring of doctors to address a severe shortage of health professionals.</p><p>At the time, public doctors, who train for six years in university, earned a basic salary of $400-$850 a month, similar to some police officers who train for just six months.</p><p>____</p><p>Follow AP\u2019s Africa coverage at: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/africa\">https://apnews.com/hub/africa</a></p>",
