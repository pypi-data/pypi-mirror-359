    "description_summary": "A bill that sought to change wording in an existing Iowa law outlining the penalties for terminating a pregnancy has been shelved by a Republican lawmaker amid debate about its implications for in vitro fertilization. The bill withdrawn Thursday would have criminalized the death, or serious injury to what it said was an \u201cunborn person\" from fertilization to live birth. The Senate Republican joined Democrats in voicing concerns about the potential impact for in vitro fertilization after an Alabama court considered frozen embryos to be children. The Senate declined to consider the bill passed last week by the Iowa House.",

Skyler Wheeler said it \u201csimply changes the words\" of the law. But Democrats raised a recent Alabama case, warning that the proposed language would apply to embryos and therefore pose a risk to the procedure that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ivf-alabama-over-35-cancer-lupus-sickle-cell-8a6e653c79511fc39bbb7c2267941e7a\">helps some women</a> become pregnant.</p><p>Republican Sen. Brad Zaun, who leads the Senate judiciary committee, did not assign the bill to a subcommittee because he was concerned about the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d for IVF, he told reporters.</p><p>After the Senate rejected the bill, the chair of the House judiciary committee, Rep. Steven Holt, said they did not believe IVF was at risk because of differences in Iowa and Alabama's constitutions. Still, Holt said, he understood the concerns and said it's \u201ccertainly a discussion we\u2019ve got to have before we would move it on\" in the future.</p><p>The majority ruling of Alabama\u2019s Supreme Court treated an embryo the same as a child or gestating fetus under the state\u2019s wrongful death law, explicitly stating \u201cunborn children are \u2018children.\u2019\u201d That led three major providers of IVF in Alabama to pause services because of concerns about liabilities.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alabama-ivf-frozen-embryos-ruling-cab8171e80c88a088778dc7a187b7b5a\">Alabama's elected officials</a> have since <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alabama-ivf-clinic-lawsuit-immunity-things-know-0d16d3be139f42c96bc3ab35c4467f55\">moved to clarify</a> that IVF providers are protected from liability related to the destruction of or damage to an embryo.</p><p>Democratic Rep. Jennifer Konfrst criticized House Republicans for the initial denial that IVF was at stake, which Democrats had warned before it passed.</p><p>\u201cThey got caught running a bill that did more than they said. They mocked us when we said it did that. And then other Republicans pulled the bill because it did just what we said,\u201d Konfrst told reporters Thursday. \u201cThat is politics at its worst.\u201d</p>",
