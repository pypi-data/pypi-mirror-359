Supporters were confident Thursday that the Republican-controlled Senate would approve a bill that would bar health care providers from treating a child\u2019s gender dysphoria with puberty blockers, hormone treatments and surgery. But GOP leaders wanted to send the bill to Gov. Laura Kelly with the two-thirds majority that would be necessary to override her veto later, so they cancelled a vote on the bill in hopes of rewriting some language to get the last vote. The GOP-controlled House approved the measure Wednesday and it appears to have a two-thirds majority there.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Republican legislators in Kansas are close to banning gender-affirming care for minors over the Democratic governor\u2019s expected veto after winning over previously skeptical GOP colleagues, fueling fears that success will encourage further attempts to roll back transgender rights.</p><p>Supporters were confident Thursday that the Republican-controlled Senate would approve a bill that would bar health care providers from treating a child\u2019s gender dysphoria with puberty blockers, hormone treatments and surgery and strip doctors who violate the ban of their licenses. But GOP leaders wanted to send the bill to Gov. Laura Kelly with the two-thirds majority necessary to override her veto later, and so after planning a final vote for Thursday, they canceled it in hopes of rewriting some of its language to lock in the last vote.</p><p>\u201cIt's close enough,\u201d said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican, predicting final passage next week.</p><p>The bill already passed the GOP-controlled House <a href=\"https://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2023_24/measures/vote_view/je_20240313114044_979326/\">on Wednesday</a>, so the Senate\u2019s approval would send it to Kelly.</p><p>At least 23 other states with Republican legislatures have restricted or banned gender-affirming care for minors. Kansas lawmakers attempted to pass a ban last year, but GOP supporters in the Senate failed to override Kelly\u2019s veto of a bill last year by a single vote \u2014 and three Republicans voted \u201cno\u201d then.</p><p>Republicans said the issue is making sure that minors receiving hormone treatment now can phase out those treatments, rather than stopping them immediately, in part to avoid legal problems. Senators would have to get the House to vote to agree on any change.</p><p>That decision to try to lock in a two-thirds majority in the Senate before a veto after supporters had a net gain of 12 votes in favor of a ban Wednesday compared with the vote on it last year. Including supporters who were absent Wednesday, backers appeared to have a two-thirds majority in the House.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was out and about last summer and last fall, and the number of emails and the number of calls that I had, I didn\u2019t have a single one tell me to vote the same as I did last year,\u201d state Rep. Susan Concannon, a Republican from western Kansas, said Thursday.</p><p>While supporters say they\u2019re concerned about protecting children, the Kansas bill has stoked fears among transgender adults and LGBTQ+ advocates that GOP lawmakers will follow other GOP-led states and seek more restrictions next year.</p><p>While Ohio\u2019s state government last month <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ohio-transgender-genderaffirming-regulations-adults-dewine-179092da5e1bf7c23f7141832e39d87d\">backed off</a> limiting care for adults, a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/florida-transgender-health-care-adults-e7ae55eec634923e6593a4c0685969b2\">2023 Florida law</a> aimed at care for children also restricted care for adults \u2014 as did a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-care-missouri-emergency-rule-withdrawn-c3ce483448f4013a6f46f666051db6b2\">short-lived Missouri rule</a>.</p><p>\u201cThe goalposts are not firm,\u201d said Iridescent Riffel, a 27-year-old transgender Lawrence resident and LGBTQ+ rights activist who\u2019s worked against the bill. \u201cThey will always continue to be moved further and further right.\u201d</p><p>Opponents of such restrictions in Kansas already have promised a legal challenge if they are enacted. Courts elsewhere have blocked enforcement of bans in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/us-news/arkansas-gender-general-news-2a0d032f4e4f3195c180d879239e6521\">Arkansas</a>, Idaho and Montana but allowed their enforcement in Alabama <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/georgia-hormone-replacement-ban-allowed-439208098e3f4db1dc53d7f1950a48d3\">and Georgia</a>.</p><p>Laws restricting or banning gender-affirming care are out of step with the recommendations of major U.S. medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. And providers of the care say it saves lives by lessening depression and anxiety that can lead to suicide.</p><p>Young transgender adults and parents of transgender or non-binary children from Kansas further told lawmakers that gender-affirming is vital to their health, adding that providers didn\u2019t rush their decisions and were clear about potential side effects.</p><p>Anthony Alvarez, a 20-year-old transgender University of Kansas student, said he had to wait several months after a doctor was willing to prescribe his testosterone treatments to undergo an additional evaluation to confirm he was sure about wanting them.</p><p>He had looked forward to his voice deepening and growing facial hair and hopes to have the double mastectomy known as \u201ctop surgery\u201d in December. He said he\u2019s much happier since his transition because the depression and anxiety that marked his life before have waned.</p><p>\u201cThose aren\u2019t things that are causing the gender dysphoria. They\u2019re being caused by the gender dysphoria \u2014 the reaction to a world that is kind of hostile towards you,\u201d he said in an interview.</p><p>Yet Republican lawmakers portray puberty blockers and hormone treatments as too risky for children. Top Republican House leaders in Kansas said in a statement Wednesday that they were preventing irreversible harm from \u201cexperimental\u201d treatments.</p><p>The bill's backers cited a <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/clinical-policy-puberty-suppressing-hormones/\">statement this week</a> from the National Health Service in England, saying \u201cthere is not enough evidence\u201d that puberty blockers are safe and effective to \u201cmake the treatment routinely available,\u201d something U.S. care providers dispute. The NHS statement followed <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/uk-transgender-puberty-blockers-abd9145484006fea23de6b4656c937da\">a temporary policy</a> the NHS set last year.</p><p>In a meeting of GOP senators early Thursday, Senate Health Committee Chair Beverly Gossage, a Kansas City-area Republican, led a short briefing on the bill with, \u201cIt\u2019s talking about children.\u201d</p>",
