    "description_summary": "South Carolina\u2019s top doctor came before a small group of state senators to tell them he thinks a bill overhauling how public health emergencies are handled in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic has some bad ideas. Gov. Henry McMaster backed his concerns. Dr. Edward Simmer is the director of the state Department of Health and Environmental Control. He told a subcommittee on Thursday that the bill's proposed restrictions on vaccine mandates would prevent requiring flu vaccines or other shots that get yearly updates for ever-changing viruses. Simmer also says letting people out of quarantine after five days without symptoms would allow diseases like measles and Ebola to quickly spread. That's because those diseases can take weeks for symptoms to appear.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) \u2014 South Carolina\u2019s top doctor came before a small group of state senators on Thursday to tell them he thinks a bill overhauling how public health emergencies are handled in the wake of the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-coronavirus-pandemic-d5f35ddaa4942b01add6ef5c1d550b5e\">COVID-19 pandemic</a> has some bad ideas, concerns echoed by Gov. Henry McMaster.</p><p>As drafted, the bill would prevent <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-health-coronavirus-pandemic-south-carolina-henry-mcmaster-d795c32685fde4fa1b1c0f7b896cec05\">mandating vaccines</a> unless they have been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for 10 years. That means that health care providers would be blocked from requiring flu vaccines or other shots that get yearly updates for ever-changing viruses, said Dr. Edward Simmer, director of the state Department of Health and Environmental Control.</p><p>In addition to loosening restrictions on who can visit people in isolation, the measure would also require symptom-free patients to be released from quarantine well before some infectious diseases begin to show outward signs, Simmer said at a Thursday hearing.</p><p>\u201cThere are a number of issues that we believe where this bill would cause harm to the people of South Carolina and would in fact cause unnecessary death amongst people of South Carolina during a public health crisis because it would prevent us from taking actions that could save lives,\u201d Simmer said.</p><p>The bill passed the Senate subcommittee on a 4-3 vote, but with eight weeks to go in the General Assembly's session, it still has to get through the body's Medical Affairs Committee and a vote on the Senate floor before it can even be sent to the House.</p><p>In a further sign of the hurdles the bill faces, McMaster sent the subcommittee a letter saying \u201cplacing overbroad restrictions on the authority of public health officials, law enforcement officers, first responders, and emergency management professionals responding to emerging threats and disasters\u2014whether public health or otherwise \u2014 is a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>A similar subcommittee <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/covid19-pandemic-vaccine-south-carolina-041ad84a6f8cd5f086ea61db4c3c81d3\">met in September</a>, where many speakers sewed doubt about vaccine safety and efficacy, as well as distrust in the scientific establishment.</p><p>Members on Thursday listened to Simmer and took up some amendments on his concern and promised to discuss his other worries with the bill.</p><p>\u201cYou are making some good points, Dr. Simmer. I'm writing them all down,\u201d Republican Sen. Richard Cash of Powdersville said.</p><p>The proposal would require health officials to release someone from quarantine if they didn't show symptoms for five days. Simmers said people with diseases like measles, meningitis, bird flu and Ebola are contagious, but may not show symptoms for a week or more.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we would want after 10 days to release a person known to be infected with Ebola into the public,\" Simmer said.</p><p>Supporters of the bill said they weren't happy that during the start of the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-health-education-coronavirus-pandemic-south-carolina-1c2fc1fec7a7a714ac36909ee1367448\">COVID-19 pandemic</a> hospitals and nursing homes put patients into isolation. Allowing quicker releases from isolation and letting more people to visit someone in quarantine was a response to that issue.</p><p>Cash told Simmer that when the pandemic shutdown started, his wife had just endured a 17-hour cancer surgery and he was ordered to leave her bedside.</p><p>\u201cWhatever she's got, I got. But I still had to go,\u201d Cash said.</p><p>Simmer said those decisions were made by the private nursing homes, hospitals and health care facilities. He said he had sympathy for decisions that had to be made quickly without much data, but he thought they were still wrong and pointed out the state didn't order anyone to take a vaccine or isolate entire facilities.</p><p>\u201cWe saw the pictures of people seeing nursing home patients through a window. They should have been allowed in,\" Simmer said. \"When that didn\u2019t happen that was a mistake. That was a lesson learned from COVID.\u201d</p><p>Simmer asked lawmakers to pay attention to what actually happened during the pandemic and not just what they think happened.</p><p>\u201cIf this bill is designed to address concerns about COVID, we should recognize what did and did not happen during the pandemic,\u201d Simmer said.</p>",
