    "description_summary": "North Carolina's labor commissioner has declined to adopt rules sought by worker and civil rights groups that would have set safety and masking directives in workplaces for future infectious disease outbreaks like with COVID-19. Commissioner Josh Dobson announced his decision Wednesday. A public hearing was held on two rule petitions in January. One rule focused on controlling the spread of infectious diseases among migrant workers. The other covered workers more broadly in various fields. The North Carolina State AFL-CIO was one of the petitioners. Its president urged Dobson to reconsider. Dobson isn't seeking reelection this year.",

(AP) \u2014 North Carolina\u2019s elected labor commissioner has declined to adopt rules sought by worker and civil rights groups that would have set safety and masking directives in workplaces for future infectious disease outbreaks like with COVID-19.</p><p>Commissioner Josh Dobson, a Republican, announced Wednesday that his refusal came \u201cafter carefully reviewing the rulemaking petitions, the record, public comments, listening to both sides and considering the North Carolina Department of Labor\u2019s statutory authority.\u201d</p><p>His department held a public hearing in January over the proposed rules offered in December by groups such as the Episcopal Farmworker Ministry, North Carolina State AFL-CIO and state NAACP. Most of the people who spoke at the hearing opposed the proposed rules.</p><p>One rule petitioned for focused on controlling the spread of infectious diseases among migrant workers and their dependents, while the other covered workers more broadly in various fields, <a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article286633945.html?tbref=hp\">The News & Observer of Raleigh reported.</a></p><p>The rules would have applied to any airborne infectious disease designated as presenting a public health emergency by the governor, General Assembly or other state or federal agencies. Rules would have required some North Carolina employers to create a written exposure control plan. Some exposure controls include requiring employees to maintain physical distance \u2014 following public health agency recommendations \u2014 or to wear a face mask if that was not possible.</p><p>State AFL-CIO President MaryBe McMillan said her group is \u201cdeeply disappointed by the decision\u201d and urged the department to reconsider, citing worker deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>\"We relied on farm workers, grocery clerks, nurses, letter carriers, and so many other essential workers to provide critical goods and services,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot call workers \u2018essential\u2019 and continue to treat them as expendable.\u201d</p><p>Dobson, in his first term, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-north-carolina-government-and-politics-bd7ce096fc702982134212f3a5d4ff97\">didn't seek reelection this year.</a> GOP nominee Luke Farley and Democratic nominee Braxton Winston will compete for the job in November.</p><p>Winston, a former Charlotte City Council member, spoke in support of the rules at January\u2019s hearing. He said the federal government was not efficient and effective in carrying out its exposure control plans at the start of the pandemic and that the state Labor Department \"must effectively quarterback should the need arise.\u201d</p><p>Farley, who defeated three rivals in last week\u2019s Republican primary, said Dobson's rejection of the proposed rules \"is a win for both our workers and our small businesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you feel sick, don\u2019t go to work. It\u2019s that simple,\" said Farley, a lawyer in construction law. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a bunch of burdensome new regulations to address a commonsense problem.\u201d</p><p>Several of the worker and civil rights groups had sought in late 2020 from the labor department a permanent set of COVID-19 workplace safety standards for workers. The department rejected that petition, but a Wake County judge ruled in 2021 that the agency was wrong to reject it without a formal evaluation, in line with department policy.</p>",
