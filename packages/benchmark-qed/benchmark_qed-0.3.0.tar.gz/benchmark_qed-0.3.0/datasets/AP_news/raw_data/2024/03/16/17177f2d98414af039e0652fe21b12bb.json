Dubbed the \u201cmass siesta,\u201d the event was in commemoration of World Sleep Day.</p><p>It was also meant to be a protest to push for sleep to be considered an essential part of health and wellness.</p><p>Some participants wrapped themselves in bright orange blankets, while others prepped their phones to play soothing music as they slept.</p><p>Among the nappers was 52-year-old mariachi musician Manuel Maga\u00f1a, who was popping in earbuds next to his wife, and 9-year-old daughter, who fell asleep holding hands. Maga\u00f1a heard about the event on the news while he was looking for something fun to do with his granddaughter.</p><p>He said the idea struck a chord with him because as a mariachi he would work long and irregular hours, often going to bed as the sun would come up.</p><p>\u201cAs a musician I work at night, and I rarely sleep well during the day. Sometimes we forget to eat, sometimes all we get is a little nap,\u201d he said.</p><p>The event was organized by the Center for Sleep and Neurosciences and the Mexican Society for the Investigation of Medicine and Sleep (SOMIMS).</p><p>As participants began to drift to sleep, organizers on stage chanted and lead participants through the meditation. They also listed off tips for helping people fall asleep, like getting plenty of natural light during the day and turning their phone off at night.</p><p>Oscar S\u00e1nchez Escand\u00f3n, a director of the event and president of SOMIMS, said the event was meant to highlight \u201csleep inequality\u201d around the world.</p><p>\u201cWe live in a society that is full of economic, social and political commitments, where everything matters other than rest. That can have a strong impact on health,\u201d he said.</p><p>Nearly half of Mexicans are reported to have trouble sleeping, according to a study by the National Autonomous University of Mexico.</p><p>Mexico was listed as the most overworked country in the world by a 2019 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development report, which compared working hours among dozens of countries across the planet.</p><p>Last year, Mexico\u2019s congress debated a proposed reform to officially lower the weekly work hours from 48 \u2013 the average for many Latin American nations \u2013 to 40, standard for much of the world. The initiative was put forward by Mexico\u2019s ruling party, Morena, but the debate got kicked back to 2024.</p><p>Gabriela Filio, a 49-year-old nurse, brought along her 25-year-old daughter with the hopes that Mexico\u2019s younger generations would push for a better work balance.</p><p>\u201cWe are in a country where the paychecks often don\u2019t add up. Sometimes we have to work two jobs, but we also need to make sure to care for our sleep quality,\u201d Filio said, stretching out to take a quick rest.</p>",
