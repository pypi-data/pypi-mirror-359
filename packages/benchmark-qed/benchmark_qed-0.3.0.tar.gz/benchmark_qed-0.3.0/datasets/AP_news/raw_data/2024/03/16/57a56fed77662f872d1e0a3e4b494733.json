Officials are trying to rush food, water and medical supplies to makeshift shelters and other places as gang violence suffocates lives across Port-au-Prince and beyond. Many people are trapped in their homes. Only a handful of aid organizations have been able to restart operations since Feb. 29. That's when gangs began attacking key state institutions and burned police stations. They also stormed the country\u2019s two main prisons and freed more than 4,000 inmates. They've also been firing at the main international airport which remains closed.",

Undeterred, children and adults alike, some of them carrying babies, kept elbowing each other trying to enter.</p><p>\u201cLet us in! We\u2019re hungry!\u201d they shouted on a recent afternoon.</p><p>They were trying to get into a makeshift shelter in an abandoned school. Inside, workers dipped ladles into buckets filled with soup that they poured into Styrofoam containers stuffed with rice to distribute to Haitians who have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gangs-killed-raped-injured-a947708120e8a143d81071adb29bf7ae\">lost homes to gang violence</a>.</p><p>About 1.4 million Haitians are on the verge of famine, and more than <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/un-haiti-humanitarian-food-famine-gang-violence-dc4115ab6d883722ef658e33f15806ba\">4 million require food aid</a>, sometimes eating only once a day or nothing at all, aid groups say.</p><p>\u201cHaiti is facing a protractive and mass hunger,\u201d Jean-Martin Bauer, Haiti director for the United Nations' World Food Program, told The Associated Press. He noted that Croix-des-Bouquets, in the eastern part of Haiti\u2019s capital, \u201chas malnutrition rates comparable with any war zone in the world.\u201d</p><p>Officials are trying to rush food, water and medical supplies to makeshift shelters and other places as gang violence suffocates lives across Port-au-Prince and beyond, with <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/haiti-stranded-foreigners-gangs-a9501bd22ae3269ad011d8c116531646\">many trapped in their homes</a>.</p><p>Only a few aid organizations have been able to restart since Feb. 29, when gangs began attacking key institutions, burning police stations, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/haiti-violence-prison-break-curfew-105ca137aa337b9e6681cf87add9a5c1\">shutting down the main international airport</a> with gunfire and storming two prisons, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/haiti-prison-break-2788f145b0d26efc2aa199e923724e0f\">releasing more than 4,000 inmates</a>.</p><p>The violence forced Prime Minister Ariel Henry to announce early Tuesday that he would <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/haiti-henry-resignation-prime-minister-violence-28acaecc1d80d993c99fe43a5e1e1f7f\">resign once a transitional council is created</a>, but gangs demanding his ouster have continued their attacks in several communities.</p><p>Bauer and other officials said that the gangs are blocking distribution routes and paralyzing the main port, and that WFP's warehouse is running out of grains, beans and vegetable oil as it continues to deliver meals.</p><p>\u201cWe have supplies for weeks. I\u2019m saying weeks, not months,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cThat has me terrified.\u201d</p><p>Inside the makeshift shelter at the school, things were a bit more orderly, with scores of people standing in line for food. More than 3,700 shelter residents compete for a place to sleep and share a hole in the ground for a toilet.</p><p>Marie Lourdes Geneus, a 45-year-old street vendor and mother of seven children, said that gangs chased her family out of three different homes before they ended up at the shelter.</p><p>\u201cIf you look around, there are a lot of desperate people who look like me, who had a life and lost it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible life I\u2019m living. I made a lot of effort in life and look where I end up, trying to survive.\u201d</p><p>She said she occasionally ventures out to sell beans to buy extra food for her children \u2014 who sometimes eat only once a day \u2014 but ends up being <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/haiti-violence-curfew-emergency-gangs-b936625f91ab7c828a212fe46a360c81\">chased by armed men</a>, spilling her goods on the ground as she runs.</p><p>Erigeunes Jeffrand, 54, said that he used to make a living selling up to four wheelbarrow-loads of sugar cane a day, but that gangs recently chased him and his four children out of their neighborhood.</p><p>\u201cMy home was completely destroyed and robbed,\u201d he said. \u201cThey took everything I have. And now, they\u2019re not even letting me work.\u201d</p><p>He sent his two youngest children to live with relatives in Haiti\u2019s more quiet countryside, while the two eldest live with him at the shelter.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe I had a home?\u201d he said. \u201cI was making ends meet. But now, I\u2019m just depending on what people provide me to eat. This is not a life.\"</p><p>More than 200 gangs are believed to operate in Haiti, with nearly two dozen concentrated in Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas. They now control 80% of the capital and are <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gangs-violence-142c57f868c5f8b0cdf01627b3f5350b\">vying for more territory</a>.</p><p>Scores of people have died in the most recent attacks, and more than 15,000 have been left homeless.</p><p>The situation has prevented aid groups like Food for the Hungry from operating at a time when their help is needed the most.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re stuck, with no cash and no capacity to move out what we have in our warehouse,\u201d said Boby Sander, the organization\u2019s Haiti director. \u201cIt\u2019s catastrophic.\u201d</p><p>Food for the Hungry operates a cash-based program that helps about 25,000 families a year by sending them money, but he said that the ongoing looting and attacks on banks have crippled the system.</p><p>\u201cSince Feb. 29, we have not been able to do anything at all,\u201d he said.</p><p>On a recent morning, the fragrance of cooking rice drew a group of adults and teenage boys to a sidewalk near a building where aid workers prepared meals to distribute to shelters elsewhere in the city.</p><p>\u201cCan you help me get a plate of food? We haven\u2019t had anything to eat today yet,\u201d they asked people going in and out of the building. But their pleas went unanswered.

While the document does touch on health indirectly through mentions of malnutrition and the need for medical supplies, the main emphasis is on food insecurity, violence, and the socio-political situation. Therefore, it is somewhat relevant to health but not highly focused on it."
