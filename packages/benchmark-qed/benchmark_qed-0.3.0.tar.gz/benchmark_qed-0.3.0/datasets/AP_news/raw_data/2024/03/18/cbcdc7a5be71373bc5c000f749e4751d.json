The legislation already has passed the House and only needs to clear the Senate this week before being sent to Gov. Brad Little\u2019s desk, where it would likely be signed into law. The Republican governor has said repeatedly he does not believe public funds should be used for gender-affirming care. If the legislation is enacted, the Movement Advancement Project says Idaho would become at least the 10th state to ban Medicaid funding for gender-affirming care for people of all ages.",

Brad Little's desk, where it would likely be signed into law. The Republican governor has said repeatedly he does not believe public funds should be used for gender-affirming care.</p><p>The Senate adjourned Monday before reaching the vote on the bill.</p><p>If the legislation is enacted, Idaho would become at least the 10th state to ban Medicaid funding for gender-affirming care for people of all ages, according to the advocacy and information organization Movement Advancement Project. The laws are part of an ongoing national battle over the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/lgbtq-rights-dont-say-gay-licenses-d0bf9d2f314ec6f28f2189795ea2d56c?utm_source=copy&utm_medium=share\">rights of LGBTQ+ Americans</a>.</p><p>Opponents to the Idaho bill say it almost certainly will lead to a lawsuit in federal court. The state has already been sued multiple times over attempts to deny gender-affirming care to transgender residents and so far has not had much success defending the lawsuits.</p><p>In one case, the state was ordered to provide a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-prisons-lawsuits-idaho-boise-27a48c702b98f34d1036ca1609bc5b41?utm_source=copy&utm_medium=share\">transgender inmate</a> with gender-transition surgery, and the inmate was later awarded roughly $2.5 million in legal fees.</p><p>Last year a federal judge barred Idaho from enforcing its newly enacted ban on <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-health-care-ban-kids-idaho-d17ca5b1549509bb4b21ec26e2691968\">gender-affirming medical care for minors</a> until a lawsuit brought by transgender youth and their families is resolved. A different federal judge denied the state's motion to dismiss a separate lawsuit filed by adults in 2022 who said Medicaid officials wrongly denied coverage for their medically necessary gender-affirming treatment.</p><p>\u201cThis bill violates the 14th Amendment equal protections clause\u201d and the federal Medicaid Act, Boise attorney Howard Belodoff told lawmakers during a hearing on Thursday.</p><p>Belodoff represents the transgender adults who sued the state over what they said were discriminatory Medicaid policies excluding coverage for genital reconstruction surgery.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot distinguish between providing care on the basis of diagnosis, type of illness or condition,\u201d Belodoff said. \u201cThat's exactly what this bill does: it violates the Medicaid Act.\u201d</p><p>One of the bill's sponsors, Republican Rep. Bruce Skaug, said those lawsuits prompted creation of the bill.</p><p>\u201cThis is a taxpayer protection bill in my view,\u201d Skaug said, suggesting that without it the state could end up paying millions for gender-affirming care. Roughly 70% of Idaho's Medicaid program is federally funded.</p><p>Some who testified against the bill suggested it could have a far larger reach than intended by eliminating gender-affirming care for even privately insured residents living in rural areas with only state-funded medical centers.</p><p>Isaac Craghtten, an Idaho Department of Correction employee, noted that many correctional employees work 12- to 16-hour shifts, which can require taking some prescribed medications like hormone therapy while on the job.</p><p>But the legislation bars the use of any state property, facility or building for providing surgical operations or medical interventions, which could mean employees would be subject to criminal penalties for taking their own legally prescribed medication while in a break room, Craghtten said.</p><p>The punishment for violating the law would include fines ranging from $300 to $10,000 and imprisonment between one and 14 years.</p><p>At least 23 states including Idaho have passed laws banning <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/georgia-transgender-care-minors-restrictions-ban-2ac2dc48bc9f98c6f31782ef70d31357?utm_source=copy&utm_medium=share\">gender-affirming care for minors</a>.
