Nor were there significant differences in cognitive and other tests, according to findings published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.</p><p>While that couldn\u2019t rule out some transient injury when symptoms began, researchers said it\u2019s good news that they couldn\u2019t spot long-term markers on brain scans that are typical after trauma or stroke.</p><p>That \u201cshould be some reassurance for patients,\u201d said study co-author Louis French, a neuropsychologist at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center who treats Havana syndrome. \u201cIt allows us to focus on the here and now, to getting people back to where they should be.\u201d</p><p>A subset, about 28%, of Havana syndrome cases were diagnosed with a balance problem called persistent postural-perceptual dizziness, or PPPD. Linked to inner-ear problems as well as severe stress, it results when certain brain networks show no injury but don\u2019t communicate properly. French called it a \u201cmaladaptive response,\u201d much like how people who've slouched to alleviate back pain can have posture trouble even after the pain is gone.</p><p>The Havana syndrome participants reported more fatigue, posttraumatic stress symptoms and depression.</p><p>The findings are the latest in an effort to unravel a mystery that began when personnel at the U.S. embassy in Cuba began seeking medical care for hearing loss and ear-ringing after reporting sudden weird noises.</p><p>Early on, there was concern that Russia or another country may have used some form of directed energy to attack Americans. But last year, U.S. intelligence agencies said there was no sign a foreign adversary was involved and that most cases appeared to have different causes, from undiagnosed illnesses to environmental factors.</p><p>Some patients have accused the government of dismissing their ailments. And in an editorial in JAMA on Monday, one scientist called for more research to prepare for the next such health mystery, cautioning that NIH's study design plus the limits of existing medical technology could have missed some clues.</p><p>\"One might suspect that nothing or nothing serious happened with these cases. This would be ill-advised,\u201d wrote Dr. David Relman of Stanford University. In 2022, he was part of a government-appointed panel that couldn't rule out that a pulsed form of energy could explain a subset of cases.</p><p>The NIH study, which began in 2018 and included more than 80 Havana syndrome patients, wasn\u2019t designed to examine the likelihood of some weapon or other trigger for Havana syndrome symptoms. Chan said the findings don\u2019t contradict the intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusions.</p><p>If some \u201cexternal phenomenon\u201d was behind the symptoms, \u201cit did not result in persistent or detectable pathophysiologic change,\u201d he said.</p><p>The State Department said it was reviewing NIH\u2019s findings but that its priority was ensuring affected employees and family members \u201care treated with respect and compassion and receive timely access to medical care and all benefits to which they are entitled.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
