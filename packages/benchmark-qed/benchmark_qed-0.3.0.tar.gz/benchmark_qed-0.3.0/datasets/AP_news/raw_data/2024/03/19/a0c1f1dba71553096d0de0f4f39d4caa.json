The federal police indictment released Tuesday by the Supreme Court alleged that Bolsonaro and 16 others inserted false information into a public health database to make it appear as though the then-president, his 12-year-old daughter and several others in his circle had received the COVID-19 vaccine. Police detective F\u00e1bio Alvarez Shor, who signed the indictment, said in his report that Bolsonaro and his aides changed their vaccination records in order to cheat health restrictions.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was formally accused Tuesday of falsifying his COVID-19 vaccination status, marking the first indictment for the embattled far-right leader, with more allegations potentially in store.</p><p>The federal police indictment released by the Supreme Court alleged that Bolsonaro and 16 others inserted false information into a public health database to make it appear as though the then-president, his 12-year-old daughter and several others in his circle had received the COVID-19 vaccine.</p><p>Police detective F\u00e1bio Alvarez Shor, who signed the indictment, said in his report that Bolsonaro and his aides changed their vaccination records in order to \u201cissue their respective (vaccination) certificates and use them to cheat current health restrictions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe investigation found several false insertions between November 2021 and December 2022, and also many actions of using fraudulent documents,\u201d Shor added.</p><p>The detective said in the indictment that Bolsonaro\u2019s aide-de-camp, Mauro Cid, told investigators the former president asked him to insert the false data into the system for both himself and his daughter. Cid also said he delivered the vaccination certificates to Bolsonaro personally.</p><p>During the pandemic, Bolsonaro was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-crime-caribbean-health-brazil-80823c6b0d77567d5912373f9d756cbe\">one of the few world leaders who railed against the vaccine</a>. He openly flouted health restrictions and encouraged other Brazilians to follow his example. His administration ignored several offers from pharmaceutical company Pfizer to sell Brazil tens of millions of shots in 2020, and he openly criticized a move by Sao Paulo state\u2019s governor to buy vaccines from Chinese company Sinovac when no other doses were available.</p><p>Brazil\u2019s prosecutor-general\u2019s office will have the final say on whether to use the indictment to file charges against Bolsonaro at the Supreme Court. The case stems from <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/bolsonaro-military-chiefs-testimonies-arrest-fb03d16461fab0d31846d630fb93acc1\">one of several investigations targeting Bolsonaro</a>, who governed from 2019 to 2022.</p><p>Bolsonaro's lawyer, F\u00e1bio Wajngarten, called his client\u2019s indictment \u201cabsurd\u201d and said he did not have access to it.</p><p>\u201cWhen he was president, he was completely exempted from showing any kind of certificate on his trips. This is political persecution and an attempt to void the enormous political capital that has only grown,\u201d Wajngarten said.</p><p>The former president denied any wrongdoing during questioning in May 2023.</p><p>Gleisi Hoffmann, chairwoman of the Workers' Party, whose candidate defeated Bolsonaro, celebrated his indictment on social media. She said she hopes the former president stands trial in many other cases, including for his alleged attempt to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/brazil-bolsonaro-diamonds-saudi-arabia-8e5e516e86d4e025350d03d45ace0c28\">sneak $3 million in diamond jewelry</a> into the country and the sale of two luxury watches he received as gifts from Saudi Arabia while in office.</p><p>\u201cHe has lied until this day about his nefarious administration, but now he will have to face the truth in the courts. The federal police's indictment sent to prosecutors is just the first of several,\u201d Hoffmann said. \u201cWhat is up now, Big Coward? Are you going to face this or run away to Miami?\u201d</p><p>Brazil's Supreme Court has already seized Bolsonaro's passport.</p><p>Police accuse Bolsonaro and his aides of tampering with the health ministry\u2019s database shortly before he traveled to the U.S. in December 2022, two months after he lost his reelection bid to Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.</p><p>Bolsonaro needed a certificate of vaccination to enter the U.S., where he remained for the final days of his term and the first months of Lula\u2019s term. The former president has repeatedly said he has never taken a COVID-19 vaccine.</p><p>If convicted for falsifying health data, the 68-year-old politician could spend up to 12 years behind bars or as little as two years, according to legal analyst Zilan Costa. The maximum jail time for a charge of criminal association is four years, he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat Bolsonaro will argue in this case is whether he did insert the data or enable others to do it, or not. And that is plain and simple: Either you have the evidence or you don't. It is a very serious crime with a very harsh sentence for those convicted,\u201d Costa told The Associated Press.</p><p>Shor also said he is awaiting information from the U.S. Justice Department to \u201cclarify whether those under investigation did make use of the false vaccination certificates upon their arrival and stay in American territory.\u201d</p><p>If so, further charges could be leveled against Bolsonaro, Shor wrote without specifying in which country.</p><p>The indictment sheds new light on a Senate committee inquiry that ended in October 2021 with a recommendation for nine criminal charges against Bolsonaro alleging that he mismanaged the pandemic. Then prosecutor-general Augusto Aras, who was widely seen as a Bolsonaro ally, declined to move the case forward.</p><p>Brazilian media reported that Aras' successor, Paulo Gonet, was scheduled to meet lawmakers later Tuesday to discuss the possibility of filing charges.</p><p>Bolsonaro retains staunch allegiance among his political base, as shown by an outpouring of support last month, when an <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/bolsonaro-brazil-rally-legal-woes-88ba5fdc25bbedc192665f7e95e3cc19\">estimated 185,000 people clogged Sao Paulo's main boulevard</a> to decry what they \u2014 and the former president \u2014 characterize as political persecution.</p><p>The indictment will not turn off his backers and will only confirm his detractors\u2019 suspicions, said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo.</p><p>\u201cIt is definitely worse for him in courts,\u201d Melo said. \u201cHe could be entering a trend of convictions, and then arrest.\u201d</p><p>Brazil\u2019s top electoral court has already ruled Bolsonaro <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/brazil-bolsonaro-ineligible-court-ruling-vote-99dee0fe4b529019ccbb65c9636a9045\">ineligible to run for office until 2030</a>, on the grounds that he abused his power during the 2022 campaign and cast unfounded doubts on the country\u2019s electronic voting system.</p><p>Another investigation relates to his <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/brazil-police-bolsonaro-coup-0999711a3069afde0f7d4e5d32767d2d\">alleged involvement in the Jan. 8, 2023, uprising</a> in the capital of Brasilia, soon after Lula took power. The uprising resembled the U.S. Capitol riot in Washington two years prior. Bolsonaro has denied wrongdoing in both cases.</p><p>Shor wrote that the indictment will be folded into the investigation of Jan. 8, which is being overseen by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. That justice authorized the unsealing of the indictment.</p>",
