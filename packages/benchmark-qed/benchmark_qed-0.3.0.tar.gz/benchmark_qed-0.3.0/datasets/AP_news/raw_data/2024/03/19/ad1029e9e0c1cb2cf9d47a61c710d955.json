    "description_summary": "Michigan lawmakers have given approval to a nine-bill package that will make the state the last in the country to decriminalize surrogacy contracts. Taking part in compensated surrogacy contracts currently could result in a misdemeanor or felony charge punishable by up to one year in jail and a $10,000 fine. The Michigan Senate gave approval Tuesday to a package that will repeal that law and also remove barriers for surrogacy and assisted reproduction methods, including in vitro fertilization services. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer plans to sign the package into law. Multiple families impacted by Michigan\u2019s surrogacy laws spoken out in favor of repealing the 1988 law. That included Tammy Myers, who spent nearly two years trying to adopt her biological twins.",

Instead, it bears the name of a surrogate who carried their daughter due to Lang\u2019s past cancer diagnosis.</p><p>Michigan\u2019s ban on paid surrogacy contracts \u2014 the only state with such a law \u2014 has forced the couple to spend nearly a year trying to adopt their biological daughter.</p><p>State lawmakers voted Tuesday to change that, hoping to make it easier for people like the Langs to more easily be deemed the legal parents of their children born through surrogates.</p><p>\u201cWhenever I fill out paperwork for her, they ask, are you a parent or guardian? And you have to check one box or the other. I don\u2019t know what to check because I am her parent biologically, but legally, I\u2019m her guardian,\u201d said Lang. \u201cSo that just makes me feel very conflicted and very sad about what I am on a piece of paper to her.\u201d</p><p>Michigan is currently the only state in the nation where <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pope-surrogacy-vatican-russia-israel-ukraine-56acaa8500336db81ee18913a77ddc0f\">surrogacy contracts</a> are criminally banned, according to the governor\u2019s office. A 1988 law passed by Republicans makes it a misdemeanor or felony charge to take part in a compensated surrogacy contract.</p><p>An agreement reached between a woman who acts as a surrogate and then hands over parental rights to the child is \u201cvoid and unenforceable,\u201d under the current law. That means the intended parents must go through a judge or the adoption process to gain custody.</p><p>Parents who testified in favor of changing that law say they spent months \u2014 sometimes years \u2014 trying to adopt their child born through a surrogate.</p><p>\u201cDecisions about if, when, and how to have a child are deeply personal. Politicians should not be dictating the terms of these private decisions that should be left to a family, their doctor, and those they love and trust,\u201d said Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in a statement.</p><p>Whitmer, who has said she will sign the package, added that the legislation was vital as \u201cother states make it harder for you to start a family.\u201d The nine-bill package also includes added protections for other assisted reproduction, such as <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ivf-alabama-over-35-cancer-lupus-sickle-cell-8a6e653c79511fc39bbb7c2267941e7a\">in vitro fertilization services</a>, or IVF.</p><p>The package was introduced in a Senate committee just weeks after the Alabama Supreme Court <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alabama-supreme-court-from-embryos-161390f0758b04a7638e2ddea20df7ca\">ruled that</a> frozen embryos can be considered children under state law, which forced some clinics in the state to pause IVF services. Alabama\u2019s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alabama-ivf-frozen-embryos-ruling-cab8171e80c88a088778dc7a187b7b5a\">governor has since</a> signed legislation into law shielding doctors from potential legal liability resulting from the courts ruling.</p><p>In Michigan, Tammy and Jordan Meyers were among those pleading with lawmakers to make the change based on their two-year legal battle.</p><p>The couple in 2021 had sought a pre-birth order for custody of twins they were expecting via gestational carrier. The twins arrived prematurely, before the order\u2019s approval, and a judge denied the couple custody despite the twins being their biological children.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m being honest about it, we missed out on a lot of moments with our babies,\u201d said Tammy Myers. \u201cTime that we should have just been focusing on the babies that arrived safely, despite being eight weeks premature. We weren\u2019t living in the miracle. We were living in the trauma.\u201d</p><p>After a 23-month legal fight, the Myers won the right to adopt their twins in late 2022.</p><p>Tammy Myers watched from the balcony overlooking the Senate chambers on Tuesday as lawmakers considered the package. Prior to the vote, Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks drew attention to Myers, who eventually received a standing ovation from lawmakers.</p><p>\u201cThere is no good reason that parents such as Tammy and Jordan should have to adopt their own babies,\u201d said Brinks.</p><p>Under the bills passed Tuesday, an individual can enter an agreement to become a surrogate if they are at least 21 years old, have previously given birth to a child, undergone medical and mental health exams and have independent legal representation.</p><p>The Michigan Fertility Alliance applauded the Senate\u2019s passage of the bills Tuesday, saying in a statement that it ensures all \u201cchildren born in Michigan by fertility treatments and surrogacy have access to a secure legal relationship with their parents.\u201d</p><p>Several Republicans spoke out against the package of bills on Tuesday prior to the Senate vote, and two Republicans sided with the Democratic majority on all nine of the bills. One Republican, Sen. Thomas Albert, said the bills could \u201copen Pandora\u2019s Box,\u201d and that it \u201cfundamentally redefines the family.\u201d</p><p>Democratic state Sen. Stephanie Chang said during a speech in favor of the bills that they were about \u201cpromoting families\u201d and ensuring \u201cthat Michiganders can fulfill their dreams of parenthood.\u201d</p><p>The Lang family, who is still attempting to adopt their one-year-old, are among those who could potentially grow their family under the new law. In an interview prior to the vote, Rachael Lang said she and her husband felt so broken by the process that they vowed not to try for another child through surrogacy.</p><p>\u201cBut now, you know, if it does go through, we would consider working with a surrogate again,\u201d said Lang.</p>",

            "reason": "The document discusses the legislative changes in Michigan regarding surrogacy contracts, which primarily focuses on legal and social aspects rather than health. While there are mentions of medical procedures like in vitro fertilization (IVF) and the impact of surrogacy on families, the core of the document is about legal reforms and their implications. Therefore, it is only tangentially related to health as it touches on reproductive health services."
