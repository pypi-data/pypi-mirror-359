It was supposed to go into effect in November.</p><p>People could tap into the service as soon as the next several weeks, according to Hochul\u2019s office.</p><p>In New York, trained pharmacists will be able to hand out self-administered hormonal contraceptives including oral birth control pills, vaginal rings, and the patch, even if the patients don't have prescriptions.</p><p>Pharmacists who want to participate need to complete training developed by the state Education Department before they can dispense up to a 12-month supply of a contraceptive of the individual's preference.</p><p>Patients must fill out a self-screening form to help pharmacists identify the appropriate contraceptive as well as potential risks associated with the medication. Pharmacists will also be required to notify the patient's primary health care practitioner within 72 hours of dispensing the medication.</p><p>Opill will still be available on store shelves and can be purchased by American women and teens just as easily as they buy Ibuprofen.</p><p>___</p><p>Maysoon Khan is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative. <a href=\"https://www.reportforamerica.org/\">Report for America</a> is a nonprofit national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on undercovered issues.</p>",
