But there was a problem, according to a Federal Police indictment: Bolsonaro didn\u2019t have the necessary vaccination certificate required by U.S. authorities. So Bolsonaro allegedly turned to his aide-de-camp and asked him to insert false data into the public health system to make it appear as though he and his 12-year-old daughter had received the COVID-19 vaccine. Cid told police he printed out the certificates and hand-delivered them to Bolsonaro, according to detective F\u00e1bio Alvarez Shor.",

A separate indictment for criminal association carries a maximum jail time of four years, he said.</p><p>Bolsonaro, who didn't comment on Tuesday, previously denied any wrongdoing during questioning in May 2023.</p><p>In addition to the allegation Bolsonaro falsified records, another ongoing investigation seeks to determine whether <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/brazil-bolsonaro-diamonds-saudi-arabia-8e5e516e86d4e025350d03d45ace0c28\">he tried to sneak two sets of expensive diamond jewelry into Brazil</a> and prevent them from being incorporated into the presidency\u2019s public collection. Police are also probing his alleged involvement in the Jan. 8, 2023 uprising in the capital, soon after Lula took power. It resembled the U.S. Capitol riot in Washington two years prior and sought to restore Bolsonaro to power. Commanders who served under Bolsonaro have told police <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/bolsonaro-military-chiefs-testimonies-arrest-fb03d16461fab0d31846d630fb93acc1\">the former leader presented them with a plan for him to remain in power</a> after he lost his 2022 reelection bid.</p><p>But it is <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-crime-caribbean-health-brazil-80823c6b0d77567d5912373f9d756cbe\">his actions during the COVID-19 pandemic</a> \u2013 which he called \u201ca measly cold\u201d as he brazenly flouted health restrictions and encouraged Brazilians to follow his example \u2013 that may have caught up with him first. After vaccines became available, he dismissed them as unnecessary, despite Brazil registering one of the highest death tolls in the world, and repeatedly said he would not receive a jab himself.</p><p>His administration ignored several offers from pharmaceutical company Pfizer to sell Brazil tens of millions of shots in 2020, and he openly criticized a move by Sao Paulo state\u2019s governor to buy vaccines from Chinese company Sinovac when no other doses at hand.</p><p>Bolsonaro wasn't the only one indicted on Tuesday: Cid and 15 others were accused of involvement in the scheme to falsify records for themselves and others.</p><p>\u201cThe former president never ordered or knew that any of his advisors had produced vaccination certificates with ideologically false content,\u201d three of Bolsonaro\u2019s lawyers said in a statement released late Tuesday. \u201cWhen he entered the U.S. at the end of December 2022, he was not asked for a vaccination certificate since, as President of the Republic, he was exempt from this requirement.\u201d</p><p>Shor, the police detective, wrote in his indictment he is awaiting information from the U.S. Justice Department to \u201cclarify whether those under investigation did make use of the false vaccination certificates upon their arrival and stay in American territory.\u201d If so, further charges could be leveled against Bolsonaro, Shor wrote without specifying in which country.</p><p>His indictment breathed fresh life into a Senate committee inquiry that ended in October 2021 with a recommendation for nine criminal charges against Bolsonaro, alleging that he mismanaged the pandemic. Then prosecutor-general Augusto Aras, who was widely seen as a Bolsonaro ally, declined to move the case forward.</p><p>Aras\u2019 successor, Paulo Gonet, met committee members Tuesday night. They requested that he reopen investigations stemming from their monthslong work that were shelved, and stressed the importance of carrying forward those already underway, according to a statement from the office of Sen. Omar Aziz, who chaired the committee.</p><p>Bolsonaro retains staunch allegiance among his political base, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/bolsonaro-brazil-rally-legal-woes-88ba5fdc25bbedc192665f7e95e3cc19\">as shown by an outpouring of support last month,</a> when an estimated 185,000 people clogged Sao Paulo\u2019s main boulevard to decry what they \u2014 and the former president \u2014 characterize as political persecution.</p><p>The indictment will not turn off his backers and will only confirm his detractors\u2019 suspicions, said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo.</p><p>\u201cIt is definitely worse for him in courts,\u201d Melo said. \u201cHe could be entering a trend of convictions, and then arrest.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/brazil-bolsonaro-ineligible-court-ruling-vote-99dee0fe4b529019ccbb65c9636a9045\">Brazil\u2019s top electoral court has already ruled Bolsonaro ineligible to run for office until 2030</a>, on the grounds that he abused his power during the 2022 campaign and cast unfounded doubts on the country\u2019s electronic voting system.</p><p>After losing the October 2022 election, he never conceded defeat. And with a fresh vaccination certificate in hand, according to the police indictment, he decamped for south Florida.</p><p>___ Savarese reported from Sao Paulo.</p>",
