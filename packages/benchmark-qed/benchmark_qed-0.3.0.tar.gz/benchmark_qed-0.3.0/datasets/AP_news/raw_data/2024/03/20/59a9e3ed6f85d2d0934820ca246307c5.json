His signature \u201cOne, two, three, four\u201d was the only thing that separated most songs, showing no signs of his illness from the previous year. Once he shouted, \u201cGood evening, Arizona\u201d the show was off and running.</p><p>Springsteen spoke to the crowd briefly about his illness prior to playing his final song \u201cI\u2019ll See You In My Dreams\u201d solo on stage. \u201cPhoenix, first I want to apologize if there was any discomfort because we had to move the show last time. . . . I hope we didn\u2019t inconvenience you too much.\u201d</p><p>The 29-song show came in just under three hours, but \u201cThe Boss\u201d hardly broke a sweat while showing off a strong voice, all the while dancing, tearing into guitar solos, playing the harmonica and even ripping his shirt open near the end of the show.</p><p>On stage with Springsteen was the legendary E Street Band which features drummer Max Weinberg, bassist Garry Tallent, keyboardists Roy Bittan and Charlie Giordano, guitarists Stevie Van Zandt and Nils Lofgren, saxophonist Jake Clemons \u2014 nephew of original and still missed sax man Clarence Clemons who died in 2011 \u2014 guitarist and violin player Soozie Tyrell, a full horn and brass section and four backup vocalists. The only missing member of the band was Springsteen\u2019s wife, singer and guitarist Patti Scialfa.</p><p>Springsteen performed most of the hits in his vast collection, minus \u201cBorn In The U.S.A.,\u201d but he added covers \u201cNightshift\u201d by the Commodores, \u201cBecause The Night\u201d by Patti Smith Group, and a surprise: \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d by The Beatles. Fans went wild for \u201cNo Surrender,\u201d \u201cBorn To Run,\u201d \u201cRosalita,\u201d \u201cDancing In The Dark,\u201d \u201cGlory Days\u201d and \u201cTenth Avenue Freeze-Out\" that left the rocker grinning from ear-to-ear as he conducted fans singing along like his own chorus.</p><p>This year has been particularly challenging for Springsteen. In addition to his health issues, in January his mother, Adele Ann Springsteen, a fan favorite who could frequently be seen dancing at his shows, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/bruce-springsteen-mother-adele-zerilli-dead-c8f80a93a887425fbd1884ee53339951\">died</a>. She was 98.</p><p>Two days after her death, Springsteen performed at <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jon-bon-jovi-grammys-musicares-person-year-0fdd5f891fe102a49110820a8d095913\">the 2024 MusiCares Person of the Year</a> event, which honored Jon Bon Jovi for his musical achievements and philanthropic efforts.</p><p>The 2024 edition of the tour kicked off in Phoenix and ends Nov. 22 in Vancouver, Canada. It hits 17 countries across 52 dates, including a special performance on Sept. 15 where Springsteen will headline the Sea.Hear.Now Festival in his hometown of Asbury Park, New Jersey.</p>",
