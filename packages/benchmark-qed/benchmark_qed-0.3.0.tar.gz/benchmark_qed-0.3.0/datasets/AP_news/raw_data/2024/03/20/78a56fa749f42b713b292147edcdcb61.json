    "description_summary": "A Nevada judge has ordered the state to grant Medicaid coverage for abortions without any restrictions. Clark County District Judge Erika Ballou in Las Vegas said from the bench on Tuesday that she plans to issue a written order. The state could appeal the judge's ruling but declined to comment on its plans. Nevada's Medicaid program currently only covers abortions for pregnancies that are life-threatening or result from rape or incest. The judge says she agreed with civil rights advocates that the coverage restrictions violated equal rights protections. Seventeen states already allow Medicaid coverage for abortions, including neighboring California and Oregon. Nevada law grants the right to an abortion up to 24 weeks.",

Wade</a> and stripped away federal abortion protections.</p><p>Ballou, however, acknowledged that it's likely her ruling will be appealed. A spokesperson for the Nevada attorney general\u2019s office declined to comment on the ruling and whether the state plans to request a stay on the order amid an appeal.</p><p>The Nevada ruling also comes on the heels of a Pennsylvania high court decision in January that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-abortion-391844f5b4d9b197400abe8803280133\">revived a yearslong legal battle</a> challenging restrictions there on Medicaid coverage for abortions.</p><p>Seventeen states currently allow Medicaid to pay for abortions, including Nevada's neighbors California and Oregon, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/interactive-how-state-policies-shape-access-to-abortion-coverage/\">according to KFF</a>.</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, which led the effort resulting in Tuesday's ruling, applauded the judge's decision.</p><p>\u201cEvery person, regardless of their income level or insurance source, deserves the power to make personal medical decisions during pregnancy, including abortion,\u201d staff attorney Rebecca Chan said in a statement.</p><p>In 2022, the same year that Roe v. Wade was overturned, Nevada voters passed a sweeping version of the Equal Rights Amendment, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-nevada-discrimination-gender-identity-constitutions-a8aa384a6a21c224408cd9603b1b77ce\">adding protections</a> to the state's constitution against discrimination based on sex.</p><p>ACLU lawyers argued that Nevada's limitations on Medicaid abortion coverage violates the ERA, because the restrictions disproportionately discriminate against poor people and people of color.</p><p>Meanwhile, the state attorney general's office sought to have the case dismissed on procedural grounds, according to legal filings.</p><p>In Nevada, the right to terminate a pregnancy up to 24 weeks is protected by state law.</p>",
