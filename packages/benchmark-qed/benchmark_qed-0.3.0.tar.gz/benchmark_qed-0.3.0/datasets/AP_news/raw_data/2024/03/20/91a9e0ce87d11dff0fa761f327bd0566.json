The Republican former president has taken credit for overturning abortion rights in America by appointing three U.S. Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that had established the constitutional protection for abortion. But as Trump seeks the White House again, he has until now refrained from embracing any specific limit on abortion, warning it can backfire politically. But in a radio interview Tuesday, Trump said \u201cPeople are agreeing on 15\" and he's \"thinking in terms of that.\u201d",

Wade. As he seeks the White House a third time, Trump has refrained from embracing any specific limit on the procedure, warning it could backfire politically and instead suggesting he would \u201cnegotiate\u201d a policy on abortion that would include exceptions for cases of rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother.</p><p>But in a radio interview Tuesday, Trump criticized Democrats for not endorsing a ban that would limit abortions in states that still allow the procedure.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to come up with a time \u2014 and maybe we could bring the country together on that issue,\" Trump said while calling into the \u201cSid & Friends in the Morning\u201d show on WABC.</p><p>Trump went on to say: \u201cThe number of weeks now, people are agreeing on 15. And I\u2019m thinking in terms of that. And it\u2019ll come out to something that\u2019s very reasonable. But people are really, even hard-liners are agreeing, seems to be, 15 weeks seems to be a number that people are agreeing at.\"</p><p>At the same time, Trump seemed to suggest reluctance to a federal ban.</p><p>\u201cEverybody agrees \u2014 you\u2019ve heard this for years \u2014 all the legal scholars on both sides agree: It\u2019s a state issue. It shouldn\u2019t be a federal issue, it\u2019s a state issue,\u201d he said.</p><p>Last month, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-federal-ban-trump-2024-election-61c3edcd3780ce94be3bd8d65f100f23\">Trump\u2019s campaign dismissed reports</a> that he privately had expressed for a ban on abortion after 16 weeks of pregnancy, calling the report \u201cfake news.\u201d The campaign did not offer details on Trump\u2019s plans, only saying he planned to \u201cnegotiate a deal\u201d on abortion.</p><p>Later Tuesday, after casting his ballot in Florida's Republican presidential primary, Trump was asked by a reporter about a ban on abortions at 16 weeks and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be talking about that soon.\u201d</p><p>Abortion rights have been a galvanizing issue for voters in recent years, and Democrats and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-kamala-harris-abortion-c634452da5e103913982e1cc5a0cae78\">President Joe Biden's campaign are preparing</a> to spotlight the issue as a clear split from Trump in the 2024 election.</p><p>Polling has consistently shown that most Americans believe abortion should be legal through the initial stages of pregnancy. About half of U.S. adults said abortions should be permitted at the 15-week mark, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted last June.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Jill Colvin in New York contributed to this report.</p>",
