    "description_summary": "A Dutch court says the government has systematically put the interests of the aviation sector above those of people who live near Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport. The Hague District Court ruled Wednesday that the treatment of local residents amounts to a breach of Europe\u2019s human rights convention. The court has ordered authorities to do more to rein in noise pollution. The court ruling is the latest development in long-running efforts to rein in noise pollution and nuisance caused by the airport on the outskirts of Amsterdam. Last year the government shelved plans to rein in flights following protests from countries including the United States.",

Late last year, the government <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/schiphol-flights-reduction-scrapped-fb284758c580d7d24d544f4760c3f605?utm_source=copy&utm_medium=share\">shelved plans to rein in flights</a> following protests from countries including the United States and warnings that the move could breach European law and aviation agreements.</p><p>\u201cThe judge\u2019s decision is crystal clear: more attention must be paid to local residents and the reduction of noise pollution. That was already the government\u2019s commitment, and we will study the verdict,\u201d the ministry for infrastructure and water said in a written response.</p><p>The national public health institute estimates that around 259,000 people in the Netherlands experience \u201cserious nuisance\u201d from aircraft flying over the densely populated country.</p><p>Wednesday's court ruling ordered the government to properly enforce existing noise pollution laws and regulations within a year and to provide \u201cpractical and effective legal protection for all people who experience serious inconvenience or sleep disturbance due to air traffic to and from Schiphol.\u201d</p><p>The organization that brought the case, called The Right to Protection from Aircraft Nuisance, welcomed the ruling.</p><p>\u201cThe court ruled that the state did not properly weigh interests: economic interests have always been central, local residents were lowest in the pecking order. That is no longer allowed,\u201d it said, adding that the group and its lawyers were \u201cextremely satisfied\u201d with the decision.</p><p>Schiphol said in a statement that it is working toward reducing noise pollution</p><p>\u201cLike these local residents, we want aviation to cause less nuisance. At the same time, we want the Netherlands to remain connected to the rest of the world, but quieter, cleaner and better,\u201d the airport said in a written statement.</p><p>Among measures the airport is proposing are closing at nighttime and banning the noisiest planes.</p><p>\u201cThis will lead to a reduction in the number of people experiencing noise nuisance. In the short term, it is in any case important to have legislation that gives clarity to both local residents and the aviation sector. That is also the judge\u2019s verdict today,\u201d Schiphol added.</p>",

While it touches on public health concerns related to noise pollution, the main focus is on legal and regulatory aspects rather than health itself. The mention of the national public health institute's estimate of people experiencing 'serious nuisance' from aircraft noise is relevant but not central to the document's main narrative."
