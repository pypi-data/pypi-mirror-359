The princess had surgery at the clinic in central London on Jan. 16 and was discharged almost two weeks later.</p><p>Kensington Palace, the office of Kate and husband Prince William, said that the report was \u201ca matter for the London Clinic.\u201d</p><p>Al Russell, the hospital's chief executive, said Wednesday that \u201call appropriate investigatory, regulatory and disciplinary steps will be taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no place at our hospital for those who intentionally breach the trust of any of our patients or colleagues,\" he said in a statement.</p><p>Health Minister Maria Caulfield said that police had been asked to look into the matter.</p><p>\u201cWhether they take action is a matter for them,\u201d she told LBC radio.</p><p>\u201cBut the Information Commissioner can also take prosecutions,\u201d she added. \u201cSo there are particularly hefty implications if you are looking at notes for medical records that you should not be looking at.\u201d</p><p>The clinic in London's Marylebone neighborhood, less than two miles (around three kilometers) from Buckingham Palace, has treated several members of the royal family over the decades. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/king-charles-iii-cancer-britain-e0408a7c9bb86ad2af8754ce4b37d65e\">King Charles III</a> spent a weekend there in January undergoing a procedure to treat an enlarged prostate. Soon after, the palace said that doctors had diagnosed the king with an unspecified form of cancer.</p><p>Charles, 75, was withdrawn from public duties while he has cancer treatment \u2014 a period that has coincided with Kate's disappearance from public view.</p><p>Kensington Palace has given little detail about Kate\u2019s condition beyond saying that it isn't cancer-related, the surgery was successful and recuperation will keep the princess away from public duties until April.</p><p>Even though that time hasn't yet elapsed, the princess\u2019 absence from public view has fueled a tide of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/princess-kate-photo-royals-media-2470c605dcc9766748bab82d8683e02b\">speculation, rumor and conspiracy theories</a>.</p><p>On March 10, William and Kate\u2019s Kensington Palace office released a photo of Kate and her children George, Charlotte and Louis to coincide with Mother\u2019s Day in the U.K. The move backfired when <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/princess-wales-kate-surgery-photo-manipulated-3863e9ac78aec420a91e4f315297c348\">The Associated Press</a> and other news agencies retracted the picture from publication, because it appeared to have been manipulated, fueling even more conjecture.</p><p>Kate <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/princess-kate-manipulated-photo-482fda64281b4a63ccf30364d96b2622\">issued a statement</a> acknowledging that she liked to \u201cexperiment with editing\u201d and apologizing for \u201cany confusion\u201d the photo had caused.</p><p>The gossip hasn't been quieted by footage published by The Sun and TMZ that appears to show Kate and husband Prince William visiting a farm shop near their Windsor home on the weekend. The video sparked a new flurry of rumor-mongering, with some armchair sleuths refusing to believe the video showed Kate at all.</p><p>Nelson Silva, a local resident who said he shot the footage, told The Sun that conspiracy theorists are \u201cdelusional.\"</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so much shocked that these comments have continued, I\u2019m just confused how exactly they can continue,\" he was quoted as saying. \u201cThis is a video clearly showing her and William. I saw them with my own eyes.\"</p>",

While it does touch on health-related aspects such as her abdominal surgery and recuperation, the main emphasis is on the privacy and security issues rather than health itself. The document also delves into the public and media reaction to her absence and a manipulated photo, which are not directly related to health. Therefore, the document is somewhat relevant but not highly focused on health as a primary topic."
