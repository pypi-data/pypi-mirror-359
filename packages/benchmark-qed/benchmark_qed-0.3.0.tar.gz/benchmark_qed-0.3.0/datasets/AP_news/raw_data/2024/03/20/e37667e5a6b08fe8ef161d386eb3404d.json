The agencies are referring to \u201ce-waste,\u201d which is defined as discarded devices with a plug or battery, including cellphones, electronic toys, TVs, microwave ovens, e-cigarettes, laptop computers and solar panels. It does not include waste from electronic vehicles. In a new report released Wednesday, the U.N.\u2019s International Telecommunications Union and research arm UNITAR said nearly 62 million tons of \u201ce-waste\u201d was generated in 2022. They said some contained hazardous elements like mercury, as well as rare Earth metals coveted by tech companies. It\u2019s on track to reach 82 million tons by 2030.",

It does not include waste from electronic vehicles, which fall into a separate category.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.unitar.org/about/news-stories/press/global-e-waste-monitor-2024-electronic-waste-rising-five-times-faster-documented-e-waste-recycling\">report released Wednesday</a>, the U.N.\u2019s International Telecommunications Union and research arm UNITAR said some 62 million tons of \u201ce-waste\u201d was generated in 2022, enough to fill tractor-trailers that could be lined up bumper to bumper around the globe. It\u2019s on track to reach 82 million tons by 2030.</p><p>Metals \u2014 including copper, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/c8addaa3f9034f899f864d3db5a76156\">gold</a> and iron \u2014 made up half of the 62 million tons, worth a total of some $91 billion, the report said. Plastics accounted for 17 million tons and the remaining 14 million tons include substances like composite materials and glass.</p><p>The U.N. says 22% of the e-waste mass was properly collected and recycled in 2022. It is expected to fall to 20% by the end of the decade because of \u201cstaggering growth\" of such waste due to higher consumption, limited repair options, shorter product life cycles, growing \u201celectronification\u201d of society, and inadequate e-waste management infrastructure, the agencies said.</p><p>They said some of the discarded electronic devices contained hazardous elements like mercury, as well as rare Earth metals coveted by tech industry manufacturers. Currently, only 1% of the demand for the 17 minerals that make up the rare metals is met through recycling.</p><p>About half of all e-waste is generated in Asia, where few countries have laws on e-waste or collection targets, according to the report. Recycling and collection rates top 40% in Europe, where per-capita waste generation is highest: nearly 18 kilograms (39 pounds).</p><p>In Africa, which generates the least of any of the five big global regions, recycling and collection rates hover at about 1%, it said.</p><p>\u201cThe latest research shows that the global challenge posed by e-waste is only going to grow,\u201d said Cosmas Luckyson Zavazava, head of the ITU telecommunication development bureau. \u201cWith less than half of the world implementing and enforcing approaches to manage the problem, this raises the alarm for sound regulations to boost collection and recycling.\u201d</p><p>For some, e-waste represents a way to earn cash by rummaging through trash in the developing world to find coveted commodities, despite the health risks.</p><p>At the Dandora dumpsite where garbage collected from the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/1fb90dd036384063aff2ddc0c8ff09ec\">Kenyan</a> capital of Nairobi ends up \u2014 even though a court declared it full over a generation ago \u2014 scavengers try to earn a living by picking through rubbish for e-waste that can be sold to businesses as recycled material.</p><p>Steve Okoth hopes the flow continues so he can eke out an income, but he knows the risks.</p><p>\u201cWhen the e-waste comes here, it contains some powder which affects my health,\" he said, adding that when electronic devices heat up, they release gases and he \u201ccan\u2019t come to work because of chest problems.\u201d</p><p>However, Okoth said they don't have any other options: \"We are now used to the smoke because if you don\u2019t go to work you will not eat.\u201d</p><p>Recycling plants, like Nairobi\u2019s WEEE center, have collection points across Kenya, where people can safely get rid of old electric equipment.</p><p>\u201cWe take inventory of the items,\" said Catherine Wasolia, WEEE's chief operating officer, to check for data on submitted devices and wipe them clean. Then they test each to assess if \"it can be reused or repurposed.\u201d</p><p>E-waste expert George Masila worries about the impact of electronic waste on soil.</p><p>\u201cWhen you have all this e-waste \u2014 either in the dumpsites or mercilessly deposited anywhere else \u2014 it could have major effects on the soil,\" Masila said. \"Every year it rains and water flows and attracts all these elements that are deposited into the environment. You have water getting contaminated.\u201d</p><p>He said greater recycling and re-use of such materials, \"are some of the things we should be considering.\u201d</p><p>Report authors acknowledged that many people in the developing world pay their bills through harvesting such e-waste, and called for them to be trained and equipped to make such work safer.</p><p>\u201cWe must try to support these people trying to find their niche,\u201d said Ruediger Kuehr, senior manager of the sustainable cycles program at UNITAR.</p><p>__</p><p>Keaten reported from Geneva.</p>",

While it does touch upon health risks associated with e-waste, such as the hazardous elements in discarded electronics and the health problems faced by scavengers, the main emphasis is on environmental and regulatory aspects rather than health. Therefore, the document is somewhat relevant to the topic of health but not highly focused on it."
