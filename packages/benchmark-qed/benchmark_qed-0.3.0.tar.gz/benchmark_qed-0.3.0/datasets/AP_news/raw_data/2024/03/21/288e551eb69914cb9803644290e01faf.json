The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued new gudiance that says Medicare Part D drug benefit plans can cover anti-obesity drugs as long as they're approved for an additional use. The guidance opens the door to wider coverage of Wegovy, which was approved to prevent the risk of heart attack, stroke and other serious heart problems in patients who are overweight or have obesity. Research showed that Wegovy cut the risk of those problems by 20% in such patients.",

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration this month <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wegovy-semaglutide-heart-attack-stroke-fda-label-ccbc1fc44ee43f8536596d5f7bbd6876\">approved a label change</a> that allows Wegovy to be used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in people who are overweight or have obesity and also have existing heart disease.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wegovy-semaglutide-obesity-heart-disease-8721279813feabce46ac0cb9cd600a59\">Recent research</a> showed that Wegovy cut the risk of heart attack, stroke and other problems by 20% versus a placebo, or dummy drug, in such patients. Cardiologists and other experts said use of semaglutide to reduce the risk of often fatal or disabling conditions could change the way heart patients are treated.</p><p>Wegovy carries a price tag of more than $1,300 a month, or $16,000 per year.</p><p>Part D plans could begin covering the drug \u201csome time this year,\u201d said Tricia Neuman, a Medicare policy specialist at KFF, a nonprofit that researches health policy.</p><p>\u201cMedicare plans may be reluctant to move quickly to cover Wegovy given its relatively high price, particularly because they won\u2019t be able to adjust premiums before next year,\u201d she said.</p><p>Even if plans do allow coverage, people who meet the criteria may still face other restrictions. Plans may require higher out-of-pocket fees, prior authorizations or step therapy, in which a patient is required to try a lower-cost drug before proceeding to the new treatment, Neuman said.</p><p>Medicare Part D plans are prohibited by law from covering obesity medications used for chronic weight management alone, and that would not change, CMS officials said.</p><p>Private insurers are evaluating the guidance \u2014 and the new indication for Wegovy \u2014 before making coverage decisions, said a spokesperson for AHIP, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group.</p><p>Drugmakers and obesity advocates have been pushing for expanded coverage, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wegovy-ozempic-zepbound-medicare-obesity-weight-loss-02d4500e737d30d070d70907521a4fe0\">including legislation</a> that would require Medicare to pay for the obesity drugs.</p><p>At issue has been whether the cost of the expensive medications will be offset by the savings of reduced spending on medical care related to obesity \u2014 and, now, heart disease.</p><p>One lingering obstacle to broader use is limited supply of the drug, which has been <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wegovy-ozempic-mounjaro-shortage-insurance-64014bc2887a518b33c597b2bf936e37\">in shortage</a> for more than a year, according to the FDA. Novo Nordisk officials say they\u2019re working to increase production and access.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
