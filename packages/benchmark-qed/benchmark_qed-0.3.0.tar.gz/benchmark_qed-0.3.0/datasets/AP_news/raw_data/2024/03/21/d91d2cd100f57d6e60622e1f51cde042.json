Ivan Zhdanov, head of the Anti-Corruption Foundation that was started by Navalny, said the court in the town of Labytnangi, near the Arctic prison where he died, turned down the suit because it said only Navalny himself could be the plaintiff. \u201cAlexei filed claims against the colonies many times for failure to provide medical care. The claims were denied. Now that he was killed, his family\u2019s claim is being denied with mocking wording,\u201d Zhdanov said on the Telegram messaging app.",
