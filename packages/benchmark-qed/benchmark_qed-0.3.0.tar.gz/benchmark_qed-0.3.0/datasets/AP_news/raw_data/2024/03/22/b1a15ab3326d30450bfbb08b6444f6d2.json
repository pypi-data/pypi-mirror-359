    "description_summary": "Republican lawmakers are pushing Gov. Josh Shapiro\u2019s administration to do more to investigate the deaths of older adults who are possibly being abused or neglected. The push comes after Pennsylvania recorded a more-than-tenfold increase in such deaths in recent years. Shapiro\u2019s Department of Aging is balking at the idea raised by Republican lawmakers to gather cause of death information. Rep. Seth Grove of York County said Friday that getting that information can help figure out how to better protect older adults. Secretary of Aging Jason Kavulich says neither the department nor county-level agencies have the \u201clegal authority\u201d to access the information. Grove questions that, since death certificates are public record.",

Josh Shapiro's administration to do more to investigate the deaths of older adults who are the subject of an abuse or neglect complaint after Pennsylvania <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/older-adult-deaths-abuse-neglect-pennsylvania-covid-c9e76aa9852dc1071eb5190e5961d391\">recorded a steep increase</a> in such deaths, starting in 2019.</p><p>Shapiro's Department of Aging has balked at the idea raised by Republican lawmakers, who have pressed the department, or the county-level agencies that investigate abuse or neglect complaints, to gather cause of death information from death records.</p><p>Getting more information about the cause of death is a first step, Rep. Seth Grove, R-York, the ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, said in an interview Friday.</p><p>\u201cSo you have the information, and then the next step is what do we do to protect them, to make sure they\u2019re not on a fatality list somewhere,\u201d Grove said. \"That\u2019s that next step, which is the important aspect. We need to get to it.\"</p><p>In a House Appropriations Committee hearing last month, Rep. John Lawrence, R-Chester, told Shapiro\u2019s Secretary of Aging Jason Kavulich that it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d that the department isn't already gathering that information when someone dies.</p><p>\u201cThese folks end up dead after someone reported them as being vulnerable and ... your agency is telling the press, 'well, we really don\u2019t know. We really can\u2019t explain. Maybe they died of abuse or neglect. We didn\u2019t really ask,'\u201d Lawrence told Kavulich.</p><p>Kavulich told Lawrence that the department is \u201ccollecting the data that the law has told us we need to.\"</p><p>Kavulich followed up in recent days with a letter to the House Appropriations Committee that noted caseworkers are supposed to contact the county coroner in cases where there is reason to suspect that the older adult died from abuse.</p><p>But Kavulich also wrote that neither the department nor the county-level agencies have the \u201clegal authority\u201d to access cause of death information.</p><p>Grove questioned that, saying death certificates are public record and that the department or county caseworkers should be able to request the information from a coroner or a health department.</p><p>In a statement, Lawrence called Kavulich's written response \u201can incoherent word salad that casts blame in every direction but fails to take any responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt gives me great pause that I cannot get a simple answer to a simple question \u2014 why aren\u2019t you asking why these seniors died?\u201d Lawrence wrote.</p><p>If the state attorney general's office is not already looking into the matter, it should launch an investigation tomorrow, Lawrence wrote.</p><p>Lawmakers raised questions since Pennsylvania recorded a more than tenfold increase in the deaths of older adults following an abuse or neglect complaint, from 120 in 2017 to 1,288 last year. They peaked at 1,389 in 2022.</p><p>The department does not typically make the deaths data public and released it in response to a request by The Associated Press.</p><p>The increase came as COVID-19 ravaged the nation, the number of complaints grew and agencies struggled to keep caseworkers on staff.</p><p>The Department of Aging has suggested the data could be misleading since the deaths may have had nothing to do with the original abuse or neglect complaint.</p><p>Department and county-level agency officials have speculated the increase could be attributed to a growing population of people 65 and older, an increase in complaints and the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults.</p><p>It\u2019s not clear whether better data collection also helped explain the increase, but evidence suggests that other similar jurisdictions \u2014 such as Michigan and Illinois \u2014 did not see such a steep increase.</p><p>The broader death rate of older adults did not increase nearly as steeply during the pandemic, going from about 4% of those 65 and older in 2018 to 4.5% in 2021, according to federal statistics.</p><p>The department has contracts with 52 county-level \u201carea agencies for aging\u201d to investigate abuse or neglect complaints and coordinate with doctors, service providers and if necessary, law enforcement.</p><p>Most calls involve someone who lives alone or with a family member or caregiver. Poverty is often a factor.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Marc Levy at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/timelywriter\">http://twitter.com/timelywriter</a>.</p>",
