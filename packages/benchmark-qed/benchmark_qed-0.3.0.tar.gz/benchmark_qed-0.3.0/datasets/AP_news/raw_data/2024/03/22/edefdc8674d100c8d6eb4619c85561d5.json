    "description_summary": "Kate, the Princess of Wales, has disclosed that she has cancer but hasn't said what kind. In a video announcement Friday, she revealed that she was undergoing chemotherapy but didn't give further details of her treatment. Kate had successful abdominal surgery in January. At the time, officials said her condition wasn\u2019t cancerous. But Kate says tests done later found the cancer. Kensington Palace said that no details about her cancer or her treatment would be released, saying she has a right to medical privacy. After successful surgery, chemotherapy is often used to help kill any stray cancer cells and to prevent the cancer from coming back.",

The news wasn't announced until the next day, when Kensington Palace <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kate-princess-of-wales-operation-uk-royals-eea1a111a295152b8820b94fd257c12d\">revealed</a> that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kate-middleton-princess-wales-britain-photos-2a53e8ed0cb5107ada54461d61ffd964\">Kate</a> was recovering from a planned operation.</p><p>At the time, officials said her condition wasn't cancerous but did not specify what kind of surgery, saying only that it was successful.</p><hl2>When was Kate's cancer found?</hl2><p>During the video announcement Friday, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kate-middleton-princess-wales-profile-cancer-6060f1d86cbba06eea8404d0f3c8b6cb\">Kate</a> said: \u201cTests after the operation found cancer had been present,\u201d and that she was in the early stages of treatment.</p><p>She didn't say what kind of cancer was found, nor did she give details of her chemotherapy. The statement from Kensington Palace said Kate found out about the cancer after post-surgery tests were done.</p><hl2>Is it unusual to find cancer after surgery?</hl2><p>While it's rare to find cancer after surgery for a noncancerous problem, it does happen in about 4% of such surgeries, said Dr. Yuman Fong, a surgeon at City of Hope cancer center in Southern California.</p><p>\u201cThat 4% figure represents someone who\u2019s going to the operating room for what is thought to be benign disease\u201d such as a procedure to remove the gallbladder or ovarian cysts, Fong said.</p><hl2>Is it unusual to find cancer in someone so young?</hl2><p>Yes, cancer is rare in young adults. But in developed countries, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9406462/\">rates of some cancers are rising</a> among younger adults.

Treatments have evolved, and when chemo is used now, it\u2019s sometimes for shorter periods or lower doses than it once was.</p><hl2>What are the side effects of chemotherapy?</hl2><p>Fatigue, nausea, tingling in the hands and feet, and sometimes hair loss are side effects of chemotherapy, said Dr. Monica Avila of Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. But there are medications for improving these side effects. And cold caps that cool the scalp can prevent hair loss, Avila said.</p><p>\u201cA patient can take anywhere from a few weeks to a month or two to recover from those effects,\u201d Avila said. Numbness and tingling can take longer to disappear, she said.</p><hl2>How long will Kate's treatment last?</hl2><p>The palace statement said that will be up to her doctors. \"The princess is now on a recovery pathway,\u201d the statement said.</p><p>___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
