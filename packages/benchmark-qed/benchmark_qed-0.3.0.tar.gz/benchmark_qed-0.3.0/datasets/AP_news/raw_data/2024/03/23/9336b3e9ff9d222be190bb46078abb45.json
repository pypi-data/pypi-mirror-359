    "description_summary": "Support has poured in from around the world for Kate, the Princess of Wales, after she revealed in a candid video message that she is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer following major abdominal surgery. Support on Saturday came after the princess spoke about the \u201chuge shock\u201d and \u201cincredibly tough couple of months\u201d for her family after her diagnosis. The poignant message follows weeks of frenzied speculation on social media about her health and well-being. The announcement will at least partly tamp down the intense and sometimes fantastical speculation and conspiracy theories about her condition that have multiplied on social media since Kensington Palace announced in mid-January that she had been hospitalized for unspecified abdominal surgery.",

She said she is now in the early stages of preventative chemotherapy, and is \u201cgetting stronger every day.\u201d</p><p>Her condition was initially thought to be noncancerous, until post-surgery tests revealed the diagnosis, she said.</p><p>The announcement will at least partly tamp down the intense and sometimes fantastical speculation and conspiracy theories about Kate's condition that have multiplied on social media since Kensington Palace announced in mid-January that she had been hospitalized for unspecified abdominal surgery.</p><p>Hashtags including \u201cWeLoveYouCatherine\u201d and \u201cGetWellSoonCatherine\u201d were trending Friday on X, formerly Twitter, while political leaders, celebrities and cancer survivors sent messages of support.</p><p>\u201cShe has been subjected to intense scrutiny and has been unfairly treated by certain sections of the media around the world and on social media,\u201d Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said. \u201cShe has shown tremendous bravery with her statement.\u201d</p><p>U.S. President Joe Biden posted on social media, saying he and first lady Jill Biden \u201cjoin millions around the world in praying for your full recovery, Princess Kate.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/king-charles-iii-cancer-britain-e0408a7c9bb86ad2af8754ce4b37d65e\">King Charles III</a>, who is also undergoing treatment for an unspecified type of cancer, said in a statement that he was \u201cso proud of Catherine for her courage in speaking as she did.\" Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, who have been estranged from the royal family since their move to California in 2020, said they wished \u201chealth and healing for Kate and the family.\"</p><p>Until Friday, there had been little information about Kate's condition, and her monthslong disappearance from public view fueled a flurry of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/princess-kate-photo-royals-media-2470c605dcc9766748bab82d8683e02b\">rumor-mongering</a> about the \u201cmissing\u201d future queen.</p><p>Officials had said only that Kate's surgery in January was successful and recuperation would keep the princess away from public duties until April.</p><p>Feelings of distrust about the royals gained ground earlier this month after Kate <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/princess-kate-manipulated-photo-482fda64281b4a63ccf30364d96b2622\">acknowledged that she altered</a> an official photo released to mark Mother\u2019s Day in the U.K.</p><p>The photo, which was meant to calm and reassure the public, triggered a backlash after The Associated Press and other news agencies retracted the image over concerns it was manipulated.</p><p>Even a video published last week by The Sun and TMZ that appeared to show Kate and William shopping near their home did not dispel the negative coverage, with some armchair detectives refusing to believe the video showed Kate at all.</p><p>In contrast, many of Saturday's newspaper front pages featured sympathetic headlines, with The Sun proclaiming: \u201cKate, you are not alone.\u201d The Daily Telegraph featured an opinion piece that read: \u201cSickening online trolls reveling in Princess's misery ought to be ashamed.\u201d The news also featured prominently in international newspapers from Italy to France.</p><p>\u201cI understand why she was keeping it a secret, but I am glad everyone knows now so they can not make assumptions,\" said Madeleine Pullitzer, an American student in Paris.</p><p>Well-wishers left flowers Saturday outside Windsor Castle, and many royal fans visiting Windsor and Kensington Palace said they were touched by Kate's personal message about her health struggles.</p><p>\u201cYour heart just goes out for her and her family, you know? I guess we all feel for her,\" said Natalie Richardson, who was visiting from New Zealand. It's \u201csuch a big thing to face for anyone.\u201d</p><p>Like Charles before her, Kate's decision to disclose her health condition was also praised for encouraging the public to think more about their own health and get worrying symptoms checked.</p><p>Kate directly addressed all those affected by cancer in her video, saying: \u201cPlease do not lose faith or hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis announcement is a stark and shocking reminder that cancer is no respecter of age or social status,\" said oncologist and cancer awareness campaigner Pat Price. \u201cA cancer diagnosis is always deeply concerning, but the fact that the princess is so young and very much in the prime of her life makes this news all the more upsetting and unsettling.\u201d</p><p>It was not immediately clear when Kate would return to public life.</p><p>Kate and William were not expected to join other royals for the traditional Easter Sunday service in Windsor.</p><p>\u201cThe Princess will return to official duties when she is cleared to do so by her medical team,\" a Kensington Palace spokesperson said. \u201cShe is in good spirits and is focused on making a full recovery.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press video journalists Oleg Cetinic in Paris and Mayuko Ono in Windsor, England, contributed to this report.</p>",
