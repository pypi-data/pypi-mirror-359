That's one of the two pills used in the most common type of abortion in the nation. The case centers on whether the Food and Drug Administration overlooked serious safety problems when it made the drug easier to obtain, including through mail-order pharmacies. Legal briefs in the case vary widely when it comes to descriptions of the pill\u2019s safety. Medical researchers and the FDA say the chance of severe problems from the pill is very small.",

The studies were cited in the pivotal <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-pill-lawsuit-mifepristone-misoprostol-kacsmaryk-74cb1c4cfab2c04f6cf2696151bc86ef\">Texas court ruling</a> that brought the matter before the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-pill-mifepristone-appeals-court-341bc44446e4b99071f0d8edb81ad4b8\">Supreme Court</a>. The publisher cited conflicts of interest by the authors and flaws in their research, although the studies' lead author called the retractions a baseless attack.</p><p>Here\u2019s what to know about the safety of mifepristone, which is typically used with <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mifepristone-supreme-court-abortion-d451e14148ffbe6ce4811b1a37651480\">misoprostol</a> in a medication abortion.</p><hl2>What safety limits has the FDA imposed since 2000?</hl2><p>The FDA approved mifepristone in 2000 as a safe and effective way to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-pills-mifepristone-supreme-court-27d18f91242eb08c4d805880ddb5bb60\">end early pregnancies</a>.</p><p>There are rare occasions when mifepristone can cause dangerous, excessive bleeding that requires emergency care. Because of that, the FDA imposed strict safety limits on who could prescribe and distribute it \u2014 only specially certified physicians and only as part of three mandatory in-person appointments with the patient getting the drug.</p><p>The doctors also had to be capable of performing emergency surgery to stop excess bleeding and an abortion procedure if the drug didn't end the pregnancy.</p><p>Over the years, the FDA reaffirmed mifepristone's safety and repeatedly eased restrictions, culminating in a 2021 decision doing away with any in-person requirements and allowing the pill to be sent through the mail.</p><hl2>How often are there serious problems?</hl2><p>Abortion opponents say the more lax restrictions resulted in many more \u201cemergency complications.\u201d But that argument lumps together women experiencing a range of issues with mifepristone \u2014 from the drug not working to people who may simply have questions or concerns but don\u2019t require medical care.</p><p>OB-GYNs say a tiny fraction of patients suffer \u201cmajor\u201d or \u201cserious\u201d adverse events after taking mifepristone.</p><p>A legal brief by a group of medical organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says: \u201cWhen used in medication abortion, major adverse events \u2014 significant infection, excessive blood loss, or hospitalization \u2014 occur in less than 0.32% of patients, according to a highly regarded study with more than 50,000 patients.\"</p><p>The definition that scientists generally use for serious adverse events includes blood transfusions, major surgery, hospital admissions and death, said Ushma Upadhyay, one of the authors of that <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25560122/\">2015 study</a>. She added: \u201cThe hospital admission is a catch-all for the very serious but more rare events such as major infection.\u201d</p><p>The prescribing information included in the packaging for mifepristone tablets lists slightly different statistics for what it calls \u201cserious adverse reactions.\u201d It cites ranges for how frequently various complications occur: 0.03% to 0.5% for transfusion; 0.2% for sepsis and 0.04% to 0.6% for hospitalization related to medication abortions. The ranges reflect findings across various relevant studies, experts said.</p><hl2>Why do patients go to the emergency room?</hl2><p>Mifepristone's labeling also lists a complication that most medical groups don\u2019t consider a serious or major adverse event: ER visits, which ranged from 2.9% to 4.6%. The current FDA label lists going to the ER as an option if patients experience prolonged heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain or a sustained fever.</p><p>But ER visits don\u2019t always reflect big problems, doctors told The Associated Press.</p><p>Some people may go there after a medication abortion because they want to be checked out or have questions but don\u2019t have a doctor, said Upadhyay, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. Others, she said, \u201cdon\u2019t want to go to their primary care provider about their abortion\u201d because of stigma.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29898742/\">study she co-authored</a> in 2018 found that slightly more than half of patients who visited the ER because of abortions received only observational care. Some, Upadhyay said, \"don\u2019t receive any treatment.\u201d</p><hl2>How effective is the pill?</hl2><p>Mifepristone results in a completed abortion 97.4% of the time, according to U.S. studies cited in the FDA label.</p><p>But in 2.6% of cases, a surgical intervention is needed. And 0.7% of the time, the pregnancy continues.</p><p>That's compared to a procedural abortion in a clinic, where the chance of the procedure failing to end a pregnancy \u201cis extremely, extremely low,\u201d probably less than 0.1%, said Dr. Pratima Gupta, a board member for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.</p><p>\u201cAny time a procedural abortion is done, the clinicians ensure that it was a complete abortion\u201d by examining the tissue that is removed or performing an ultrasound during or after the procedure, she said.</p><p>Gupta, who has done abortion procedures for more than 20 years, said there are \"very few complications from abortion \u2014 any kind of abortion, medication or procedural abortion.\u201d A <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-02834-w\">recent study</a> suggests that's just as true for medication abortions that happen in a clinic, a doctor's office or at home with the help of telehealth.</p><hl2>How does mifepristone's safety and effectiveness compare to other drugs?</hl2><p>The FDA makes drug approval decisions on a case-by-case basis, weighing effectiveness, safety and other factors.</p><p>No drug is 100% effective, and many common medications don't work for a significant portion of patients.</p><p>Antidepressants typically help between 40% and 60% of people with depression. New antibiotics approved by the FDA often resolve about 70% of infections.</p><p>Since 2000, roughly 6 million patients have taken mifepristone, according to the FDA. A 2021 review of agency records looking for deaths that were likely related to the drug identified 13, or .00027% of patients.</p><p>Medical organizations supporting mifepristone's availability say the drug's safety \u2014 given the rate of deaths \u2014 compares to \u201cibuprofen, which more than 30 million Americans take in any given day.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
