Instead, the company said, it will embrace a standard known as \u201cno antibiotics important to human medicine,\u201d which entails avoidance of such medicines commonly used to treat people and limits the use of animal antibiotics to cases of animal illness. Livestock producers have long used antibiotics to boost rapid weight gain in animals such as chickens, pigs, cows and sheep, although many nations, including the United States, have begun to restrict the practice.",

Over the past decade, however, many nations, including the United States, have begun to restrict the practice as evidence mounted that it was contributing to drug resistance and reducing the effectiveness of antibiotics against disease in humans.</p><p>Chick-Fil-A said it will begin shifting to the new policy in the spring of 2024. A company spokesman added that the move reflects company concerns about its ability to acquire sufficient supplies of antibiotic-free chicken. One of the poultry industry's largest companies, Tyson Foods, said last year that it was reintroducing some antibiotics to its chicken production and removing its \u201cNo Antibiotics Ever\u201d package labeling. It began to eliminate antibiotics from some of its poultry production in 2015.</p><p>In a May 2023 video featured on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcMHT35yPpX9VC4-F2IceFvUbhK_TvZFB\">Tyson Foods YouTube channel</a>, Tyson's senior director of animal welfare, Karen Christensen, described the shift as \u201cbased on scientific research and industry learnings.\u201d She noted that Tyson planned to begin using antibiotics known as ionophores, which don't play a role in human medicine, to \u201cimprove the overall health and welfare of the birds in our care.\u201d Ionophores have long been used to promote growth in livestock.</p>",
