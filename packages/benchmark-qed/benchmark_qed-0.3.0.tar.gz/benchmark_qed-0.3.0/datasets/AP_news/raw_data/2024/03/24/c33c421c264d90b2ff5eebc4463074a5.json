The 42-year-old princess said the cancer discovery was a \u201chuge shock\u201d and she was now in the early stages of preventative chemotherapy.</p><p>\u201cThe prince and princess are both enormously touched by the kind messages from people here in the U.K., across the Commonwealth and around the world in response to Her Royal Highness\u2019 message,\" a spokesperson for Kensington Palace said. \u201cThey are extremely moved by the public\u2019s warmth and support and are grateful for the understanding of their request for privacy at this time.\u201d</p><p>There has been a global outpouring of support, including from U.S. President Joe Biden, and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/king-charles-iii-cancer-britain-e0408a7c9bb86ad2af8754ce4b37d65e\">King Charles III</a> who is also undergoing treatment for cancer, which was found after he was undertaking treatment for an enlarged prostate. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kate-king-charles-cancer-royals-pressure-3ea5826f72d26f848146b6abae9b0518\">Neither Kate nor the king</a> have revealed what type of cancer they have or the stage at which it was being treated.</p><p>Charles' nephew, Peter Phillips, said the king is \u201cfrustrated\u201d that his recovery is taking longer than \u201che would want it to,\u201d but that he was in \u201cgood spirits\u201d and \u201cpushing\u201d his staff to be able to return to his duties after beginning his treatment for cancer last month.</p><p>\u201cI think ultimately he\u2019s hugely frustrated,\" Phillips, the son of Charles's sister Princess Anne, told Sky News Australia. \u201cHe\u2019s frustrated that he can\u2019t get on and do everything that he wants to be able to do. But he is very pragmatic, he understands that there\u2019s a period of time that he really needs to focus on himself.\u201d</p><p>People continued to flock Sunday to the royal's main London residence, Kensington Palace, as well as <a href=\"https://apnews.com/video/wales-royalty-united-kingdom-cancer-texas-9dc8213dd9c54f0cb920b83949d0291c\">to Windsor Castle,</a> where they spend most of their time, to show support for the princess, with many leaving flowers.</p><p>Until Friday, officials had only said Kate\u2019s surgery in January was successful and recuperation would keep the princess away from public duties until April. This has sparked a flurry of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/princess-kate-photo-royals-media-2470c605dcc9766748bab82d8683e02b\">rumor-mongering</a> about the \u201cmissing\u201d future queen, compounded after Kate <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/princess-kate-manipulated-photo-482fda64281b4a63ccf30364d96b2622\">acknowledged that she altered</a> an official photo released to mark Mother\u2019s Day in the U.K. earlier this month.</p><p>The photo, meant to reassure the public, triggered a backlash after The Associated Press and other news agencies retracted it over manipulation concerns.</p><p>Even a video published last week by The Sun and TMZ that appeared to show Kate and William shopping near their home didn't dispel the negative coverage.</p><p>Criticism of those jumping to sometime-outlandish conclusions continued to be voiced over the weekend.</p><p>Paddy Harverson, previously the official spokesman of Kate and the Prince of Wales, said that the speculation and pressure around Kate's health and whereabouts before her video statement was \u201cthe worst I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>However, he said he thought Kate would have revealed her cancer diagnosis exactly as she had, regardless of what was being speculated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m absolutely convinced that if we hadn\u2019t had all the madness and social media, if we hadn\u2019t had the sort of the Mother\u2019s Day photo mistake, they would have still done it like this,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThey would have still waited till this last Friday when the schools are breaking up to make the announcement.\u201d</p>",
