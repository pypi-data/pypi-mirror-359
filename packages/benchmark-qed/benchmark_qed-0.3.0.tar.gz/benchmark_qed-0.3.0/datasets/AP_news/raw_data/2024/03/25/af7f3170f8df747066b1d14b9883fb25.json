    "description_summary": "Senior doctors at major hospitals in South Korea have begun submitting their resignations in support of medical interns and residents who have been on a strike over the government\u2019s push to sharply increase medical school admissions. The move on Monday comes after President Yoon Suk Yeol called for talks with doctors while suggesting a possible softening of punitive steps against the striking junior doctors. It\u2019s unclear whether and how soon the government and doctors would sit down for talks and reach a breakthrough. About 12,000 interns and medical residents have faced impending suspensions of their licenses over their strikes, which are now in their fifth week.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Senior doctors at major hospitals in South Korea began submitting their resignations en masse on Monday in support of medical interns and residents who have been on strike for five weeks over the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-doctors-walkouts-patients-explained-326632dd061fc3b004b663cc761f9016\">government\u2019s push</a> to sharply increase medical school admissions.</p><p>The senior doctors\u2019 action isn't likely to cause an immediate worsening of hospital operations in South Korea because they have said they would continue to work even after submitting their resignations. But prospects for an early end to the medical impasse were dim, as the doctors\u2019 resignation submissions came after <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-doctors-walkouts-president-yoon-7a2b35213324a485612caafa5f440793\">President Yoon Suk Yeol</a> called for talks with doctors while suggesting a possible softening of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-doctors-strike-suspensions-efbdddae9c6a4ddee19f4ba294202db3#:~:text=SEOUL%2C%20South%20Korea%20(AP),medical%20services%2C%20officials%20said%20Thursday.\">punitive steps</a> against the striking junior doctors.</p><p>About 12,000 <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-trainee-doctors-walk-off-d991fc8a07c535ea737b4f31b01c5658\">interns and medical residents</a> have faced impending suspensions of their licenses over their <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-junior-doctors-strike-deadline-fff231bd792d275395cfc6c7f7188226\">refusal</a> to end their strikes, which have caused hundreds of canceled surgeries and other treatments at their hospitals.</p><p>They oppose the government\u2019s plan to increase the country\u2019s medical school admission cap by two-thirds, saying schools can\u2019t handle such a steep increase in students and that it would eventually hurt South Korea\u2019s medical services. But officials say more doctors are urgently needed because South Korea has a rapidly aging population and its doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest in the developed world.</p><p>In a meeting with governing party leader Han Dong-hoon on Sunday, representatives of medical professors and doctors at some 40 university hospitals \u2014 where the junior doctors worked while training \u2014 expressed support for the striking doctors, saying the government\u2019s recruitment plan \u201cwould collapse our country\u2019s medical system,\u201d Kim Chang-soo, head of the emergency committee at those universities, said Monday.</p><p>Kim called Yoon\u2019s overture a positive step but said the current standoff between doctors and the government won\u2019t be resolved unless the government rolls back its recruitment plan.</p><p>He said doctors at the universities were expected to stick to earlier plans to submit resignations voluntarily and cut back their working hours to 52 hours per week \u2014 the maximum weekly number of legal working hours. Observers say senior doctors have been grappling with excessive workloads after their juniors left their hospitals.</p><p>\u201cIf the government has an intention of withdrawing its plan or has an intention of considering it, we\u2019re ready to discuss all pending issues with the government before the public,\u201d Kim said.</p><p>Later Monday, an unspecified number of senior doctors went ahead and handed in their resignations, according to doctors involved in the protests. They said some doctors had already submitted resignations last week.</p><p>After Sunday\u2019s meeting, Han asked Yoon\u2019s office to \u201cflexibly handle\u201d the issue of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-doctors-strikes-license-suspensions-d4b2485bb3d9034d0866f4dfbdaa9963\">planned license suspensions</a> for the striking doctors. Yoon then asked his prime minister to pursue \u201ca flexible measure\u201d to resolve the dispute and seek constructive consultations with doctors, according to Yoon\u2019s office.</p><p>It\u2019s unclear whether and how soon the government and doctors would sit down for talks and reach a breakthrough. Some observers say the government\u2019s likely softening of punishments for the striking doctors and its pursuit of dialogue with doctors were likely related to next month\u2019s parliamentary elections as further disruptions of hospital operations would be unhelpful for ruling party candidates.</p><p>The striking junior doctors represent less than 10% of South Korea\u2019s 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals, they account for about 30% to 40% of the doctors, assisting senior doctors during surgeries and dealing with inpatients while training.</p><p>Public surveys show that a majority of South Koreans support the government\u2019s push to create more doctors, and critics say that doctors, one of the highest-paid professions in South Korea, worry about lower incomes due to a rise in the number of doctors.</p><p>Officials say more doctors are required to address a long-standing shortage of physicians in rural areas and in essential but low-paying specialties. But doctors say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also likely result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.</p>",
