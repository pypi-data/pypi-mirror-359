The Senate passed the bill on a 27-13 vote Tuesday. The House approved it earlier this month. It goes next to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. She is a strong abortion rights supporter and is expected to veto the bill. However, supporters appear to have exactly the two-thirds majorities they would need to override a veto. Lawmakers are pursuing the measure even though Kansas affirmed abortion rights in a statewide vote.",

She is a strong abortion rights supporter and is expected to veto the bill, but supporters appear to have exactly the two-thirds majorities in both chambers they would need to override a veto.</p><p>At least eight states require similar reporting, but none of them has had a statewide vote on abortion rights as Kansas did in August 2022. In the first state ballot question on abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0\">Dobbs decision</a>, voters <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-primary-elections-kansas-abortion-b6d62a852c2ce4617f2c03589fbb523e\">decisively protected abortion rights</a> under the state constitution.</p><p>Democrats are frustrated because Republicans and anti-abortion groups have pursued <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-medication-reversal-kansas-01304fcbe7b014ec46f818633faf28a7\">new rules for abortion providers</a> despite the 2022 vote. But supporters of the reporting bill say it would give the state better data that would help legislators make policy decisions.</p><p>The bill would require providers to ask patients 11 questions about their reasons for terminating a pregnancy, including that they can\u2019t afford another child, raising a child would hinder their education or careers, or a spouse or partner wanted her to have an abortion. A woman would not be required to answer, however.</p><p>The bill also would require providers to report each patient's age, marital status, race and education level, while using a \u201cconfidential code\u201d for each patient so that they wouldn\u2019t be identified to the state. The state would be barred for at least five years from identifying the abortion providers in the data it publishes.</p>",

However, the primary focus is on the legislative and political aspects rather than the direct health implications or outcomes.
