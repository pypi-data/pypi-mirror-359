    "description_summary": "Two former officials of a Massachusetts veterans home where at least 76 people died during the COVID-19 pandemic will avoid jail time in the case. Bennett Walsh, the former superintendent of the Veterans\u2019 Home in Holyoke, and Dr. David Clinton, its former medical director, settled their criminal cases Tuesday. They were facing five counts of criminal neglect after the Massachusetts\u2019 highest court overruled a lower court judge last year and reinstated the charges. Walsh and Clinton pleaded not guilty in 2020 to charges stemming from their decision that year to combine two dementia units. That step brought together residents who tested positive for the coronavirus with those who manifested no symptoms.",

They cited the bad conditions and lack of staffing at the facility and the need for a sentence that \"merits real consequences.\"</p><p>But defense attorneys argued the court had to take into account the fact that this was in the early days of the pandemic when the dangers of the disease were poorly understood and the facility, like many nursing homes at the time, was hamstrung by a lack of staffing and limited testing. They also argued that Walsh raised the alarm about conditions at the home but that those warnings didn't go up the chain of command.</p><p>They sought and Hampden Superior Court Judge Edward J. McDonough accepted their request that each charge be continued without a finding for a three-month probationary period \u2014 a plea in which they acknowledge facts in the case could result in a guilty verdict on each count.</p><p>That ruling prompted anger from the state.</p><p>\u201cToday the justice system failed the families who lost their loved ones at the Holyoke Soldiers\u2019 Home,\" state Attorney General Andrea Campbell said in a statement. \"I am disappointed and disheartened with the Court\u2019s decision, and want these families and our veterans to know my office did everything it could to seek accountability. We will continue to be vigilant in prosecuting cases of elder abuse and neglect.\u201d</p><p>Susan Kenney, whose father Charles Lowell died of Covid-19 at the home, was in court and expressed shock at the ruling.</p><p>\u201cIt's disgusting, absolutely disgusting,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's just a injustice. There is no accountability. They need to be made examples of. Everyone knew that the virus was coming down the pike. You don\u2019t contaminate people. There are basic things you don\u2019t do and they were done there because their leadership sucked.\u201d</p><p>Walsh and Clinton pleaded not guilty in 2020 to charges stemming from their decision in March of that year to combine two dementia units, bringing together residents who were positive for the coronavirus with those who had no symptoms.</p><p>A 2022 state Inspector General\u2019s report found that Walsh lacked both the leadership skills and the temperament to run such a facility when he was hired in 2016. The <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/doc/holyoke-soldiers-home-may-2016-to-february-2020/download\">91-page report,</a> which covers the period from May 2016 until February 2020 \u2014 just before the pandemic struck with full force \u2014 was also highly critical of the process that led to Walsh's hiring as superintendent.</p><p>Walsh, a former Marine who resigned after criminal charges were filed, had no supervisory experience in a health care setting or skilled nursing facility when he was hired. Yet according to state law, such experience was not required of the home\u2019s superintendent at the time.</p><p>In 2021, McDonough dismissed the charges. McDonough found that there was \u201cinsufficient reasonably trustworthy evidence that, had these two dementia units not been merged, the medical condition\u201d of five veterans in question would have been materially different.</p><p>But last year, Massachusetts\u2019 highest court reinstated charges. In their ruling, the majority of the justices found that the facts presented to the grand jury constituted probable cause to believe that Walsh and Clinton violated the elder abuse statute and that Hampden Superior Court Judge Edward McDonough Jr. erred in dismissing the charges.</p><p>In 2022, Massachusetts agreed to pay $56 million to settle <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/covid-health-lawsuits-massachusetts-1c0ad830ccdfa1c9adbce5d9bfd6f806\">a class-action lawsuit</a> brought by the families of veterans who died.</p>",
