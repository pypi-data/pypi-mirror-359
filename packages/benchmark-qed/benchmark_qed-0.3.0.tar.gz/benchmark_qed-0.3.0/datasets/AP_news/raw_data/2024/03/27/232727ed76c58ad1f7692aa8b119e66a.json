The pope\u2019s appearance on Wednesday was the first since Palm Sunday mass in St. Peter\u2019s Square, when he decided at the last minute to skip his homily, avoiding the speech at the start of a busy Holy Week that will test his increasingly fragile health. In recent weeks, the 87-year-old Pontiff has often shown difficulties in walking and has been heard breathing heavily during public events. The Holy Week schedule is challenging for popes even under the best of circumstances.",
