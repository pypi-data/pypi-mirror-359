Unofficial returns show Marilyn Lands defeated Republican Teddy Powell to win the open legislative seat. Lands\u2019 victory was celebrated by Democrats who have attempted to portray the state GOP as too extreme. Alabama has a near-total abortion ban. The state was recently in the national spotlight after a court ruling equating frozen embryos to children. Powell issued a statement conceding the race and congratulating Lands on her victory.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>Marilyn Lands, who campaigned on abortion rights in deeply conservative Alabama, won a special election to the Alabama Legislature, in a victory that Democrats say illustrates voter backlash to extreme reproductive restrictions imposed by Republicans.</p><p>Lands, a Democrat, on Tuesday decisively defeated Republican Teddy Powell to win the open House of Representatives seat in a suburban district that \u2014 while increasingly politically moderate \u2014 had long been held by the GOP. Her victory was celebrated by Democrats who said it underscores the importance of reproductive rights as an issue across the country ahead of the 2024 elections.</p><p>\u201cVoters want something different, and I think they are tired of women\u2019s freedoms and reproductive health care not being addressed,\u201d Lands told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.</p><p>Alabama bans abortion at all stages of pregnancy with no exception for pregnancies arising from rape. Lands' victory comes several weeks after in vitro fertilization services were temporarily paused in the state after the Alabama Supreme Court issued a ruling <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alabama-ivf-frozen-embryos-ruling-cab8171e80c88a088778dc7a187b7b5a\">equating frozen embryos to children</a>.</p><p>Lands, a licensed mental health counselor, had also campaigned on education and economic development issues, but took square aim at the state\u2019s abortion ban, at times invoking the deeply personal to do so. She shared her story of obtaining an abortion two decades ago after genetic testing determined the baby had trisomy 13, a genetic disorder, and could not survive.</p><p>Lands said she made the decision to tell her own story after speaking with a woman who had to leave Alabama to obtain an abortion after receiving a similar fetal diagnosis.</p><p>\u201cI saw the parallels in our story. And I shared my story of course with her. The story really contrasts that two decades later, we\u2019ve gone backwards, and women have fewer freedoms,\u201d Lands said.</p><p>As she knocked on doors across the district, Lands said was struck by how many women volunteered their own stories. Some were like her own. Others involved miscarriages or struggles with fertility.</p><p>\u201cI feel like that so many of these women\u2019s health issues and family health issues can be very isolating for people. And I hope that maybe part of what\u2019s happening here is we are opening up a dialogue to where people realize how common these kinds of things are,\u201d Lands said.</p><p>The win was a victory for Democrats in the Deep South state where Republicans hold all statewide offices and a lopsided majority in the Legislature.</p><p>President Joe Biden\u2019s 2024 campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, said the results in Alabama \u201cshould serve as a major warning sign for Trump\u201d that \u201cvoters will not stand for his attacks on reproductive health care.\u201d</p><p>Alabama Republican Party Chairperson John Wahl disputed that the race outcome is a bellwether with implications beyond that district. He said it was a low-turnout election in a \u201cpurple district where Democrats always had a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretending that this election reflects on the entire state of Alabama is disingenuous and shows either a lack of understanding of the political landscape or an attempt to mislead voters,\u201d Wahl said.</p><p>Lands\u2019 victory came in a suburban district that is considered more politically moderate than other GOP-held ones. The Madison County district includes parts of Madison and Huntsville, which is home to the Army\u2019s Redstone Arsenal and NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center. While former President Donald Trump captured 62% of the vote across Alabama in 2020, he won just under 53% of the vote in Madison County.</p><p>There were just under 6,000 votes cast in Tuesday\u2019s special election compared with more than 14,000 cast in 2022, when Lands lost to Republican David Cole. The legislative seat became open again after Cole stepped down and pleaded guilty to a voting fraud charge that he rented a closet-size space to fraudulently run for office in a <a href=\"https://www.waff.com/2023/05/26/deposition-held-rep-david-cole-contest-residency-district-10/\">district where he did not live</a>.</p><p>Former U.S. Sen. Doug Jones, the last Democrat to hold statewide office in Alabama, said Lands\u2019 victory was partly fueled by frustration with extremist policies put in place by the state GOP.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going too far. You talk about an activist government. This is a government in Alabama that wants to encroach on every aspect of people\u2019s lives,\u201d Jones said.</p><p>He said Lands\u2019 victory could be a positive sign for Democrats in future Alabama races, but he cautioned against overreaching on what it represents. Jones defeated Republican Roy Moore in a 2017 special election but lost in 2020 to current U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville.</p><p>\u201cI mean, people saw my election in 2017 as like, \u2018Oh my God, we flipped Alabama blue.\u2019 Well, that\u2019s not the case. And in fact, I\u2019m not one to advocate flipping the entire state one way or the other,\u201d Jones said. He added that one-party rule, regardless of the party, has not been good for the state.</p><p>\u201cWe need competition, and that\u2019s what Marilyn provided,\u201d Jones said.</p>",
