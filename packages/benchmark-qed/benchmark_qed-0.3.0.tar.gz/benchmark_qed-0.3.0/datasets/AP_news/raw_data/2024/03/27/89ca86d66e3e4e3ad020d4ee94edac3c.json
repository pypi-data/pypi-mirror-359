Maura Healey has said state monitors are keeping eye on the nine health care facilities operated by Steward Health Care in Massachusetts, including hospitals in some of the state\u2019s poorer communities.</p><p>The Dallas-based company operates more than 30 hospitals nationwide.</p><p>Before the sale can be completed, the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission must review the proposal.</p><p>The commission doesn\u2019t have the authority to block a transaction but can refer findings to the state Attorney General's office, the Department of Public Health, or other Massachusetts agencies for possible further action.</p><p>The documents filed with the state did not include a cost for the transaction. Under the deal, Optum would aquire a Steward affiliate that includes the company\u2019s primary care doctors and other clinicians in nine states.</p><p>Health Policy Commission Executive Director David Seltz said the panel is committed to a \u201crigorous, data-driven oversight of health care market changes to bring important information to the public.\u201d</p><p>He said details of the proposal will be studied to examine potential effects on health care costs, quality, access and equity. The sale can\u2019t be completed until after the commission\u2019s review and any additional reviews by state or federal antitrust authorities.</p><p>\u201cThis is a significant proposed change involving two large medical providers, both in Massachusetts and nationally, with important implications for the delivery and cost of health care across Massachusetts,\u201d Seltz said in a statement.</p><p>Emails to Steward Health Care and Optum seeking comment were not immediately returned.</p><p>The commission's review of the transaction shouldn't delay state and federal antitrust authorities from doing their own review to protect patient access and affordability, Democratic Massachusetts House Speaker Ronald Mariano said.</p><p>Once all required information has been provided about the sale, the commission will have 30 days to assess any potential impacts of the transaction.</p><p>If the sale is anticipated to have a significant impact on health care costs and market functioning, the commission can begin a fuller cost and market impact review.</p><p>Democratic U.S. Sen. Edward Markey said for-profit companies that participate in the health care system must understand that their decisions have direct impacts on patients and communities.</p><p>\u201cWith this announcement, Optum must demonstrate that it can meet the even greater responsibility to preserve and protect health care access,\u201d Markey said at a Wednesday press conference in Boston. \u201cI hope they will live up to that responsibility by controlling costs and putting patients and providers first.\u201d</p><p>Markey, chair of the senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security, said he plans to hold a congressional hearing in Boston next week on the impact of for-profit companies on health care access.</p><p>U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a fellow Massachusetts Democrat, said her top priority is making sure Steward\u2019s hospitals in Massachusetts stay open.</p><p>\u201cAfter years of gross profiteering and mismanagement, Steward\u2019s latest plan raises more serious questions about the future of the Massachusetts health care system,\" Warren said in a written statement.</p><p>\u201cSteward executives have no credibility,\u201d she added. \u201cIt would be a terrible mistake for Steward to be allowed to walk away while looting Massachusetts one more time.\u201d</p>",
