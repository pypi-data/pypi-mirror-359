In addition to the products from Kobayashi, a government health ministry official says more than 40 products containing benikoji have been recalled.

The recalled products could be bought without a prescription from a doctor, and could be purchased at drug stores.</p><p>Kobayashi apologized and asked in an online statement: \u201cPlease stop taking our products, and please do not use them in the future.\u201d</p><p>Repeated calls to Kobayashi went unanswered. The company president and other top officials held a news conference last week when the problem first surfaced, bowing their heads in apology, as is the standard in Japan.</p><p>The ministry official warned there could be more victims in the days ahead. He asked everyone to stop ingesting anything with benikoji in it. Those with health problems, like weak kidneys, could be especially vulnerable, he said.</p><p>All the products were made in Japan, although it is unclear if any of the raw materials were imported. A recall of imported health supplements has happened before, but this is the first major recall of a domestically produced supplement, according to Japanese media reports.</p><p>___</p><p>Yuri Kageyama is on X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\">https://twitter.com/yurikageyama</a></p>",
