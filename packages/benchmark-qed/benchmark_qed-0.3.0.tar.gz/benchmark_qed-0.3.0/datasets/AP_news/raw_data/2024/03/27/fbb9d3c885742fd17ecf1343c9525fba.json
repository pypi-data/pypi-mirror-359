    "description_summary": "Religious and neo-conservative groups have been ramping up pressure to ban abortions in staunchly Catholic Croatia. They have held vigils outside abortion clinics and marches drawing thousands of people. More recently, groups of men were kneeling and praying at public squares in Croatian cities. The fierce debate has fueled divisions in the European Union nation of some 3.9 million people. Abortion remains legal but access to the procedure is often denied, sending many women to neighboring Slovenia to end a pregnancy. This is in stark contrast with Croatia\u2019s recent past when it was part of the former Yugoslavia, a Communist-run country that protected abortion rights in its constitution 50 years ago.",

However, the post-Communist revival of nationalist, religious and conservative sentiments have threatened that legacy.</p><p>Yugoslavia's abortion laws stayed intact after Croatia split from the country in 1991, but doctors were granted the right to refuse to perform them in 2003. As a result, many women have traveled to neighboring Slovenia for an abortion over the years.</p><p>\u201cThe gap between laws and practice is huge,\u201d feminist activist Sanja Sarnavka said. \u201cDue to the immense influence by conservative groups and the Catholic church it (abortion) is de facto impossible in many places, or severely restricted.\u201d</p><p>A current campaign by a Za Zivot \u2014 \u201cfor life\u201d \u2014 movement in Croatia includes prayers, vigils and lectures \u201cfor the salvation of the unborn and a stop to abortions in our nation.\u201d</p><p>A men\u2019s organization dubbed Muzevni Budite, or \u201cbe masculine,\u201d is behind the prayers in city squares, where they preach the revival of male dominance and traditional gender roles along with a campaign against abortions.</p><p>In 2022, the weekslong ordeal of a <a href=\"Cavajda said the ordeal has been very hard for her and her family. \u201cWhy prolong the waiting, why should I keep waking up or going to bed wondering if he had died, whether I\u2019ll get blood poisoning or not?\u201d she said. \u201cThe worst is yet to come for me.\u201d\">woman who had been denied an abortion</a> even though her child had serious health problems caused an uproar and triggered protests in Croatia's liberal community.</p><p>Mirela Cavajda was 20 weeks pregnant when doctors informed her that her fetus had a brain tumor and no chance of a normal life. Though the abortion was eventually permitted in Croatia, Cavajde had it performed in Slovenia.</p><p>As many as 207 Croatian women traveled to a single border hospital in Slovenia that same year for the procedure, a study by Croatian obstetrician Jasenka Gruji\u0107 showed.</p><p>The percentage of doctors who refuse to perform abortions as conscientious objectors reaches 100% in some Croatian hospitals, the study found. The objectors include not only obstetricians but also anaesthesiologists and other doctors needed for the procedure, Grujic said.</p><p>\u201cCroatia\u2019s medical community is deeply divided,\u201d Grujic wrote in the analysis she made available to The Associated Press. \u201cI hope this trend of actual unavailability of abortion will be reversed. That is so dangerous for women\u2019s health and lives.\u201d</p><p>Yugoslav physicians first considered legalizing abortion back in 1935, and that became a reality in the 1950s. Pushed forward by a women\u2019s organization born out of World War II, the right to abortion was later included in Yugoslavia\u2019s constitution.</p><p>Stating that \u201cit is the right of a human being to freely decide on the birth of children,\u201d Yugoslavia\u2019s constitution did not explicitly guarantee abortion, as France's does. But it nonetheless gave Yugoslav women easy access to terminate pregnancies in clinics throughout the former six-member federation.</p><p>\u201cFrance\u2019s decision reminded us that we had that right in the 1974 constitution, which means exactly 50 years before France,\u201d Ignjatovic said.</p><p>Elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia, Serbia and Slovenia have included the freedom to choose whether to have children in their constitutions. Bosnia\u2019s women can legally obtain abortion during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, though economic impediments exist in the impoverished, post-war country.</p><p>___</p><p>Gec reported from Belgrade, Serbia.
