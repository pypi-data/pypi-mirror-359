He is resting comfortably under the care of extremely skilled hospice nurses,\u201d the statement said.</p><p>Henry announced his diagnosis of late-stage stomach cancer on Feb. 26 during a news conference. He began chemotherapy at the beginning of March.</p><p>\u201cMy initial scans have shown that the cancer is currently spreading through my lymph nodes and other organs,\u201d Henry said at the time. \u201cTherefore, my prognosis is not exactly encouraging.\u201d</p><p>Henry was elected in November to his fifth term as mayor of Indiana\u2019s second most populous city with about 270,000 residents.
