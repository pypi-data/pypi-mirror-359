    "description_summary": "President Joe Biden is announcing new steps to protect consumers who buy short-term health insurance plans that critics say amount to junk. A new rule finalized by the Democratic president's administration will limit short-term health insurance to just three months. And the plans can only be renewed for a maximum of four months, instead of up to the three years allowed under Biden's predecessor, Republican President Donald Trump. The Biden administration is also requiring short-term plans to provide consumers with clear explanations of the services they cover and how much. The White House says the rule is part of the president's interest in reducing costs for consumers.",

Consumers would later be surprised to learn when they tried to use the insurance that their benefits were capped or certain coverages were not provided.</p><p>Tanden said Trump and other Republican-elected officials undermined the Affordable Care Act by allowing insurance companies to exploit loopholes and sell short-term plans that often leave consumers surprised when confronted by thousands of dollars in medical bills.</p><p>The ACA was signed into law in 2010 by President Barack Obama. Biden and his administration have spent this week marking the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-harris-health-care-north-carolina-282cabddd8b5bcfaccce86b9c499a2da\">14th anniversary of the landmark law's enactment</a>.</p><p>Short-term plans were expanded in 2018 during the Trump administration as a cheaper alternative to the Affordable Care Act's costlier comprehensive insurance. Trump, who had promised to repeal and replace the law, has praised short-term plans as \u201cmuch less expensive health care at a much lower price.\u201d</p><p>In 2020, a divided federal appeals court upheld the Trump administration\u2019s expansion of short-term health insurance plans.</p><p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the Trump administration had the legal authority to increase the duration of the health plans from three to 12 months, with the option of renewing them for 36 months. The plans do not have to cover people with preexisting conditions or provide basic benefits like prescription drugs.</p>",
