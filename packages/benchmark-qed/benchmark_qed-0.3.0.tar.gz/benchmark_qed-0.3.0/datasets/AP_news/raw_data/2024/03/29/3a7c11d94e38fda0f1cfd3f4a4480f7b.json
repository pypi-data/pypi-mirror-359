Lizelle Gonzalez is seeking $1,000,000 in damages after she was arrested and jailed for three days after she induced an abortion that led to an emergency room visit in January 2022. Gonzalez' attorney claimed the district attorney\u2019s office misrepresented facts to secure an indictment for murder charges and that the hospital violated her client's privacy rights by sharing information during the investigation.",

She is seeking $1 million in damages.</p><p>\u201cThe fallout from Defendants\u2019 illegal and unconstitutional actions has forever changed the Plaintiff\u2019s life,\u201d the lawsuit stated.</p><p>Starr County District Attorney Gocha Ramirez said Friday that he had not yet been served the lawsuit and declined comment. Starr County Judge Eloy Vera, the county's top elected official, also declined comment.</p><p>According to the lawsuit, Gonzalez was 19 weeks pregnant when she used misoprostol, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mifepristone-supreme-court-abortion-d451e14148ffbe6ce4811b1a37651480\">one of two drugs used</a> in medication abortions. Misoprostol is also used to treat stomach ulcers.</p><p>After taking the pills, Gonzalez received an obstetrical examination at the hospital emergency room and was discharged with abdominal pain. She returned with bleeding the next day and an exam found no fetal heartbeat. Doctors performed a caesarian section to deliver a stillborn baby.</p><p>The lawsuit argues that the hospital violated the patient\u2019s privacy rights when they reported the abortion to the district attorney\u2019s office, which then carried out its own investigation and produced a murder charge against Gonzalez.</p><p>Cecilia Garza, an attorney for Gonzalez, said prosecutors pursued an indictment despite knowing that a woman receiving the abortion is exempted from a murder charge by state law.</p><p>Ramirez announced the charges would be dropped just days after the woman\u2019s arrest but not before she\u2019d spent two nights in jail and was identified by name as a murder suspect.</p><p>In February, Ramirez agreed to pay a $1,250 fine and have his license held in a probated suspension for 12 months in a settlement reached with the State Bar of Texas. He told The Associated Press at the time that he \u201cmade a mistake\u201d and agreed to the punishment because it allows his office to keep running and him to keep prosecuting cases.</p>",
