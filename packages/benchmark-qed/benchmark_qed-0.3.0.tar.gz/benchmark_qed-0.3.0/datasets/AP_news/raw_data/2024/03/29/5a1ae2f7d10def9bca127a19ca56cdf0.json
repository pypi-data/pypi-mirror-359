The American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood say it's now unconstitutional to require mandatory waiting periods and multiple in-person informational appointments to receive an abortion. Ohio is one of four states that have amended their constitutions to enshrine abortion rights since Roe v. Wade was overturned. The lawsuit filed on behalf of abortion clinics asks a Franklin County court to declare the restrictions to be unconstitutional and permanently unenforceable. Republican Attorney General Dave Yost\u2019s office hasn\u2019t commented on the lawsuit.",
