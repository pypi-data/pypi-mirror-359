But minority Democrats couldn\u2019t leverage those differences to advance top policy priorities. Republicans are hoping tax cuts and a harder line on immigration will carry them to victory in November\u2019s legislative races. Democrats walked away more furious than ever about the failure to expand Medicaid health insurance.Some issues unified Republicans, including speeding up an income tax cut and uniting around a crackdown on undocumented immigrants in jails. But there\u2019s a continuing power struggle between the chambers. Sharp disagreements were evident as each chamber completely disregarded measures passed by the other.",

Democrats walked away more furious than ever about the failure to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/medicaid-expansion-georgia-legislature-4e48ea791d970d6e788bebc0def8cea7\">expand Medicaid health insurance</a>, one cornerstone of their campaign to make gains in the state House.</p><p>In the background of 2024 campaigns for all 236 state legislative seats is jockeying for elections to statewide office in 2026. Republican Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, displaying a conservative edge, seems more likely than ever to run to succeed <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/brian-p-kemp\">Gov. Brian Kemp</a>, as many GOP lawmakers try to satisfy an activist base.</p><p>Some issues unified Republicans, including speeding up an <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/georgia-brian-kemp-corporate-income-tax-cuts-7a414376871e7baf20bfb2ea12bb7260\">income tax cut</a>, uniting around a crackdown on <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/immigration-law-georgia-laken-riley-c1a56c0001aa385e59d2fa24cf3abb4c\">undocumented immigrants in jails</a>, and pay raises for <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/georgia-budget-pay-raises-e5ccd594df8354ae12454b099427569b\">teachers and state employees</a>.</p><p>But there's a continuing power struggle between the chambers. Last year, that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/georgia-budget-hospitals-universities-burt-jones-01cec65a2d41a0b77fa4176c2dc145b2\">conflict burst into the open</a>, with House and Senate leaders killing bills from the other chamber in a dispute that was set off by Jones' push to loosen health care permitting requirements.</p><p>Jones won a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/georgia-health-care-hospitals-certificate-need-con-aa09dd79d34f912e0103b0e0b444693f\">partial loosening</a> of those rules this year, and conflict overall was less public. But sharp disagreements were evident as each chamber completely disregarded measures passed by the other.</p><p>\u201cYou know, some folks choose politics. The House chooses results,\" Republican House Speaker Jon Burns of Newington told reporters moments after the House adjourned at 12:58 a.m. Friday. He and other House leaders said they instead focused on \u201ckitchen table\u201d issues often funded through the budget, like a spending boost <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/georgia-preschool-prekindergarten-early-childhood-education-d0a78cf1cae6b2dc1ebe799f58c60fa1\">for prekindergarten programs</a>.</p><p>Divisions showed in how, even more than normal, decisions cascaded into the last hours of the last legislative day. Both the House and Senate blew past a once-sacrosanct midnight deadline.</p><p>\u201cThere were a lot of challenges and tensions between the two chambers. It\u2019s not the first time, but it was particularly elevated this year.\u201d said Rep. Scott Holcomb. The Atlanta Democrat again saw the Senate snub his push to compensate people released from prison after they are exonerated, even though top House Republicans supported the effort.</p><p>That was far from the only initiative that failed. The Senate spent precious time on the session's last day passing a ban on <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/georgia-transgender-care-minors-restrictions-ban-2ac2dc48bc9f98c6f31782ef70d31357\">puberty blocking drugs</a> for transgender youth, but the bill sank without a trace in the House. So did <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/georgia-schools-sex-education-transgender-sports-library-49827b9441d21b4688056cadc6ebc93d\">an education bill</a> that sought to cut back on sex education and write a ban on transgender girls playing girls' sports into law, as well as a Senate bill <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/american-library-association-georgia-senate-bf1c592f8862a8cff40a3ee4a9b7d34e\">banning public money</a> from being spent on what Republican senators say is the left-wing American Library Association.</p><p>\u201cTo me, the 2024 session was a battle of the far-right Senate versus the moderate Republican House, in which the House ultimately prevailed by stopping the vast majority of these culture war issues, from attacks against transgender youth to putting a Clarence Thomas monument on the Capitol grounds,\u201d House Minority Whip Sam Park, a Lawrenceville Democrat, said Friday.</p><p>But on some other terms, the Senate may the winner. All of the priorities the Senate Republican Caucus <a href=\"https://senatepress.net/georgia-senate-republicans-announce-2024-caucus-priorities.html\">announced in January</a> became law. That included a bill <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/georgia-cash-bail-bond-jails-misdemeanors-4760d32bddb3535c5ffb216000b10cf1\">requiring cash bail</a> for more crimes, and a call for private and home school vouchers that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/georgia-education-school-choice-vouchers-d2afa90868745cbc2a90c693fc44f4da\">finally passed the House</a> after Kemp and House leaders joined the push. A Senate-backed bill <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/georgia-social-media-children-age-porn-pornography-007fae0a3b3f80393b4a7d7a7a8b430a\">requiring parental consent</a> before children younger than 16 can sign up for social media is also on the way to Kemp's desk.</p><p>\u201cI'm proud of all that the Senate accomplished this session, promoting an agenda to help Georgia families, expand access to health care, support HBCUs, crack down on sanctuary policies and protect women's sports,\u201d Jones said in a statement Friday. \u201cThese issues are a marathon, not a sprint, and we'll continue to build on our accomplishments year after year to enact policies that lift up the middle class and fight back against radical Democrats' insanity.\u201d</p><p>For Democrats, though, it was another year of frustration. After Burns opened the door to Medicaid expansion, the minority party worked feverishly to try to expand health coverage to lower-income adults. They even believed they had a deal with Senate leadership to bring forward a bill at the last minute, only to claim betrayal after it was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/georgia-medicaid-expansion-health-care-d5778a84b727c02b24ab7d0fc46b4923\">voted down in committee</a> by Republicans who said they wanted to support Kemp's struggling Pathways program that offers insurance only with proof of work or study.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is that Georgia\u2019s health care policy failures are deliberate choices made by Gov. Kemp and the Republican leadership in the legislature,\" outgoing House Minority Leader Gloria Butler, a Stone Mountain Democrat, told reporters. \"We were told to let them cook. We were told that if we were nice to Republicans and if we asked politely, Medicaid expansion would be on the table. But guess what? It is still on the table.\u201d</p>",

While it does mention health-related topics such as Medicaid expansion and health care policy failures, these are not the main focus of the document. The primary emphasis is on the contrasting priorities between Republicans and Democrats, tax cuts, immigration, and other legislative issues. Therefore, the document has some relevance to the topic of health but is not highly focused on it."
