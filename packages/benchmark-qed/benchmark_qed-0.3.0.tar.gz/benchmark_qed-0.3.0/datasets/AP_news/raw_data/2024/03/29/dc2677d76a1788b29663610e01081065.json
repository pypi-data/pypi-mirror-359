Thai authorities say they have been working closely with those in Laos after receiving reports of the outbreak and have prepared vaccines in case of infections being detected in Thailand. The Thai government says it has received reports that 54 people in Laos have been infected with the disease. No deaths have been reported. Anthrax is a rare but serious disease caused by bacteria that primarily affects grazing animals. It can spread to humans through contact with or consumption of the infected animals.",
