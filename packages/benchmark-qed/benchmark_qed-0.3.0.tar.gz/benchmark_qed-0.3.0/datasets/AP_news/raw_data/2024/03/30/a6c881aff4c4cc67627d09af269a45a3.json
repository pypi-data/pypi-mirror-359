The Osaka plant of Kobayashi Pharmaceutical Co. was investigated Saturday. Then on Sunday, a plant operated by the company's subsidiary in Kinokawa was raided. Kobayashi Pharmaceutical says little is known about the exact cause of the sicknesses, which include kidney failure. An investigation into the products is underway in cooperation with the government. The supplements all used \u201cbenikoji,\u201d a kind of red mold. Reports of health problems surfaced in 2023, although benikoji has been used in various products for years.",

NHK public television showed the officials walk into the factory.</p><p>The Wakayama plant took over the production of the supplements after Kobayashi Pharmaceutical closed another plant in nearby Osaka, which authorities searched on Saturday, NHK said.</p><p>Kobayashi Pharmaceutical spokesperson Yuko Tomiyama told reporters that the company is fully cooperating in the investigation.</p><p>The company says little is known about the exact cause of the sicknesses, which include kidney failure.</p><p>The supplements being investigated all used \u201cbenikoji,\u201d a kind of red mold, including Kobayashi Pharmaceuticals\u2019 pink pills called Benikoji Choleste Help, which were billed as helping lower cholesterol levels.</p><p>The Osaka-based Kobayashi Pharmaceutical said about a million packages were sold over the past three fiscal years. It also sold benikoji to other manufacturers, and some products have been exported.

Company president Akihiro Kobayashi has apologized for not having acted sooner.</p><p>On Friday, the company said five people had died and 114 people were being treated in hospitals after taking the products.</p><p>Japan's health ministry says the supplements could be responsible for the deaths and illnesses, and warned that the number of those affected could grow. The government has ordered a review of the approval system in response to the supplement-related illnesses.</p><p>Some analysts blame the recent deregulation initiatives, which simplified and sped up approval for health products to spur economic growth. Deaths from a mass-produced item is rare in Japan, as government checks over consumer products are relatively stringent.</p><p>___</p><p>This story corrects a previous version that said the supplements caused the deaths and illnesses, according to authorities.
