Singh referred questions on whether Russia had a role to the intelligence community, which is still investigating.</p><p>The official, who was not identified, was not part of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's official traveling delegation to Vilnius, Singh said, but was there \u201cseparately, attending meetings that were part of the NATO summit.\"</p><p>Singh did not say whether the affected defense official had to seek further medical care, retire or cease performing duties, citing medical privacy.</p><p>In February the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in its 2024 threat assessment found that it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that a foreign adversary was responsible for causing <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-government-and-politics-51ebd4f82664aacc5394c1863cd6a5f2\">the mysterious ailments</a> but noted that U.S. intelligence agencies had varying levels of confidence in that assessment.</p><p>State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters on Monday the department has confidence in that assessment.</p><p>\u201cIt has been the broad conclusion of the intelligence community since March 2023 that is unlikely a foreign adversary is responsible for these anomalous health incidents,\u201d Miller said. \"It\u2019s something that the intelligence community has investigated extensively and continues to look at. We will look at new information as it comes in and make assessments inside the State Department and with our intelligence community.\u201d</p><p>The foremost Cuba-based researcher of the incidents, Mitchell Vald\u00e9s-Sosa, told The Associated Press that the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d report had failed to provide any scientific basis to substantiate the existence of the Havana syndrome. Vald\u00e9s-Sosa, director of Cuba\u2019s Center for Neuroscience, is the de facto spokesperson on the issue for the Cuban health ministry, which arranged the interview.</p><p>\u201cI think that this journalistic investigation does not provide serious elements, especially that there is a new illness caused by a mysterious energy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe symptoms are very varied: balance problems, sleep problems, dizziness, difficulties concentrating, and many diseases can cause them.\u201d</p><p>In the past, Vald\u00e9s-Sosa <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/science-cuba-havana-physics-4316989d278ae353c42ef78033d9b2a5\">hasn\u2019t disputed</a> that diplomats become ill, but suggested that many of the cases consisted of ordinary illnesses that were erroneously blamed on the supposed phenomenon due to the high degree of public attention.</p><p>The Pentagon's health care system has established a registry for employees or dependents to report such incidents. In March, however, a five-year study by the National Institutes of Health found <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/havana-syndrome-diplomat-health-brain-ea64e5c59d57e44a19aab40ac1b91e0d\">no brain injuries or degeneration</a> among U.S. diplomats and other government employees who had Havana syndrome symptoms.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>Andrea Rodriguez contributed from Havana and AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee contributed from Washington.</p>",
