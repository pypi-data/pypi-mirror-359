    "description_summary": "The Florida Supreme Court has cleared the way for a ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. It's also giving voters a chance to remove restrictions in November and restore abortion rights in most cases. The court ruled 6-1 Monday to uphold the state\u2019s ban on most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, meaning a ban on six weeks could soon take effect. But under a separate ruling, the court allowed a ballot measure on abortions rights to go to voters. A six-week ban would likely have a major impact on women seeking abortions in Florida and throughout the South.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 The Florida Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for the state to ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant, while also giving voters a chance to remove restrictions in November.</p><p>The court, which was reshaped by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, ruled 6-1 to uphold the state's ban on most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, meaning a ban on six weeks could soon take effect. But under a separate 4-3 ruling, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/florida-abortion-marijuana-2024-election-supreme-court-ad831352cb90abd5bbc873f498cbf286\">the court allowed</a> a ballot measure to go to voters that would enshrine abortion rights in Florida's constitution.</p><p>The court\u2019s decisions <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-kamala-harris-abortion-c634452da5e103913982e1cc5a0cae78\">could be pivotal</a> in the presidential race and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-biden-2024-reproductive-rights-harris-494af752992ba88fa6e3d53fbd54f716\">congressional contests this year</a> by driving abortion-rights supporters to the polls. Since the U.S. Supreme Court <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0\">overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022</a>, voters in every state with an abortion-related ballot measure have favored the side backed by abortion rights supporters.</p><p>The 15-week ban, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-health-ron-desantis-florida-lifestyle-8e8fb722fcb84ae86fd6be17f48503a9\">signed by DeSantis in 2022,</a> has been enforced while it was challenged in court. The six-week ban, passed by the Legislature last year, was written so that it would not take effect until a month after the 2022 law was upheld.</p><p>Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union and others who challenged the law argued that the Florida Constitution\u2019s unique privacy clause for more than 40 years has explicitly protected a right to abortion in the state and should remain in force.</p><p>Lawyers for the state, however, said when the privacy clause was adopted by voter referendum in 1980, few people understood it would cover abortion. They told the justices the clause was mainly meant to cover \u201cinformational privacy\u201d such as personal records and not abortion.</p><p>The Florida justices agreed, saying that when voters approved the privacy clause, they didn't know it would affect abortion laws.</p><p>\u201cThe debate \u2014 as framed to the public \u2014 overwhelmingly associated the Privacy Clause\u2019s terms with concerns related to government surveillance and disclosure of private information to the public'\u201d the court wrote. \u201cProlife and prochoice groups did not join in the fray. These groups are not politically bashful\u2014 not now, and not in 1980.\u201d</p><p>DeSantis, who took office in 2019, appointed five of the court\u2019s seven justices.</p><p>Republican House Speaker Paul Renner said the six-week ban is a good fit for Florida and noted the law includes exceptions for cases involving rape, incest and fetal abnormalities, as well as to save a mother's life.</p><p>\"It is a compromise that addresses where I think many Floridians are.\u201d</p><p>Abortion rights proponents were disheartened by the ruling.</p><p>\u201cThis decision demonstrates how precarious our personal freedoms are in this state,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani. \u201cIt\u2019s so extreme you\u2019re going to see Floridians having to go out of state, probably to Virginia, to get care.\u201d</p><p>The Florida Access Network plans to switch its strategy from finding abortion care for women in Florida to paying for their travel expenses to go out of state, said Stephanie Loraine Pineiro, the advocacy group\u2019s executive director.</p><p>\u201cPeople who can\u2019t afford to travel, can\u2019t afford to lose their jobs because they have to travel for abortion care, these are the people who are going to be forced to remain pregnant,\u201d she said. \u201cThe collateral damage is all of us.\u201d</p><p>The proposed constitutional amendment that will be on the November ballot says \u201cno law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient\u2019s health, as determined by the patient\u2019s healthcare provider.\u201d It provides for one exception that is already in the state constitution: Parents must be notified before their minor children can get an abortion.</p><p>Most Republican-controlled states have adopted bans or restrictions on abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court's Dobbs decision.</p><p>A survey of abortion providers conducted for the Society of Family Planning, which advocates for abortion access, found that Florida had the second-largest increase in the total number of abortions provided since the Dobbs decision. The state\u2019s data shows that more than 7,700 women from other states received abortions in Florida in 2023.</p><p>Fourteen states, including nearby Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, now have bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions. Georgia and South Carolina bar it once cardiac activity can be detected, which is generally considered to be around six weeks into pregnancy.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, N.J.; Terry Spencer in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Stephany Matat in West Palm Beach; Mike Schneider in Orlando; Curt Anderson in St. Petersburg; and David Fischer in Miami contributed to this report.</p>",

While the primary focus is on legal and political aspects, the topic of abortion is inherently related to health, particularly women's reproductive health. The document also touches on the impact of these laws on women's ability to access healthcare and the potential need for out-of-state travel for abortion services, which are significant health-related concerns."
