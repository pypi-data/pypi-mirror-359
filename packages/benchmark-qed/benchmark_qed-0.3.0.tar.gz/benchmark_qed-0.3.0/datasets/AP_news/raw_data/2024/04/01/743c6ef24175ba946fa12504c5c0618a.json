It has connected with college students, elementary-school children and seniors that are particularly vulnerable. And its representatives are filling up lecture halls as they become a key voice in the effort to rid Taiwan of disinformation. Their particular specialty is older citizens, who are susceptible to a constantly updating technological landscape.

    "body_nitf": "<p>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) \u2014 Their days often began at the crack of dawn.</p><p>They\u2019d head out to a church, a temple, a park and set up a stall. They\u2019d seek out seniors in particular, those who are perhaps the most vulnerable citizens of the information-saturated society that has enveloped them. To get people to stop and listen, they\u2019d offer free bars of soap \u2014 a metaphor for the scrubbing that they were undertaking.</p><p>They\u2019d talk to people, ask them about their lives and their media consumption habits. They\u2019d ask: How has fake news hurt you? They\u2019d teach techniques to punch through the static, to see the illogic in conspiracy theories, to find the facts behind the false narratives that can sometimes shape our lives.</p><p>Nearly six years later, with just one formal employee and a team of volunteers, Fake News Cleaner has hosted more than 500 events, connecting with college students, elementary-school children \u2014 and the seniors that, some say, are the most vulnerable to such efforts.</p><p>Its people are filling up lecture halls and becoming a key voice in an effort as pressing here as anywhere: scrubbing Taiwan of disinformation and the problems it causes, one case at a time.</p><p>Like any democratic society, Taiwan is <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-election-china-disinformation-vote-fraud-4968ef08fd13821e359b8e195b12919c\">flooded with assorted types of disinformation</a>. It touches every aspect of a person\u2019s life, from conspiracy theories on vaccines to health claims aimed at promoting supplements to rumors about major Taiwanese companies leaving the island.</p><p>Despite its very public nature, disinformation has a deeply personal impact \u2014 particularly among Taiwan\u2019s older people. It thrives in the natural gaps between people that come from generational differences and a constantly updating tech landscape, then enlarges those gaps to cause rifts.</p><p>\u201cThey have no way to communicate,\u201d says Melody Hsieh, who co-founded the group with Shu-huai Chang in 2018. \u201cThis entire society is being torn apart, and this is a terrible thing.\u201d</p><p>Taiwan is already home to several established fact-checking organizations. There\u2019s Co-Facts, a well known AI-driven fact-checking bot founded by a group of civic hackers. There are the Taiwan Fact Check Center and MyGoPen. But such organizations presume that you\u2019re at least somewhat tech-savvy \u2014 that you can find a fact-check organization\u2019s website or add a fact-checking bot.</p><p>Yet many of the people most affected are the least tech-savvy. Fake News Cleaner believes addressing this gap requires an old-school approach: going offline. At the heart of the group\u2019s work is approaching people with patience and respect while educating them about the algorithms and norms that drive the platforms they use.</p><p>Hsieh says she was moved after seeing too many instances of division because of fake news: a couple that divorced, a mom who kicked her kid out of the house. Many such stories surfaced in 2018 when Taiwan held a national referendum on a number of social issues including on nuclear energy, sex education, and gay marriage.</p><p>At their second-ever event, Hsieh and Chang met a victim of fake news. A vegetable seller told them he\u2019d lost sales because people had read that the vegetable fern he planted and sold, known locally as guomao, caused cancer. Business faded, and the vendor had to sell off part of his land. For a year, even restaurants didn\u2019t order from him.</p><p>Keep up the work, he told them \u2014 it\u2019s needed.</p><p>At a community center hosted by Bangkah Church in Taipei\u2019s Wanhua neighborhood, a crowd of seniors listen to 28-year old Tseng Yu-huan speak on behalf of Fake News Cleaner.</p><p>The attendees, many of whom come daily to the church\u2019s college for seniors, are learning why fake news is so compelling. Tseng shows them some sensational headlines. One: A smoothie mix of sweet potato leaves and milk was said to be a detox drink. Another: rumors that COVID-19 was being spread from India because of dead bodies in rivers. He used mostly examples from Line, a Korean messaging app popular in Taiwan.</p><p>With just one formal employee and a team of volunteers, Fake News Cleaner has combed Taiwan\u2019s churches, temples, small fishing villages and parks, spreading awareness. While they started with a focus on seniors, the group has also lectured at colleges and even elementary schools. Early on, to catch their target audience, Hsieh and her co-founders would get to the hiking trails near her home by 5 a.m. to set up a stall while offering free bars of soap to entice people to stop and listen.</p><p>Now the group has a semester-long course at a community college in Kaohsiung, in addition to their lectures all across Taiwan, from fishing villages to community centers.</p><p>Fake News Cleaner avoids politics and takes no funding from the government or political parties. This is because of Taiwan\u2019s highly polarized political environment, where media outlets are often referred to by the color of the political party they back. Instead, the group focuses lectures on everyday topics like health and diet or economic scams.</p><p>The key is to teach people to think about what they\u2019re consuming, and not just reading a fact-checked article. \u201cWhat we are dealing with is not about true or false,\u201d says Tseng, the teacher. \u201cIt\u2019s actually about family relationships and tech.\u201d</p><p>At Bangkah Church, the audience watches Tseng as he lectures the audience about content farms, websites that aggregate content or generate their own articles regardless of the truth, and how these content farms make money. He also asks: Do the articles have bylines? Who wrote them?</p><p>Fake news relies on emotion to generate clicks. So often, headlines are sensational and appeal directly to three types of emotions: hatred, panic or surprise. A click or a page view means more money for the websites, Tseng explains. The retirees watch him, engrossed.</p><p>Many elderly people end up with expensive phones bought by their children that they don\u2019t know how to use, says Moon Chen, Fake News Cleaner\u2019s secretary-general. Sometimes their children open a Facebook or Line account for them but don\u2019t explain the phone\u2019s fundamentals.</p><p>That produces trouble.
