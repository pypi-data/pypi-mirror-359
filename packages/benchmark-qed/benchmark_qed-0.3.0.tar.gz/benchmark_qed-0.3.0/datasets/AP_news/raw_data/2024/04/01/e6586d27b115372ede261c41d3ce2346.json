    "description_summary": "Ohio's Republican Attorney General Dave Yost says a 2019 law banning most abortions in the state is unconstitutional. The attorney general's court filing on Monday comes after abortion clinics asked a Hamilton County judge to throw out the law since Ohio voters decided to enshrine abortion in the state constitution last November. The law bans most abortions once fetal cardiac activity can be detected, and clinics have argued the new constitutional amendment invalidates it. Yost mostly agrees. However, he has asked the court to only strike down the part of the law that bans abortions after six weeks and let other portions remain. These include requiring a doctor to check for a heartbeat and inform a patient.",

Attorney General Dave Yost, for the most part, agreed.</p><p>However, the attorney general asked the court to only strike down the \u201ccore prohibition\u201d of the law \u2014 banning abortions after six weeks \u2014 and let other portions remain. These include requiring a doctor to check for a heartbeat and inform a patient, as well as documenting the reason someone is having an abortion. Yost said in the filing that the plaintiffs have not demonstrated how such provisions violate the constitutional amendment.</p><p>The state \u201crespects the will of the people,\u201d a spokesperson for Yost's office said in an email, but is also obligated to prevent overreach and protect parts of the law the amendment doesn't address.</p><p>Freda Levenson, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, called the continued litigation \u201cquibbling about extraneous matters\u201d in an emailed statement, and disagreed that such issues have ever been a problem before in this case.</p><p>\u201cThis case should be over. Stick a fork in it,\u201d she said in the statement.</p><p>The law signed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in April 2019 prohibited most abortions after the first detectable \u201cfetal heartbeat.\u201d Cardiac activity can be detected as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant.</p><p>The ban, initially blocked through a federal legal challenge, briefly went into effect when the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision was overturned in 2022. It was then placed back on hold in county court, as part of a subsequent lawsuit challenging it as unconstitutional under the Ohio Constitution, eventually reaching the state Supreme Court.</p><p>In December 2023, the state's highest court dismissed an appeal brought by Yost's office \" <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/0/2023/2023-ohio-4580.pdf\">due to a change in the law</a>.\u201d This sent the case back to the lower courts, where it now resides.</p><p>The case now awaits a decision by Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas Judge Christian Jenkins.</p><p>___</p><p>Samantha Hendrickson is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
