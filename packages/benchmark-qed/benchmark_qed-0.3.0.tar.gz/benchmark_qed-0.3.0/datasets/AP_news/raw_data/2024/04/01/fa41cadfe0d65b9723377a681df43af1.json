    "description_summary": "Chemical manufacturer 3M will begin payments starting in the third quarter to many U.S. public drinking water systems as part of a multi-billion-dollar settlement over contamination with potentially harmful compounds used in firefighting foam and several consumer products. The Minnesota-based company said Monday that last year\u2019s lawsuit settlement received final approval from the U.S. District Court in Charleston, South Carolina. The amount paid out will range from $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion depending on what additional contamination is found. The deal compensates water providers for pollution with per- and polyfluorinated substances, known collectively as PFAS. PFAS are a broad class of chemicals used in nonstick, water- and grease-resistant products such as clothing and cookware.",

Depending on what additional contamination is found, the amount paid out will range from $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion.</p><p>\u201cThis is yet another important step forward for 3M as we continue to deliver on our priorities. The final approval of this settlement and continued progress toward exiting all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025 will further our efforts to reduce risk and uncertainty as we move forward,\u201d 3M's chairman and CEO, Mike Roman, said in a news release.</p><p>The deal compensates water providers for pollution with per- and polyfluorinated substances, known collectively as PFAS \u2014 a broad class of chemicals used in nonstick, water- and grease-resistant products such as clothing and cookware.</p><p>PFAS have been described as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they don\u2019t degrade naturally in the environment. They've been linked to a variety of health problems, including liver and immune-system damage and some cancers.</p><p>The compounds have been detected at varying levels in drinking water nationwide. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-pfas-forever-chemicals-water-contamination-regulations-560d0ce3321e7fa8ed052f792c24f16f\">The Environmental Protection Agency in March 2023 proposed strict limits on two common types</a>, PFOA and PFOS, and said it wanted to regulate four others. Water providers would be responsible for monitoring their systems for the chemicals.</p><p>The 3M settlement first announced in June came in a lawsuit by Stuart, Florida, one of about 300 communities that had filed similar suits against companies that produced firefighting foam or the PFAS it contained. The payment will help cover the costs of filtering PFAS from systems.</p><p>Some of the settlement money will help additional water systems test for contamination from PFAS, said Scott Summy, one of the lead attorneys for those suing 3M and other manufacturers. They have until June 2026 to apply for compensation if contamination is found.</p><p>\u201cThat's great news for American citizens who drink from that water,\u201d Summy said. \u201cIt'll help rid our public drinking water systems of PFAS, and that's the most important thing about the settlement.\u201d</p><p>Also, last June, DuPont de Nemours Inc. and spinoffs Chemours Co. and Corteva Inc. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pfas-forever-chemicals-dupont-drinking-water-82516dfef51da45b389e00fa956cf8c5\">reached a $1.18 billion deal</a> to resolve PFAS complaints by about 300 drinking water providers. Several states, airports, firefighter training facilities and private well owners also have sued.</p>",
