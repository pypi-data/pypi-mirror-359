Officials later saud the same infection was found at a poultry facility in Michigan. Mississippi-based Cal-Maine Foods said Tuesday it destroyed 1.6 million laying hens and 377,000 pullets at the Texas facility on the Texas-New Mexico border. Cal-Maine says there is no known risk with eggs in the market and no eggs have been recalled. In Michigan, the state Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said the infection was found in a commercial poultry facility there.",

Cal-Maine said it sells most of its eggs in the Southwestern, Southeastern, Midwestern and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.</p><p>\u201cThe Company continues to work closely with federal, state and local government officials and focused industry groups to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks and effectively manage the response,\u201d the statement said.</p><p>\"Cal-Maine Foods is working to secure production from other facilities to minimize disruption to its customers,\" the statement said.</p><p>The company said there is no known bird flu risk associated with eggs that are currently in the market and no eggs have been recalled.</p><p>Eggs that are properly handled and cooked are safe to eat, <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/avian-influenza-food-safety-qa.pdf\">according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</a></p><p>The announcement by Cal-Maine comes a day after <a href=\"https://apnews.com/355f1e288e72df8b81b0e2efd8b3ae2f\">state health officials said</a> a person had been diagnosed with bird flu after being in contact with cows presumed to be infected, and that the risk to the public remains low. The human case in Texas marks the first known instance globally of a person catching this version of bird flu from a mammal, federal health officials said.</p><p>In Michigan, Michigan State University\u2019s Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory has detected bird flu in a commercial poultry facility in Ionia County, according to the Michigan\u2019s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.</p><p>The county is about 100 miles (161 kilometers) northwest of Detroit.</p><p>The department said it received confirmation of the disease Monday from the lab and that it is the fourth time since 2022 that the disease was detected at a commercial facility in Michigan.</p><p>Department spokesperson Jennifer Holton said Tuesday that state law prohibits the department from disclosing the type of poultry at the facility. The facility has been placed under quarantine and the department does not anticipate any disruptions to supply chains across the state, Holton said.</p><p>Dairy cows in Texas and Kansas <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-dairy-cattle-usda-kansas-texas-c3040bb31a9a8293717d47362f006902\">were reported</a> to be infected with bird flu last week \u2014 and federal agriculture officials later confirmed infections in a Michigan dairy herd that had recently received cows from Texas. A dairy herd in Idaho has been added to the list after federal agriculture officials confirmed the detection of bird flu in them, according to a Tuesday press release from the USDA.</p><p>_____ Associated Press writer Corey Williams in Detroit contributed to this report.</p>",

It also mentions related bird flu cases in Michigan and the infection of dairy cows in Texas, Kansas, and Idaho. While the primary focus is on the agricultural and economic impact, the document also touches on public health aspects, such as the safety of consuming eggs and a human case of bird flu. Therefore, the document is relevant to the topic of health, particularly in the context of zoonotic diseases and food safety."
