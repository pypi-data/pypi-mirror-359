Outbreaks of bird flu were reported at poultry facilities in both Michigan and Texas, and infected dairy cows have been discovered in at least five states. There has also been a report in Texas of a person catching bird flu from a mammal, which is the first known instance of this happening. There has been only one reported case of bird flu in a person in the U.S., and that was in 2022 when a prison inmate in a work program in Colorado caught it while killing infected birds.",

The latest developments on the virus also include <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-dairy-cattle-usda-kansas-texas-c3040bb31a9a8293717d47362f006902\">infected dairy cows</a> and the first known instance of a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-texas-cows-355f1e288e72df8b81b0e2efd8b3ae2f\">human catching bird flu</a> from a mammal.</p><p>Although health officials say the risk to the public remains low, there is rising concern, emerging in part from news that the largest producer of fresh eggs in the U.S. reported an outbreak.</p><p>Here are some key things to know about the disease.</p><hl2>WHAT ARE EXPERTS SAYING?</hl2><p>Dr. Mandy Cohen, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency is taking bird flu seriously, but stressed that the virus has already been well studied.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that it is in cattle now definitely raises our concern level,\u201d Cohen said, noting that it means farmworkers who work with cattle \u2014 and not just those working with birds \u2014 may need to take precautions.</p><p>The good news is that \u201cit\u2019s not a new strain of the virus,\u201d Cohen added. \u201cThis is known to us and we\u2019ve been studying it, and frankly, we\u2019ve been preparing for avian flu for 20 years.\u201d</p><hl2>WHAT IS BIRD FLU?</hl2><p>Some flu viruses mainly affect people, but others chiefly occur in animals. Avian viruses spread naturally in wild aquatic birds like ducks and geese, and then to chickens and other domesticated poultry.</p><p>The bird flu virus drawing attention today \u2014 Type A H5N1 \u2014 was first identified in 1959. Like other viruses, it has evolved over time, spawning newer versions of itself.</p><p>Since 2020, the virus has been spreading among <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/disease-outbreaks-hong-kong-health-bird-flu-animals-75e5d058e0fda23b5359f66cafb74cdf\">more animal species</a> \u2014 including dogs, cats, skunks, bears and even <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/seals-bird-flu-deaths-oceans-80184a8793fbcc21fab01b1c90b0d71b\">seals</a> and porpoises \u2014 in scores of countries.</p><p>In the U.S., this version of the bird flu has been detected in wild birds in every state, as well as commercial poultry operations and backyard flocks. Nationwide, tens of millions of chickens have died from the virus or been killed to stop outbreaks from spreading.</p><p>Last week, U.S. officials said it had been found in livestock. As of Tuesday, it had been discovered in dairy herds <a href=\"https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/agency-announcements/usda-confirms-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-dairy-herd-idaho\">in five states</a> \u2014 Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico and Texas \u2014 according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p><hl2>HOW OFTEN DO PEOPLE GET BIRD FLU?</hl2><p>This bird flu was first identified as a threat to people during a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong. In the past two decades, nearly 900 people have been diagnosed globally with bird flu and more than 460 people have died, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/surveillance/avian-influenza\">according to the World Health Organization</a>.</p><p>There have been only two cases in the U.S., and neither were fatal.</p><p>In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-health-environment-colorado-b98906e0a1899bb1f92da30a7b1dbe28\">caught it</a> while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered.</p><p>This week, Texas health officials <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-texas-cows-355f1e288e72df8b81b0e2efd8b3ae2f\">announced</a> that a person who had been in contact with cows had been diagnosed with bird flu. Their only reported symptom was eye redness.</p><hl2>WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF BIRD FLU?</hl2><p>Symptoms are similar to that of other flus, including cough, body aches and fever. Some people don\u2019t have noticeable symptoms, but others develop severe, life-threatening pneumonia.</p><hl2>CAN IT SPREAD BETWEEN PEOPLE?</hl2><p>The vast majority of infected people have gotten it directly from birds, but scientists are on guard for any sign of spread among people.</p><p>There have been a few instances when that apparently happened \u2014 most recently in 2007 in Asia. In each cluster, it spread within families from a sick person in the home.</p><p>U.S. health officials have stressed that the current public health risk <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/avian-flu-summary.htm\">is low</a> and that there is no sign that bird flu is spreading person to person.</p><hl2>WHAT IS THE ECONOMIC IMPACT?</hl2><p>While it's too early to quantify the potential economic impact of a bird flu outbreak, many of these latest developments are concerning, particularly the transmission of the virus from one species to another, said Darin Detwiler, a food safety and policy expert at Northeastern University.</p><p>\u201cWe don't have a magic forcefield, an invisible shield that protects land and water runoff from impacting other species,\u201d Detwiler said. \u201cThere is a concern in terms of how this might impact other markets, the egg market, the beef market.\u201d</p><p>If the outbreak is not quickly contained, consumers could ultimately see higher prices, and if it continues to spread, some industries could experience \u201creputational strain,\" possibly affecting the export industry, Detwiler added.</p><p>The egg industry already is experiencing some tightening of supply following detections of bird flu late in 2023 and in early January, coupled with the busy Easter season, where Americans typically consume an average of 3 billion eggs, said Marc Dresner, a spokesperson for the American Egg Board.</p><p>Still, even with the outbreak in Texas and the nearly 2 million birds that were killed there, Dresner said there are an estimated 310 million egg laying hens in the U.S. and wholesale egg prices are down about 25% from a February peak.</p><p>___</p><p>This story was initially published on April 3. It was updated on April 24 to correct the spelling of Darin Detwiler's first name, which had been misspelled \u201cDaren.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press reporters Jonathan Poet in Philadelphia and Mike Stobbe and videojournalist Sharon Johnson in Atlanta contributed to this report.</p>",
