    "description_summary": "A Florida ban on abortions earlier in pregnancy is expected to have an impact on providers in other parts of the country. A state Supreme Court ruling this week clears the way for a law to take effect banning abortion after the first six weeks of pregnancy. Most of the South already have bans that strict or stricter. So Instead of being able to get an abortion in Florida, people from the state and others nearby will have to travel farther. The nearest clinic to offer abortion later in pregnancy without a three-day wait will be in Virginia. The administrative director there is expecting more patients from Florida.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>The drive to Bristol, Virginia, from Jacksonville, Florida, takes more than eight hours. It's over 10 from Orlando and closer to 14 from Miami. Despite that distance, Bristol Women\u2019s Health Center is preparing for an influx of women from Florida seeking abortions when a stricter ban kicks in next month.</p><p>For many people who otherwise would have obtained abortions in Florida, the clinic in southwest Virginia will become the closest practical option \u2014 as it already is for a swath of the South after a Florida policy change expected to resonate far beyond the state's borders.</p><p>\u201cThe majority of the patients we do serve are coming from banned states,\u201d said Karolina Ogorek, the clinic\u2019s administrative director. \u201cI think that Florida will just become another one of the states that we serve.\u201d</p><p>On Monday, the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/florida-abortion-ban-supreme-court-ruling-6a4949fc7459afe9b5e298086a793126#:~:text=The%2015%2Dweek%20ban%2C%20signed,the%202022%20law%20was%20upheld.\">Florida Supreme Court</a> upheld the state's ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. That step allows another, stricter ban to take effect on May 1, making abortion illegal in the state after six weeks' gestation \u2014 before many women realize they're pregnant. The ban includes exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape, incest or human trafficking, or that threaten the life or physical health or the woman and for fatal fetal anomalies.</p><p>In a separate but closely related ruling, the court also allowed a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/florida-2024-election-donald-trump-joe-biden-ron-desantis-abortion-1f891a163e15d3c8f4fc6ba9bb647b97\">referendum that will let the state\u2019s voters</a> decide in November whether they want an amendment to the state constitution allowing abortion until viability.</p><p>Stephanie Loraine Pi\u00f1eiro, executive director of the Florida Access Network, which helps pay for abortion care for Florida women, said that the law coupled with a 24-hour waiting period for abortion will be a \u201ctotal ban\u201d in practical terms.</p><p>And getting to a provider elsewhere, she said, will drive the average cost of abortion \u2014 including transportation, lodging, meals, child care and clinic fees \u2014 to around $4,000, about twice what it is now. That will strain organizations like hers, which already often hits its budget limit well before the end of the month, as they shift to helping people get care elsewhere.</p><p>That could strand people who can't get time off work, afford travel, arrange child care or lack documentation to travel, Pi\u00f1eiro said.</p><p>\u201cThe people who are most marginalized are going to cotinine to not have access,\u201d she said.</p><p>She said she expects some of the state\u2019s clinics to close for lack of patients.</p><p>Currently, the average distance to a facility that provides abortion for Florida residents is 20 miles (32 kilometers), said Caitlin Myers, an economics professor at Middlebury College in Vermont who studies the impact of abortion bans. But when the new ban takes effect, the average distance to one that offers abortion after the first six weeks of pregnancy will be 584 miles (940 kilometers).</p><p>And that only gets patients to North Carolina, where two in-person visits are required 72 hours apart to receive an abortion \u2014 and only for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy in most cases.</p><p>It's more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) farther to Virginia.</p><p>Some areas already have long drives to the nearest abortion providers \u2014 eight hours from San Antonio, Texas, to Santa Teresa, New Mexico, for instance, and nine from New Orleans to Carbondale, Illinois, or Houston to Wichita, Kansas. But the geography will make South Florida the most highly populated place in the U.S. that's farthest from in-person abortion access past the first six weeks.</p><p>Georgia and South Carolina, which have bans that begin after about six weeks and Ohio, which had a similar one for a time, have seen in the neighborhood of half as many abortions with those policies in effect. Some people are able to obtain abortion close to home earlier in pregnancy rather than traveling.</p><p>It's not only Florida residents who will be affected by the new ban.</p><p>\u201cFlorida is a really important state for Southern abortion access, and it has been a state that has experienced a surge in travelers from Georgia and Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana who are traveling out of those states, avoiding near total or six-week bans to facilities,\u201d Myers said.</p><p>Of the 84,000 abortions provided in Florida last year, about 7,700 were for people who live out of state. Now most of those patients will travel farther for access, too.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-survey-wecount-telehealth-ban-e3c7c9539462eb924ad92f30c624f311\">total number of abortions</a> in the country has been roughly stable since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended a nationwide right to abortion in 2022. But the details have changed.</p><p>Far more are provided by pills rather than surgery, with a major increase in prescriptions through telehealth \u2014 including to patients in states with bans from providers where laws seek to protect such prescriptions. But there could be legal tests of whether those protections are valid. And the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-abortion-mifepristone-telemedicine-4406d53e8af90f6a523264f535f5adf8\">U.S. Supreme Court is already considering</a> an effort to roll back approvals for one of the two drugs usually used in combination for medication abortion.</p><p>Planned Parenthood centers in Florida have been preparing for the stricter ban to take effect. Laura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, said they've implemented rapid blood tests to determine pregnancy earlier, increased education and contraception programs, and ramped up efforts to help people travel elsewhere for abortion.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing what we can,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve as we\u2019ve seen in other states, it\u2019s still going to have a devastating impact on our public health system.\u201d</p><p>Since states began enforcing bans after the 2022 ruling, the Bristol clinic has added appointment slots in afternoons, Saturdays and some Sundays \u2014 and has adjusted to the idea that patients could be late because of traffic jams as far away as Atlanta.</p><p>\u201cIn order for them to come to Virginia, there\u2019s a lot of planning involved,\u201d Ogorek said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just taking a few hours off of work and driving 20 minutes\u201d</p>",
