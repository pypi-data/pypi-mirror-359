KTVB-TV reports that in response, protesters on Tuesday sent more than 48,000 colorful paper hearts raining down from the fourth floor of the Statehouse to the first-floor rotunda. The hearts symbolize the 48,000 Idaho residents who identified as LGBTQ+ in the 2020 census. On Wednesday, the Senate approved a bill allowing people to sue schools and libraries over books deemed harmful to minors.",

Brad Little. Another bill that Little signed into law last week prevents public funds \u2014 including Medicaid \u2014 from being <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-care-medicaid-ban-lawsuit-idaho-754f203fb4e8d5d8c0becc8135c48284\">used for gender-affirming care</a>.</p><p>The efforts are part of an ongoing national battle over the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/lgbtq-rights-dont-say-gay-licenses-d0bf9d2f314ec6f28f2189795ea2d56c\">rights of LGBTQ+ Americans</a>. Many Republican officials have been actively trying to limit those rights over the past several years.</p><p>The legislation in Idaho was among at least nine bills directly targeting LGBTQ+ rights that have been proposed in the state so far this year, Rebecca De Le\u00f3n, spokesperson for the ACLU of Idaho, told the <a href=\"https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article287320575.html\">Idaho Statesman</a>. In response to the slew of actions, protesters sent <a href=\"https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/local/thousands-paper-hearts-thrown-inside-capitol-protest-anti-lgbtq-legislation/277-e210531a-5f8f-41a3-a6ec-8ec0a5bc1cba\">more than 48,000 colorful paper hearts</a> raining down from the fourth floor of the Statehouse to the first-floor rotunda on Tuesday, KTVB-TV reported.</p><p>The hearts symbolized the 48,000 Idaho residents who identified as part of the LGBTQ+ population in the 2020 census. The hearts were handmade and mailed to the ACLU from 18 cities across the state.</p><p>\u201cWe wanted specifically lawmakers to be able to see the hearts and to hear what we have been trying to tell them all session,\u201d De Le\u00f3n told the Statesman. \u201cIt feels like they have not been listening, so we wanted to come bring the hearts to them.\u201d</p><p>Republican Rep. Julianne Young sponsored the bill redefining gender, which refers to social and self-identity, as being synonymous with sex, which refers to biological traits. At least 12 other states have considered similar legislation this year attempting to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/states-define-sex-transgender-dc8c48669aef760c68d2fb7abde10e8c?utm_source=copy&utm_medium=share\">remove nonbinary and transgender</a> concepts from statutes. Kansas enacted a law last year ending legal recognition of transgender identities.</p><p>Idaho's library bill allows community members to file written requests to remove materials they consider harmful to minors to an adults-only section, and gives library officials 60 days to make the change. After that point, the community member could sue for damages.</p><p>The governor vetoed a similar bill last year, saying he feared it would create a bounty system that would increase libraries' costs, ultimately raising prices for taxpayers.</p><p>The ACLU and other opponents of the new law preventing public money from being used for gender-affirming care say it most likely will lead to a federal lawsuit. Idaho is already embroiled in lawsuits over attempts to deny gender-affirming care to transgender residents and has not had much success so far in defending them.</p>",

While there is a mention of health-related issues, such as the prohibition of public funds for gender-affirming care and Medicaid, the overall focus is on the political and social implications of these laws rather than health itself. Therefore, the document is only somewhat relevant to the topic of health."
