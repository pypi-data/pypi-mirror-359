That's according to the director of Motol University Hospital in Prague, who says Zeman will now recuperate at home. Doctors at the clinic discovered during a medical check on March 14 that Zeman had an insufficient blood supply in one of his legs because of the blood clot and immediately operated on him. The supply of blood was restored during the operation but Zeman remained in serious but stable condition for days. Zeman\u2019s second and final term in the largely ceremonial post of president ended in March last year.",
