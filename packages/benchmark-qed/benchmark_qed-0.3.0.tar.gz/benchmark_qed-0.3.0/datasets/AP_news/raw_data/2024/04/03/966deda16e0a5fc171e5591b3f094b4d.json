Finally.\u201d</p><p>Both men touted the lower health care costs that come through the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-signs-climate-health-bill-9a7f349fa7b07387d20ad603f2ff4875\">Democrats\u2019 sweeping climate, health care and tax package</a> that Biden signed into law in 2022. It caps various health care costs for those on Medicare, including $35 a month for insulin and $2,000 a year for prescription drugs. No Republican lawmakers voted for the law.</p><p>His aides and Democratic officials say Biden\u2019s achievements such as lowering health care costs are popular with the public, yet the incumbent president <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-poll-survey-economy-trump-election-dca1b60f6749d5eb50bc0e7600814855\">hasn\u2019t yet gotten the credit</a> from voters. Sanders has a loyal following that supports his calls to reign in medical costs in the U.S. and give the government more control over the health care industry.</p><p>The top drugmaker lobby called Biden\u2019s comments Wednesday a \u201cmissed opportunity,\u201d saying he failed to address how some other industries, like health insurance companies, are also driving up the cost of medications.</p><p>Both Biden and Sanders also promoted their recent efforts to pressure most major inhaler manufacturers to cap the costs of the devices to no more than $35 a month. Otherwise, the purchase price of inhalers ranges somewhere between $200 to $600 without insurance, according to the White House. Manufacturers have said the price changes will take effect later this year or at the beginning of next year.</p><p>\u201cI want to thank President Biden for what he has done on this issue up to now, and I look forward to working with the president as we go forward,\u201d Sanders said.</p><p>Sanders, a Vermont independent, and Biden were rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. After Sanders ended his bid, his aides worked with Biden campaign officials to craft a party policy platform that would reflect Sanders\u2019 influence.</p><p>---</p><p>Associated Press writers Seung Min Kim and Amanda Seitz contributed to this report.</p>",
