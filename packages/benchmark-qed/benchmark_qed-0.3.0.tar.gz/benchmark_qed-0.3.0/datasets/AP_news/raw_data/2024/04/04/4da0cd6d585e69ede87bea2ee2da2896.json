    "description_summary": "Indiana's Court of Appeals says the state's near total ban on abortion may infringe on the religious freedom of some residents. The ruling released Thursday is tied to a lawsuit challenging the ban and filed by four residents and the group Hoosier Jews for Choice. The three-judge panel agreed with a county judge's previous ruling that residents whose sincerely held religious beliefs may require them to obtain an abortion should be exempt from the ban. The ruling does not have an immediate effect. It may be challenged to the state Supreme Court, which upheld the abortion ban last year in a separate legal challenge.",

But the written decision had no immediate effect and may be challenged in the state Supreme Court within the next 45 days.</p><p>Indiana\u2019s near total abortion ban went into effect in August after the Indiana Supreme Court upheld it, ending a separate legal challenge.</p><p>The religious challenge against the ban was brought by four residents and the group Hoosier Jews for Choice in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-lawsuits-indiana-religion-american-civil-liberties-union-655bff81c7f4d7c02554559b7fdc1b01\">September 2022</a>, saying it violates a state religious-freedom law <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/arkansas-discrimination-asa-hutchinson-indiana-michael-pence-f18271e04eda43b6a3017d1844268aae\">Republican lawmakers approved in 2015</a>.

Indiana later <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-indiana-government-and-politics-a987c724aa4502bca17f4eb34b7b1860\">appealed the decision</a>.</p><p>\u201cFor many Hoosiers, the ability to obtain an abortion is necessary based on a sincerely held religious belief,\u201d said Ken Falk, ACLU of Indiana Legal Director, in a statement.</p><p>The appeals court ordered the trial court to \u201cnarrow\u201d the earlier preliminary injunction only to residents who according to their sincerely held religious beliefs require an abortion. The order also affirmed class certification in the case, which the state challenged.</p><p>The ACLU\u2019s lawsuit argues that the ban violates Jewish teaching that \u201ca fetus attains the status of a living person only at birth\u201d and that \u201cJewish law stresses the necessity of protecting the life and physical and mental health of the mother prior to birth as the fetus is not yet deemed to be a person.\u201d It also cites theological teachings allowing abortion in at least some circumstances by Islamic, Episcopal, Unitarian Universalist and Pagan faiths.</p><p>\u201cWe are dealing with a very favorable decision that is not yet final,\u201d Falk said when speaking to reporters Thursday. Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita\u2019s office did not immediately comment on the ruling.</p><p>The appeals court panel consistently sided with the residents over the state of Indiana fighting the injunction. The judges agreed with the original county judge that for the plaintiffs, obtaining an abortion when directed by their sincere religious beliefs \u201cis their exercise of religion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey also have shown their sexual and reproductive lives will continue to be restricted absent the injunction,\" the order said.</p><p>A judge heard arguments in a similar lawsuit in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-lawsuit-religious-leaders-missouri-c0332a5d0d0a5671afcd7e6640a15f7d\">Missouri</a> in November, in which 13 Christian, Jewish and Unitarian Universalist leaders are seeking a permanent injunction barring Missouri\u2019s abortion law.

While the primary focus is on the legal and religious aspects of the case, the topic of abortion is inherently related to health, particularly reproductive health. The document also mentions the impact of the ban on the physical and mental health of women, which ties directly into health concerns. However, the primary emphasis is on the legal proceedings and religious arguments rather than health itself."
