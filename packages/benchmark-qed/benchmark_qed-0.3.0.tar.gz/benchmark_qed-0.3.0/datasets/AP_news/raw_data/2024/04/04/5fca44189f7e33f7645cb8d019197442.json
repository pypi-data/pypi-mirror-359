    "description_summary": "The maker of a drug for Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease that recently failed in a study says it will pull the medicine from the U.S. market. Amylyx Pharmaceuticals said Thursday it will halt marketing in the U.S. and Canada. In March, the drugmaker announced that its drug had failed to show any benefit for patients in a 600-person study. The drug\u2019s failure is a major disappointment for ALS patients and advocates who pressed the FDA to approve it. Amylyx's voluntary withdrawal resolves a potential dilemma for the FDA, which had no way of quickly forcing the drug from the U.S. market. That's because regulators granted the drug full approval in 2022, despite the Cambridge, Massachusetts, company presenting only preliminary study results.",

Patients already taking the therapy who wish to continue will be able to enroll in a program to receive it for free.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration approved the much-debated drug, Relyvrio, in September 2022, following a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/science-business-health-lobbying-congress-08f90cb109edd90fd7dd94d608960a05\">years-long advocacy campaign</a> by patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.</p><p>The drug's failure is a bitter disappointment for patients and advocates, who have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-business-drug-trials-congress-government-and-politics-905274f1b83c87d28771c9ddaefb5aa1\">pressed the FDA and other federal agencies</a> to fund and approve more experimental therapies for the fatal muscle-wasting disease.</p><p>Relyvrio's withdrawal leaves just three <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/als-drug-fda-approval-54ec2766f7fef61e68b715ca36a71755\">ALS medicines</a> available to U.S. patients, only one of which has been shown to extend survival by several months.</p><p>Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Amylyx also said Thursday it will lay off 70% of its more than 350 employees as part of a major restructuring effort. Company executives said they plan to continue studying Relyvrio and another experimental drug for several rare diseases, including Wolfram syndrome, which causes childhood diabetes and blindness.</p><p>Company shares climbed more than 7.5% in trading Thursday morning.</p><p>Amylyx said last month it was considering pulling its drug after a clinical trial in 600 patients failed to show any improvements in survival or other health measures, such as muscle strength or walking ability.</p><p>The company's voluntary action resolves what could have been a major dilemma for the FDA. The agency's regulators would not have had a clear path to quickly force the drug from the market if the company had refused to remove it. That's because the FDA granted the drug full approval, despite the preliminary nature of the company's data on effectiveness.</p><p>The 2022 approval was mainly based on results from one small, mid-stage study that was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/science-business-health-lou-gehrigs-disease-6ba188f586bdd0726aec031cdaaa7643\">criticized</a> by some of the agency\u2019s own internal scientists. Normally the agency requires two large, late-stage studies that show a clear benefit before granting approval. But at the time FDA officials explained that \u201cregulatory flexibility\u201d was appropriate when reviewing Relyvrio, \u201cgiven the serious and life-threatening nature of ALS and the substantial unmet need.\u201d</p><p>The medication is part of a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/9c4e469479ea438eb42957ba6ecd4710\">string</a> of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cbf99519cea3c6762a7dc36f7bc55141\">drugs</a> for deadly, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/science-government-and-politics-business-health-2147d824af9cfde629041d83d9ca7a8d\">degenerative</a> diseases that have won FDA approval in recent years despite questionable evidence they work.</p><p>ALS gradually destroys the nerve cells and connections needed to walk, talk, speak and breathe. Most patients die within three to five years of a diagnosis.</p><p>Relyvrio is a powder that combines two older drugs: a prescription medication for liver disorders and a dietary supplement associated with traditional Chinese medicine.</p><p>Amylyx faced criticism for pricing the drug at $158,000 for a year\u2019s supply. Sales were disappointing, with some patients discontinuing the medicine after only a few months.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
