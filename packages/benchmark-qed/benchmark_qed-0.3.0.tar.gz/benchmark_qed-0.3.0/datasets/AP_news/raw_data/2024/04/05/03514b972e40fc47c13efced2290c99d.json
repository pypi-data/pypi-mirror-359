    "description_summary": "The leader of struggling telemedicine provider Teladoc Health has left effective immediately, the company announced Friday. Teladoc gave no reason for the departure of CEO Jason Gorevic. The 52-year-old executive had led the company and served as a director since 2009. Teladoc lost $220 million last year. Its share price has plunged more than 90% since topping $300 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2021. Teladoc shares soared initially after COVID hit as doctor offices shut down and telemedicine exploded in popularity. But competition has since increased, and Teladoc has struggled with a shift in focus.",
