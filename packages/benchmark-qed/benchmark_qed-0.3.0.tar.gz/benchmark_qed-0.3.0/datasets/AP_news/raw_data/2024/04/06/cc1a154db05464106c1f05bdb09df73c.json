At 111 years old, Englishman John Alfred Tinniswood has been confirmed as the new holder of the title by Guinness World Records. It follows the death of the Venezuelan record-holder, Juan Vicente P\u00e9rez, this month at the age of 114. Born in Liverpool in 1912 a few months after the sinking of the Titanic, Tinniswood is a retired accountant who lived through two world wars. He says moderation is key to a healthy life. He never smokes, rarely drinks and follows no special diet, apart from a fish and chip supper once a week. But ultimately, he says, \u201cit\u2019s pure luck.\"",
