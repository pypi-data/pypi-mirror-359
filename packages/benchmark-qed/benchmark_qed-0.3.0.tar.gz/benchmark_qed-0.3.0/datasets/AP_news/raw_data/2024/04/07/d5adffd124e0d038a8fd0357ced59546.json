    "description_summary": "Researchers have found that most cancer drugs granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration do not deliver on their early promise. The program allows the FDA to grant early approval to drugs that show favorable initial results against debilitating or fatal diseases. In exchange, drug companies are expected to do rigorous testing and produce better evidence before gaining full approval. The study found that between 2013 and 2017, there were 46 cancer drugs granted accelerated approval. Of those, only 43% demonstrated they improved or extended patients' lives in confirmatory trials. The research was published Sunday.",

But how often do these drugs actually improve or extend patients\u2019 lives?</p><p>In a new study, researchers found that most cancer drugs granted accelerated approval do not demonstrate such benefits within five years.</p><p>\u201cFive years after the initial accelerated approval, you should have a definitive answer,\u201d said Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a cancer specialist and bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the research. \u201cThousands of people are getting those drugs. That seems a mistake if we don\u2019t know whether they work or not.\"</p><p>The program was created in 1992 to speed access to HIV drugs. Today, 85% of accelerated approvals go to cancer drugs.</p><p>It allows the FDA to grant early approval to drugs that show promising initial results for treating debilitating or fatal diseases. In exchange, drug companies are expected to do rigorous testing and produce better evidence before gaining full approval.</p><p>Patients get access to drugs earlier, but the tradeoff means some of the medications don\u2019t pan out. It's up to the FDA or the drugmaker to withdraw disappointing drugs, and sometimes the FDA has decided that less definitive evidence is good enough for a full approval.</p><p>The new study found that between 2013 and 2017, there were 46 cancer drugs granted accelerated approval. Of those, 63% were converted to regular approval even though only 43% demonstrated a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.</p><p>The research was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and discussed at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting in San Diego on Sunday.</p><p>It's unclear how much cancer patients understand about drugs with accelerated approval, said study co-author Dr. Edward Cliff of Harvard Medical School.</p><p>\u201cWe raise the question: Is that uncertainty being conveyed to patients?\u201d Cliff said.</p><p>Drugs that got accelerated approval may be the only option for patients with rare or advanced cancers, said Dr. Jennifer Litton of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who was not involved in the study.</p><p>It\u2019s important for doctors to carefully explain the evidence, Litton said.</p><p>\u201cIt might be shrinking of tumor. It might be how long the tumor stays stable,\u201d Litton said. \u201cYou can provide the data you have, but you shouldn\u2019t overpromise.\u201d</p><p>Congress recently updated the program, giving the FDA more authority and streamlining the process for withdrawing drugs when companies don\u2019t meet their commitments.</p><p>The changes allow the agency \u201cto withdraw approval for a drug approved under accelerated approval, when appropriate, more quickly,\u201d FDA spokesperson Cherie Duvall-Jones wrote in an email. The FDA can now require that a confirmatory trial be underway when it grants preliminary approval, which speeds up the process of verifying whether a drug works, she said.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
