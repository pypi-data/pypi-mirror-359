    "description_summary": "As he campaigns for a second term, President Joe Biden is highlighting how women\u2019s health has been affected by the overturning of federal abortion protections. And now his campaign is getting help from two women who say abortion restrictions put them in medical peril. Amanda Zurawski of Texas and Kaitlyn Joshua of Louisiana say their personal experiences are driving them to campaign for the Democratic president in North Carolina and Wisconsin over the next two weeks. The Biden team sees their stories as potent firsthand accounts as abortion restrictions pushed by Republicans complicate health care. Republicans, including Donald Trump, are struggling to figure out how to talk about the issue, if at all.",

The Biden campaign sees their stories as potent firsthand accounts of the growing medical peril for many women as abortion restrictions pushed by Republicans complicate health care.</p><p>\u201cThe abortion topic is a very heavy topic, and I understand that, said Joshua, 31, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. \u201dBut I also understand and believe that the Biden and Harris administration is the only administration that could do anything remotely close to addressing the abortion bans ... and then also doing a deeper dive into research and understanding women\u2019s health in general.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-kamala-harris-abortion-c634452da5e103913982e1cc5a0cae78\">Biden and Democrats see reproductive health</a> as a major driver for the 2024 election as the president and his proxies blame Republican Donald Trump, whose judicial nominations paved the way for the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority decision in 2022 that overturned abortion rights codified by <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0\">Roe v.

Trump has both taken credit for the overturning of Roe and suggested <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-abortion-ban-15-weeks-91a9e0ce87d11dff0fa761f327bd0566\">abortion should be legal until 15 weeks</a>, and has promised to make a statement outlining his policies this week.</p><p>Since the high court's ruling, voters have approved a number of statewide ballot initiatives to preserve or expand the right to abortion. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-abortion-inflation-health-religion-9c15e24b280fe9c65f4f0c3ab4febb2a\">Support for abortion access</a> drove women to the polls during the 2022 midterm elections, delivering Democrats unexpected success.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-poll-roe-dobbs-ban-opinion-fcfdfc5a799ac3be617d99999e92eabe\">About two-thirds of Americans</a> say abortion should generally be legal, according to polling by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only about one-quarter say abortion should always be legal and only about 1 in 10 say it should always be illegal.</p><p>Joshua and her husband were excited to be having a second baby. But she started to experience bleeding and serious pain at about 11 weeks. She suspected she was miscarrying.</p><p>At an emergency room in Baton Rouge, doctors examined her but wouldn't confirm she was miscarrying or discuss medical options, she said. She was sent home to wait. The bleeding worsened, and she went to a second hospital where again, doctors sent her home and told her to contact her doctor in a few days. A midwife eventually confirmed that Joshua had miscarried.</p><p>\u201cSomething that sounds as simple as dealing with a miscarriage can\u2019t even be met with a true diagnosis anymore,\u201d Joshua said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of wild, right? And it\u2019s really frightening.\u201d</p><p>Joshua and Zurawski will be in Raleigh, Durham and Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday, a state Biden hopes to flip. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-veto-override-north-carolina-4282913637b499490494dd3e3cce3478\">The state has enacted a law banning</a> most abortions after 12 weeks, overriding a veto from the Democratic governor.</p><p>The week after that, they will visit Milwaukee, Eau Claire and Madison, Wisconsin, a state Biden won in 2020. Republicans in the state Assembly tried to set up <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-abortion-14-weeks-pregnancy-bill-f7ebe31fc87f11a05127ed1e5b5ee155\">a statewide referendum</a> on the April ballot banning abortion after 14 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 more restrictive than current law \u2014 but the legislative session ended without a state Senate vote.</p><p>Both women said they felt compelled to get into politics after their own experiences.</p><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t get how bad it is, and they don\u2019t get how bleak it is,\" Zurawski said. \u201cAnd so the more we continue to share our stories. ... I think it\u2019s really important to spread awareness and paint this picture.\u201d</p><p>Zurawski, 37, of Austin <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/women-sue-texas-over-abortion-ban-632fad72e0f5b255a3a55274cd097fa9\">sued Texas last year after she and other women</a> could not get medical care because of the state's abortion laws. She had been in her second trimester, after 18 months of fertility treatments, when she went into early labor and was told the baby would not survive. Doctors said they could not intervene to provide an abortion because Zurawski wasn't in enough medical danger.</p><p>Zurawski had to wait. Three days later, her condition rapidly worsened and she developed sepsis, a dangerous medical condition in which the body responds improperly to an infection. She stabilized long enough to deliver a stillborn girl, whom she named Willow. Zurawski then spent days in intensive care.</p><p>She recently returned from a family trip to Disney World and said, \"I thought I'd be coming home from that trip with a 1-year-old and be putting her down for a nap.\u201d</p><p>\"But instead I'm doing this interview to help campaign for Biden,\" Zurawski said. \"It's just the complete opposite world than I ever would have seen myself in.\u201d</p>",
