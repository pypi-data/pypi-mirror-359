It said God created man and woman as biologically different, separate beings, and said people must not tinker with that plan or try to \"make oneself God.\u201d",

    "body_nitf": "<p>VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 The Vatican on Monday declared gender-affirming surgery and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/vatican-surrogacy-ivf-a9229ef32f3c5b4f3b0bb7bd0e08f503\">surrogacy as grave violations of human dignity</a>, putting them on par with abortion and euthanasia as practices that it said reject God\u2019s plan for human life.</p><p>The Vatican\u2019s doctrine office issued \u201cInfinite Dignity,\u201d a 20-page declaration that has been in the works for five years. After substantial revision in recent months, it was approved March 25 by Pope Francis, who ordered its publication.</p><p>From a pope who has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/vatican-lgbtq-pope-bfa5b71fa79055626e362936e739d1d8\">made outreach to the LGBTQ+ community</a> a hallmark of his papacy, the document was received as a setback, albeit predictable, by trans Catholics. But its message was also consistent with the Argentine Jesuit's long-standing belief that while trans people should be welcomed in the church, so-called \u201cgender ideologies\u201d should not.</p><p>In its most eagerly anticipated section, the Vatican repeated its rejection of \u201cgender theory,\u201d or the idea that one\u2019s biological sex can change. It said God created man and woman as biologically different, separate beings, and said people must not tinker with that or try to \"make oneself God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt follows that any sex-change intervention, as a rule, risks threatening the unique dignity the person has received from the moment of conception,\u201d the document said.</p><p>It distinguished between gender-affirming surgeries, which it rejected, and \u201cgenital abnormalities\u201d that are present at birth or that develop later. Those abnormalities can be \u201cresolved\u201d with the help of health care professionals, it said.</p><p>Advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics immediately criticized the document as outdated, harmful and contrary to the stated goal of recognizing the \u201cinfinite dignity\u201d of all of God's children. They warned it could have real-world effects on trans people, fueling anti-trans violence and discrimination.</p><p>\u201cWhile it lays out a wonderful rationale for why each human being, regardless of condition in life, must be respected, honored, and loved, it does not apply this principle to gender-diverse people,\u201d said Francis DeBernardo of New Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics.</p><p>Nicolete Burbach, lead expert in social and environmental justice at the London Jesuit Centre, said the document showed the Vatican continues to fail to engage with queer and feminist approaches to the body \u201cwhich it simply dismisses as supposedly subjecting both the body and human dignity itself to human whims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the main difficulty faced by the document is that it attempts to affirm the church\u2019s authentic commitment to human dignity in the face of a troubling history on the part of the church itself around attacks on that dignity,\u201d said Burbach, a trans Catholic theologian who researches transness and the Catholic Church.</p><p>The document\u2019s existence, rumored since 2019, was confirmed in recent weeks by the new prefect of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, Argentine Cardinal V\u00edctor Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez, a close Francis confidant.</p><p>Fern\u00e1ndez had cast the document as something of a nod to conservatives after he authored a more explosive document <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/vatican-lgbtq-pope-bfa5b71fa79055626e362936e739d1d8\">approving blessings for same-sex couples</a> that sparked criticism from conservative bishops around the world, especially in Africa.</p><p>And yet, in an apparent attempt at balance, the document takes pointed aim at countries \u2014 including many in Africa \u2014 that criminalize homosexuality. It echoed Francis' assertion in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pope-francis-gay-rights-ap-interview-1359756ae22f27f87c1d4d6b9c8ce212\">\u201cbeing homosexual is not a crime</a>.\"</p><p>The new document denounces \u201cas contrary to human dignity the fact that, in some places, not a few people are imprisoned, tortured, and even deprived of the good of life solely because of their sexual orientation.\u201d</p><p>The White House said President Joe Biden, a devout Catholic, was \u201cpleased\u201d to see that the declaration \u201cfurthers the Vatican\u2019s call to ensure that LGBTQ+ (individuals) are protected from violence and imprisonment around the world,\u201d press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.</p><p>On the specifics involving gender theory, Jean-Pierre stressed that it was not Biden\u2019s role to \u201clitigate internal church policy.\u201d</p><p>Asked how its negative take on trans people squared with Francis\u2019 message of welcome, Fern\u00e1ndez said the welcome remained but that the pope fervently believed that the idea that gender was fluid \u201crather than helping to recognize dignity, impoverishes the vision\u201d of a man and woman coming together to create new life.</p><p>The document is something of a repackaging of previously articulated Vatican positions, read now through the prism of human dignity. It restates well-known Catholic doctrine opposing abortion and euthanasia, and adds to the list some of Francis\u2019 main concerns as pope: the threats to human dignity posed by poverty, war, human trafficking, the death penalty and forced migration.</p><p>In a newly articulated position, it says <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/vatican-surrogacy-ivf-a9229ef32f3c5b4f3b0bb7bd0e08f503\">surrogacy violates both the dignity of the surrogate mother and the child</a>.</p><p>While much attention about surrogacy has focused on possible exploitation of poor women as surrogates, the Vatican asserts that the child \"has the right to have a fully human (and not artificially induced) origin and to receive the gift of a life that manifests both the dignity of the giver and that of the receiver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering this, the legitimate desire to have a child cannot be transformed into a \u2018right to a child\u2019 that fails to respect the dignity of that child as the recipient of the gift of life,\u201d it said.</p><p>The Vatican had previously published its most articulated position on gender in 2019, when the Congregation for Catholic Education <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cb94b41d1d8046ddbde697dbba5022fc\">rejected the idea that people can choose</a> or change their genders and insisted on the complementarity of biologically male and female sex organs to create new life.</p><p>The new document from the more authoritative Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith quotes from that 2019 education document, but tempers the tone. Significantly, it doesn\u2019t repeat Vatican doctrine that homosexual people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect but that homosexual actions are \u201cintrinsically disordered.\u201d</p><p>In a news conference to introduce the document, Fern\u00e1ndez acknowledged that the \u201cintrinsically disordered\u201d language was very strong. He suggested there might be a better way, \"with other words,\" to express the church's vision of sex between husband and wife to create new life.</p><p>Francis has ministered to trans Catholics, including trans sex workers, and insisted that the Catholic Church must welcome all children of God.</p><p>But he has also denounced \u201cgender theory\u201d as the \u201cworst danger\u201d facing humanity today, an \u201cugly ideology\u201d that threatens to cancel out God-given differences between man and woman. He has blasted in particular what he calls the \u201cideological colonization\u201d of the West in the developing world, where development aid is sometimes conditioned on adopting Western ideas about gender.</p><p>Transgender activists immediately called the document \u201churtful\u201d and devoid of the voices and experiences of real trans people, especially in the distinction it makes between gender-affirming surgeries and surgeries on intersex people.</p><p>\u201cThe suggestion that gender-affirming health care \u2014 which has saved the lives of so many wonderful trans people and enabled them to live in harmony with their bodies, their communities and (God) \u2014 might risk or diminish trans people's dignity is not only hurtful but dangerously ignorant,\u201d said Mara Klein, a nonbinary, transgender activist who has participated in Germany\u2019s church reform project.</p><p>Klein said the Vatican \u201chypocrisy\u201d was furthered by the document's approval of surgery on intersex people, \u201cwhich if performed without consent especially on minors often cause immense physical and psychological harm.\u201d</p><p>The document comes at a time of some backlash against transgender people, including in the United States where Republican-led state legislatures are considering a new round of bills <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-health-care-republican-legislatures-5d98832c0234de079263672c738e0631\">restricting medical care for transgender youths</a> \u2014 and in some cases, adults.</p><p>\u201cOn top of the rising hostility towards our communities, we are faced with a church that does not listen and refuses to see the beauty of creation that can be found in our biographies,\u201d Klein said in an email.</p><p>___</p><p>AP writer Darlene Superville contributed from Air Force One.</p>",

            "reason": "The document primarily focuses on the Vatican's stance on gender-affirming surgery, surrogacy, and gender theory, framing these issues within the context of human dignity and religious doctrine. While it does touch on health-related topics such as gender-affirming surgeries and the psychological and physical impacts of these procedures, the primary focus is on the religious and ethical implications rather than health itself. Therefore, it is somewhat relevant to health but not highly focused on it."
