State TV showed what they said was the vessel pulled up on a beach a day after the tragedy, though it wasn\u2019t immediately clear how it had been brought ashore.</p><p>Maritime authorities continued to search for additional survivors, Nauaito told the radio station, adding that \u201cit is not easy to say with precision how many remain missing.\u201d Government officials were heading to the accident site Monday to get more precise information, he said.</p><p>The Nampula provincial authority released a statement attributing the accident to the \u201cuse of a vessel unsuitable for transporting passengers and overcrowding,\u201d Radio Mozambique reported.</p><p>Noticias, one of the country's main and oldest newspapers, said the boat ordinarily was used as a fishing vessel and that residents of the town of Lunga were trying to flee what they believed was a flare-up in cases of cholera that the country has suffered in recent months.</p><p>They wanted to reach the Island of Mozambique and departed \u201cin a stampede\u201d using boats \u201cunsuitable for navigation,\" the newspaper reported. The boat capsized before it could reach the island.</p><p>Some people still managed to reach the island's shore but died there after not being able to get medical help on time, the newspaper said. The country\u2019s national public broadcaster, Television of Mozambique, said two bodies of children remained uncollected in a morgue.</p><p>Authorities in Mozambique and neighboring southern African countries have been trying to contain a deadly cholera outbreak that spread in recent months.</p><p>Mozambique, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, has recorded 32 deaths from about 15,000 cholera cases since late last year. Nampula is the worst affected province with over 5,000 cholera cases, including 12 deaths, according to government data.</p><p>Many areas of Mozambique are only accessible by boats, which are often overcrowded. The country has a poor road network and some areas are unreachable by land or air.</p>",
