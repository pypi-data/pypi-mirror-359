The state Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that Arizona can enforce its long-dormant law making abortion illegal in all cases except when a mother\u2019s life is at stake. Enforcement won't take effect for at least two weeks. The ruling examined an 1864 law that predates Arizona\u2019s statehood. It provides no exceptions for rape or incest. The state\u2019s high court ruling reviewed a 2022 decision by the state Court of Appeals that said doctors couldn\u2019t be charged for performing the procedure in the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Arizona will soon join 14 other states that have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy after a state Supreme Court ruling Tuesday found that officials may enforce an 1864 law criminalizing all abortions except when a woman's life is at stake.</p><p>The court said enforcement won't begin for at least two weeks. However, it could be up to two months, based on an agreement reached in a related case in Arizona, according to state Attorney General Kris Mayes and Planned Parenthood, the plaintiffs in the current case.</p><p>The law provides no exceptions for rape or incest.</p><p>Under a near-total ban, the number of abortions in the state is expected to drop from about 1,100 monthly \u2014 as estimated by a survey for the Society of Family Planning \u2014 to almost zero. The forecast is based on what has happened in other states that ban abortion at all stages of pregnancy.</p><p>Arizona Sen. Eva Burch, who has had an abortion since <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/arizona-senator-senate-abortion-eva-burch-280e95049fa230e83c6edb3724b244a7\">announcing on the Senate floor last month</a> that she was seeking one because her pregnancy wasn\u2019t viable, criticized GOP lawmakers who back the ban.</p><p>\u201cThe fight for reproductive rights is not over in Arizona,\u201d she said, referring to a statewide petition campaign to put the issue on the ballot this fall. \u201cThis moment must not slow us down.\u201d</p><p>According to AP VoteCast, 6 out of 10 Arizona voters in the 2022 midterm elections said they would favor guaranteeing access to legal abortion nationwide.</p><p>Planned Parenthood officials vowed to continue providing abortions for the short time they are still legal and said they will reinforce networks that help women travel out of state to places like New Mexico and California to access abortion.</p><p>\u201cEven with today\u2019s ruling, Planned Parenthood Arizona will continue to provide abortion through 15 weeks for a very short period of time,\u201d said Angela Florez, president of the organization's Arizona chapter.</p><p>Arizona State University student Katarina White welcomed the ruling.</p><p>\u201cI was overcome by joy and happy to know that all these babies that could potentially be aborted aren\u2019t going to be aborted,\u201d the Tempe resident said. \u201cIt just made me really proud to be an Arizonan.\u201d</p><p>Brittany Crawford, a mother of three who owns a hair salon in Phoenix, said the high court's ruling could have far-reaching consequences.</p><p>\u201cYou are going to have a lot of desperate girls doing whatever they can to get rid of their babies,\" Crawford said. \"Some could end up dead.\u201d</p><p>She herself had an abortion at 18, right out of high school, and said she suffered extreme emotional trauma.</p><p>\u201cI still think I should have the right to decide whether I do have a child, or whether I don\u2019t have a child,\u201d she said.</p><p>The Center for Arizona Policy, a longtime backer of anti-abortion proposals before the Legislature, said the state\u2019s highest court reached the appropriate conclusion.</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s outcome acknowledges the sanctity of all human life and spares women the physical and emotional harms of abortion,\u201d the group said in a statement.</p><p>Nearly every state ban on abortions has been challenged with a lawsuit. Courts have blocked enforcing some restrictions, including prohibitions throughout pregnancy in Utah and Wyoming.</p><p>The Arizona ruling suggests doctors can be prosecuted for performing the procedure, and the 1864 law carries a sentence of two to five years in prison for doctors or anyone else who assists in an abortion.</p><p>\u201cIn light of this Opinion, physicians are now on notice that all abortions, except those necessary to save a woman\u2019s life, are illegal,\u201d the Arizona Supreme Court said in its decision, adding that additional criminal and regulatory sanctions may apply to abortions performed after 15 weeks.</p><p>Jill Gibson, chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood Arizona, said that means legal considerations are now likely to weigh heavily on any decision about abortion.</p><p>\u201cIt just creates this environment that makes it really impossible for a physician to understand her risk in taking care of her patients,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cRather than, you know, making clinical decisions based on what my patients are telling me, I will be phoning my lawyers for guidance on what I can do.\u201d</p><p>Planned Parenthood said it will continue to offer abortion services up to 15 weeks for at least two more months, in line with an agreement in the related case not to immediately enforce a near-total ban if upheld by the Arizona Supreme Court.</p><p>Since the U.S. Supreme Court <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-politics-health-5101ede97957cbf5f4f8aac1d5e5b4fa\">overturned Roe v. Wade</a> in 2022, most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions, and most Democratic-dominated ones have sought to protect abortion access.</p><p>Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, persuaded a state judge in Tucson to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-us-supreme-court-health-arizona-legislature-8120658e7f965855fba3f23b950321f0\">lift a restriction on enforcing the state's 1864 law</a>. Mayes, Brnovich\u2019s Democratic successor, had urged the state\u2019s high court to hold the line against it.</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s decision to reimpose a law from a time when Arizona wasn\u2019t a state, the Civil War was raging, and women couldn\u2019t even vote will go down in history as a stain on our state,\u201d Mayes said Tuesday.</p><p>Former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican who signed the state's current law restricting abortion after 15 weeks, posted on the social platform X saying that the state Supreme Court's ruling was not the outcome he would have wanted.</p><p>\u201cI signed the 15-week law as governor because it is thoughtful policy, and an approach to this very sensitive issue that Arizonans can actually agree on,\u201d he said.</p><p>___</p><p>This story corrects the day of the week that the Arizona Supreme Court issued its decision. It was Tuesday, not Thursday. ___</p><p>Associated Press writers Morgan Lee in Santa Fe, New Mexico; Jonathan J.
