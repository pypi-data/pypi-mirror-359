The Kenyatta Referral Hospital management said Tuesday that new doctors had been hired in place of those striking. Doctors in Kenya have been on a nationwide strike since March demanding better pay and working conditions. President William Ruto on Sunday broke his silence over the strike saying there was no money to pay striking doctors. \u201cWe must be honest with ourselves and the truth is that we must live within our means, we can\u2019t borrow money to pay salaries\u201d, Ruto said.",
