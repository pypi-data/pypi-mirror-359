The Maine House voted 76-68 Tuesday in favor of the proposal, but that didn't reach the necessary threshold to send it to voters for ratification. The same thing happened last week in the Senate. Each chamber will get one more vote. Republicans called the votes political theater, saying the outcome appeared to be a foregone conclusion. Democrats said the roll call votes in both chambers ensure that lawmakers' position on the issue will be on record.",
