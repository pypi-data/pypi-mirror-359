This year, the question could be put before voters in yet more states. It's a lock to be on the ballot in Colorado, Florida, Maryland and South Dakota. And it's a possibility in several other states, including Arizona and Nevada. The abortion rights measures would not all guarantee the same level of access, and some are so narrow that Planned Parenthood doesn't support putting them on the ballot.",

Wade was overturned.</p><p>The Colorado measure officially made the ballot Friday, and would enshrine abortion rights into the constitution in a state which already allows abortion at all stages of pregnancy.</p><p>Since that 2022 decision, most Republican-controlled states have new abortion restrictions in effect, including 14 that ban it at every stage of pregnancy. Most Democratic-led states have laws or executive orders to protect access.</p><p>Additionally, voters in seven states \u2014 California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, Ohio and Vermont \u2014 have sided with abortion rights supporters on ballot measures.</p><p>It's not clear yet how many states will vote on measures to enshrine abortion access in November. In some, the question is whether amendment supporters can get enough valid signatures. In others, it's up to the legislature. And there's legal wrangling in some states.</p><p>Some efforts that sought to restrict or ban abortion have also failed to reach ballots. In Wisconsin, the House approved a measure asking voters to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-abortion-14-weeks-pregnancy-bill-f7ebe31fc87f11a05127ed1e5b5ee155\">ban abortion after 14 weeks</a>, but the legislative session ended without a vote from the state Senate. Likewise, Iowa lawmakers ended their session without approving a measure asking voters to find that there's no constitutional right to abortion. Pennsylvania lawmakers previously pursued a similar amendment, but it\u2019s not expected to be added to the ballot this year. A <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/louisiana-abortion-ban-bill-ec7b7ec7f48aa382d69683d7f7e46944\">Louisiana measure</a> to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution died in committee, and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-maine-constitutional-amendment-fails-edc0b5f249eec560067233abc4044436\">one in Maine</a> effectively died when it fell short of receiving the approval of two-thirds of the House.</p><hl2>WHAT'S SECURELY ON 2024 BALLOTS?</hl2><p>FLORIDA</p><p>The state Supreme Court ruled on April 1 that a ballot measure to legalize abortion until viability could go on the ballot despite a legal challenge from state Attorney General Ashley Moody, who argued that there are differing views on the meaning of \u201cviability\u201d and that some key terms in the proposed measure are not properly defined.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/florida-abortion-ballot-elections-931be34f9ffdd6d74f6beade05eeee47\">Advocates collected</a> nearly a million signatures to put a state constitutional amendment to legalize abortion until viability on the ballot, surpassing the nearly 892,000 required.</p><p>Sixty percent of voters would have to agree for it to take effect.</p><p>Abortion is currently illegal in Florida after the first six weeks of pregnancy <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/florida-abortion-ban-9509a806453e1eab50d118aaecffa2f1#:~:text=(AP)%20%E2%80%94%20Florida's%20ban%20on,access%20to%20needed%20health%20care.\">under a law</a> that took effect on May 1.</p><p>MARYLAND</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-maryland-constitutional-amendment-66a9c900d1b553e836e4b94cd3f32ae4\">Maryland voters</a> also will be asked this year to enshrine the right to abortion in the state\u2019s constitution. The state already protects the right to abortion under state law and Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1. Abortion is allowed in Maryland until viability.</p><p>SOUTH DAKOTA</p><p>South Dakota voters will <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-south-dakota-voter-ballot-amendment-ed7f558d0cfeabd944cef6ba4aa33cdc\">decide this fall</a> on a measure that would ban any restrictions on abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. It would allow the state in the second trimester to \u201cregulate the pregnant woman\u2019s abortion decision and its effectuation only in ways that are reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman.\u201d An abortion ban would be allowed in the third trimester, as long as it included exceptions for the life and health of the woman.</p><p>The state\u2019s top election official announced Thursday that about 85% of the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-dakota-abortion-rights-ballot-initiative-1add60de74f1985a19d01084d796297d\">more than 55,000 signatures submitted</a> in support of the ballot initiative are valid, exceeding the required 35,017 signatures.</p><p>Opponents still have until June 17 to file a challenge with the secretary of state\u2019s office.</p><p>COLORADO</p><p>Colorado's top election official confirmed Friday that a measure to enshrine abortion protections into the state constitution, including requirements that Medicaid and private health insurers cover it, made the ballot for the fall election.</p><p>Supporters said they gathered over 225,000 signatures, nearly the double the requirement of over 124,000 signatures.</p><p>Amending the state constitution requires the support of 55% of voters.</p><p>Those backing a dueling measure \u2014 a law to ban abortion \u2014 did not turn in signatures, and the measure will not go before voters.</p><p>Abortion is legal at all stages of pregnancy in Colorado.</p><hl2>WHERE ELSE COULD ABORTION BE ON THE BALLOT IN 2024?</hl2><p>ARIZONA</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-arizona-ballot-voters-2024-a7ea711840cbe2103a9c75c4c4dd4ef3\">A signature drive is underway</a> to add a constitutional right to abortion in Arizona. Under the measure, the state would not be able to ban abortion until the fetus is viable, with later abortions allowed to protect a woman's physical or mental health. Supporters must gather nearly 384,000 valid signatures by July 4.</p><p>Abortion is currently legal for the first 15 weeks of pregnancy in Arizona. An Arizona Supreme Court ruling in April said enforcement could begin soon for a near-total ban that was already on the books. The governor has since signed a bill <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/arizona-abortion-1864-ban-repeal-24578e546b69ca087e01034bcaf4aa01\">repealing that law</a>. It is still expected to be in effect for a time, however.</p><p>ARKANSAS</p><p>Proponents of an amendment to allow abortion in many cases must gather nearly 91,000 signatures by July 5 for it to get it on the Nov. 5 ballot. The measure would bar laws banning abortion in the first 20 weeks of gestation and allow abortion later in pregnancy in cases of rape, incest, threats to the woman's health or life, or if the fetus would be unlikely to survive birth. Because it allows abortion to be banned 20 weeks into pregnancy, the proposal does not have the support of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which includes Arkansas. The state currently bans abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with narrow exceptions.</p><p>MISSOURI</p><p>Missouri abortion rights advocates turned in more than 380,000 signatures \u2014 more than twice the required 171,000 \u2014 for a measure asking voters to approve a constitutional amendment to guarantee abortion until viability.</p><p>A group of moderate Republicans have for this year abandoned efforts for <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-missouri-constitutional-amendment-viability-37e28b7609607ae762626206ea1a72c1\">an alternate amendment</a> that would have allowed abortion up to 12 weeks, with limited exceptions after that.</p><p>Abortion is currently banned in Missouri at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions.</p><p>MONTANA</p><p>Abortion rights proponents in Montana have proposed a constitutional amendment that would bar the government from denying the right to abortion before viability or when it\u2019s necessary to protect the life or health of the pregnant person. After a legal battle over the ballot language, the Montana Supreme Court on April 1 wrote its version of the language that would appear on the ballot if supporters gather more than 60,000 signatures by June 21. Abortion is legal until viability in Montana, under a 1999 Montana Supreme Court opinion.</p><p>NEBRASKA</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ballot-measure-nebraska-0ccae759148162706ab1e2006ecb936e\">Advocates are trying to collect</a> about 125,000 signatures needed by July 5 to put a constitutional amendment before voters to protect abortion rights until fetal viability. A competing petition effort would add a constitutional amendment mirroring a law adopted last year that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-transgender-ban-nebraska-filibuster-b0b88845d29f1aaadf7936b7304a0507\">bans abortion after 12 weeks</a>, with some exceptions.</p><p>NEVADA</p><p>Signatures are being gathered to place an abortion access amendment on <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nevada-abortion-access-ballot-471e9036864c030cc5296e7c78da8dad\">Nevada's ballot</a> in November. Under the amendment, abortion access for the first 24 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 or later to protect the health of the pregnant person \u2014 would be enshrined in the state constitution. Such access is already assured under a law passed in 1990. More than 102,000 valid signatures are required by June 26 to place the measure on the ballot. To change the constitution, voters would need to approve it in both 2024 and 2026.</p><p>The measure is one of several attempts by Nevada abortion rights groups to get a ballot question before voters in 2024 or 2026.</p><p>NEW YORK</p><p>Earlier this month, a judge removed an equal protection amendment involving reproductive health care from the November ballot, finding <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-new-york-amendment-election-2024-4d3815708ef78c11599e1ebbb35ef896\">lawmakers missed a procedural step</a> when they put it there.</p><p>Attorney General Letitia James said she would appeal the ruling.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-us-supreme-court-politics-womens-rights-new-york-5ae2968ab80098246978af10765ed9ae\">measure would bar discrimination</a> based on \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d and \u201creproductive healthcare,\" along with sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin and disability. The language does not explicitly preserve a right to abortion in New York, where it's currently allowed until viability.</p>",
