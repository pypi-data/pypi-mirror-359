    "description_summary": "A judge in Wisconsin is hearing testimony to help determine whether a woman should be released from a psychiatric center, a decade after she nearly killed a girl at age 12. Two psychologists say Morgan Geyser isn't ready yet. Geyser is now 21 years old. She told authorities that she repeatedly stabbed a classmate to please the online horror character Slender Man in 2014. The victim survived. An accomplice was released from Winnebago Mental Health Institute in 2021. Psychologist Brooke Lundbohm told the judge that Geyser now denies ever having psychotic symptoms. Lundbohm says that \u201cdoesn't line up\u201d with her care.",

But one psychologist said the case has taken an unusual turn because Geyser claims she had been faking psychotic symptoms, which \u201cdoesn't line up\u201d with years of observation and treatment.</p><p>\u201cThat would be rather remarkable. That would be very callous as well,\u201d said Brooke Lundbohm, who has seen Geyser since 2014.</p><p>\u201cIf the person is not able to have insight into their mental health condition, the potential warning signs, the triggers that could cause decline, have insight into the kinds of treatment that may be beneficial \u2014 it raises a lot of concerns\u201d about being discharged, Lundbohm testified.</p><p>Waukesha County Judge Michael Bohren is hearing from experts to determine whether to grant the release. The hearing will resume Thursday with cross-examination by Geyser's attorney.</p><p>Geyser and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/a90fb1fd89fcc38a9a05d33df0e713e0\">Anissa Weier</a> were 12 in 2014 when they lured Payton Leutner to a Waukesha park after a sleepover. Geyser stabbed Leutner repeatedly while Weier egged her on. Leutner suffered 19 stab wounds and barely survived, authorities said.</p><p>Geyser pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree intentional homicide and was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/4a769047be4d45db8271506cb162df73\">sent to the psychiatric institute because of mental illness.</a></p><p>Another psychologist, Deborah Collins, said Geyser has made \u201cbona fide progress\u201d but agreed that she could pose a risk to the public. Collins said release could be appropriate in six to 12 months.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s future-oriented. She\u2019s goal-oriented as well,\u201d Collins said.</p><p>Collins said she has seen Geyser approximately a dozen times since her arrest a decade ago. She was diagnosed at the time with schizophrenia spectrum disorder.</p><p>\u201cAppraising her readiness for conditional release is a challenging call,\u201d Collins said. \u201cMiss Geyser is now approaching 22 years of age, and she\u2019s spent virtually all of her adolescence and much of her adulthood in an institution. ... All we know is how Miss Geyser functioned prior to the age of 12 in the context of what appears to have been certainly a dysfunctional but also an abusive childhood.\u201d</p><p>Weier pleaded guilty to attempted second-degree intentional homicide and was also sent to the psychiatric center. She <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-0604d05ccb11f062cf6228568fafc435\">was granted a release</a> in 2021 to live with her father and was ordered to wear a GPS monitor.</p>",
