April 9, 2024.</p><p>Editorial: Lawmakers can, and should, address Louisiana\u2019s maternal and infant mortality crisis</p><p>Of all the \u201cbad\u201d rankings on which Louisiana leads the nation, none are more heartbreaking \u2014 or damning \u2014 than those reflecting the risks associated with childbirth.</p><p>Here\u2019s one such measure: In the decade prior to the pandemic, babies in Louisiana were 65% more likely to <a href=\"https://www.nola.com/tncms/asset/editorial/47418d1a-6467-11ee-a2ff-736ae014c706/\">die from preterm birth and low birth weight</a> than those in the rest of the country, according to an analysis of Centers of Disease Control and Prevention data by The Times-Picayune ' The Advocate.</p><p>Here\u2019s a related one: Louisiana had the fifth-highest <a href=\"https://www.nola.com/tncms/asset/editorial/0b1914b2-3dec-11ee-b8c4-477345007335/\">maternal death rate</a> among all states from 2018 to 2021, according to the health care research outlet KFF.</p><p>Many factors contribute to the crisis, including preexisting health issues affecting women who get pregnant and the difficulty navigating care for Louisiana moms whose pregnancies are covered by Medicaid.</p><p>So we\u2019re glad to see that, this session, the Legislature is considering a number of bills aimed at making childbearing less dangerous.</p><p>We urge lawmakers to act on behalf of the moms and kids who desperately need better outcomes. Among the bills filed:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=24RS&b=SB135&sbi=y\">Senate Bill 135</a> by Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, would allow more women whose pregnancies are covered by Medicaid to keep their coverage for a year beyond childbirth. Advocates note that a majority of Louisiana\u2019s pregnancy-associated deaths happen in the 12 months following delivery. The bill would give this benefit to an additional 8,000 women each year whose incomes are currently above the cutoff.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=24RS&b=HB860&sbi=y\">House Bill 860</a> by Rep. Michael Echols, R-Monroe, would require newborn nurse home visits to be covered by Medicaid. This would expand a pilot program now underway in New Orleans that\u2019s been linked to fewer emergency room visits, lower rates of child protective services investigations and reduced reports of postpartum depression and anxiety.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=24RS&b=SB190&sbi=y\">Senate Bill 190</a> by Sen. Gerald Boudreaux, D-Lafayette, would increase Medicaid reimbursement for services that impact maternal health outcomes.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=24RS&b=HB489&sbi=y\">House Bill 489</a> by Rep. Jason Hughes, D-New Orleans, along with <a href=\"https://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=24RS&b=SB300&sbi=y\">Senate Bill 300</a> by Duplessis, would mandate that postpartum services such as lactation and dietary consulting be covered.</p><p>And <a href=\"https://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=24RS&b=HB702&sbi=y\">House Bill 702</a> by Rep. Matthew Willard, D-New Orleans, and <a href=\"https://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=24RS&b=SB142&sbi=y\">Senate Bill 142</a> by Sen. Regina Barrow, D-Baton Rouge, aim to standardize coverage of doula services.</p><p>These proposals are among those supported by a broad coalition that includes the March of Dimes, the Louisiana Public Health Institute, the Louisiana Partnership for Children & Families, the New Orleans Health Department and other organizations.</p><p>We\u2019re encouraged that several of these bills have made it through the initial committee process with little pushback, and hope that lawmakers unite to prioritize this vital cause.</p><p>As New Orleans Health Director Dr. Jennifer Avegno pointed out, the bad outcomes happen in all corners of our state, from the big cities to the rural areas.</p><p>\u201cWe have a state that\u2019s more than 60% Medicaid births,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s everybody\u2019s constituents.\u201d</p><p>More than that. It\u2019s all of our children.</p><p>END</p>",
