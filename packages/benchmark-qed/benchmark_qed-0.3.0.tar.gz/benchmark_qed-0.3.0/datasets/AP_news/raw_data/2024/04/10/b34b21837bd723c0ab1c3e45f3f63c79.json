The Arizona Supreme Court said this week officials may enforce an 1864 law criminalizing abortion except when a woman\u2019s life is at stake. The Guttmacher Institute says interstate travel for abortions more than doubled between 2020 and 2023. Organizations that help fund abortions say traveling could lead to appointments later in a pregnancy and could be a financial burden. Arizona is home to more than 20 federally recognized tribes, and there's already a decades-old ban on most abortions at clinics and hospitals run by the federal Indian Health Service.",

Mansanares said the clinics should be able to accommodate people who are seeking the procedure in the wake of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/arizona-abortion-ban-what-to-know-797a4bbbc738497fe2284d6870c5be24\">an Arizona Supreme Court decision</a>.</p><p>\u201cThat is still a very long way for patients to go for health care,\" she added, noting that the clinics already have seen nearly 700 patients from Arizona since Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022.</p><p>Doctors and clinic leaders said there'll be a scramble across the Southwest and West for abortion care due to Tuesday's decision, which said officials may enforce an 1864 law criminalizing all abortions except when a woman\u2019s life is at stake.</p><p>\u201cPeople are going to have to start looking out of state,\u201d said Dr. Maria Phillis, an Ohio OB-GYN who also has a law degree. \u201cThis is now another place where they can\u2019t go safety to access care.\u201d</p><p>On top of potentially long distances to states like New Mexico, California and Colorado, patients who used to go to Arizona from other states for abortion care will have to go elsewhere, Phillis said.</p><p>Plus, Arizona is home to more than 20 federally recognized tribes, and barriers are expected to be higher for <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-us-supreme-court-oklahoma-sd-state-wire-south-dakota-24541ed0e66b5e1e1cd8b84e7e2e3159\">Native Americans</a> because of existing hurdles, such as a decades-old ban on most abortions at clinics and hospitals run by the federal Indian Health Service and fewer nearby health centers offering abortions.</p><p>Interstate travel for abortions nearly doubled between 2020 and 2023, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. Out-of-state patients accounted for 16% of abortions obtained nationally, compared to 9% in 2020, the group said.</p><p>Guttmacher data scientist Isaac Maddow-Zimet said that when bans go into effect, more people travel to less restrictive or non-restrictive states, but \"not everybody is able to\u201d travel.</p><p>Traveling could mean pushing abortions <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-care-wait-times-us-roe-dobbs-7b0a328bb34b0acb3d37e359a63712fc\">later into pregnancy</a> as people try to get appointments and potentially face mandatory waiting periods. According to results of a periodic survey spearheaded by Middlebury College economics professor Caitlin Myers, waits in several states stretched for two or three weeks at various points since federal abortion protections were overturned; some clinics had no available appointments.</p><p>The Brigid Alliance works nationally to help people who need abortions receive financial and logistical support like airfare, child care, lodging and other associated costs. Last year, it helped 26 people travel out of Arizona to get abortions.</p><p>Interim executive director Serra Sippel expects the number of calls from Arizona residents to grow.</p><p>People that the alliance has helped go out of state \u2014 mostly from Georgia, Texas and Florida \u2014 have seen backlogs stretching to four to five weeks because of higher demand, Sippel said. Some get bounced between clinics because their pregnancy has passed the point that they can get care there.</p><p>\u201cWith a pregnancy, every moment counts,\u201d said Sippel, who added that delays can have serious repercussions. Phillis noted procedures done later in a pregnancy could take longer and be slightly more complicated.</p><p>The Abortion Fund of Arizona, which helps people travel for abortions both in and out of state, said out-of-state clinics have required patients to stay to take the second pill used in medication abortions because of concerns about liability. That means multi-day trips, said Eloisa Lopez, executive director of Pro-Choice Arizona and the abortion fund.</p><p>\u201cWe're looking at anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000 per person for travel expenses, with their abortion procedure expense,\" Lopez said.</p><p>Lopez also said she has spoken with the governor's office about state funding for abortion-related travel expenses.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Tucson, a CEO of a pregnancy center that opposes abortion said things are likely to stay the same under the new law. Hands of Hope Tucson has been around for 43 years, is about 200 steps from a Planned Parenthood clinic and is pretty busy, CEO Joanie Hammond said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just coming alongside women and men who are facing an unexpected pregnancy \u2026 We\u2019ve always been about the women and about the babies,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cAt the pregnancy center, I see the women and I see what happens to them after they go through that abortion experience. We just want to be there to help them in the next step for healing and whatever they need.\u201d</p><p>For Arizona residents who are closer to California, which <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-california-legislature-gavin-newsom-29eabbab54050c6d25030c56cfc86aba\">expanded its abortion protections</a> after Roe v. Wade was overturned, officials are pointing people toward the Abortion Safe Haven Project. Created by the state and Los Angeles County, the project has guidance and resources for out-of-state patients.</p><p>Planned Parenthood of the Pacific Southwest put out a statement this week from president and CEO Darrah DiGiorgio Johnson, saying it supports out-of-state patients with navigation services to help them tackle logistical barriers to care.</p><p>___</p><p>This story was first published on April 10, 2024. It was updated on April 12, 2024, to correct to whom Pro-Choice Arizona spoke about funding. The organization talked to the governor\u2019s office, not municipalities, about state funding for abortion-related travel expenses.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
