Dr. Hilary Cass said there is \u201cno good evidence on the long-term outcomes of interventions to manage gender-related distress.\u201d She said young people have been caught up in a \u201cstormy social discourse\u201d about the issue. Cass was appointed to lead a review of gender services for young people by the state-funded National Health Service. In her report on Wednesday she said that care had been driven by \u201cideology\u201d rather sound medical principles. She called for a new and more holistic approach.",

The decision came after recommendations in Cass\u2019 earlier interim report, which said there is not enough evidence about the potential benefits and harms of the blockers, which help prevent people from developing physical features not in line with their gender identity, such as beards or breasts.</p><p>The decision \u2014 which is not an outright ban on puberty blockers \u2014 was criticized by some transgender campaigners and is being closely watched in the United States. Transgender medical care for minors is endorsed by major U.S. medical associations, but <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-pride-lgbtq-white-house-ddd40bb1a1110654b9d836e87507db51\">several Republican-led states</a> have banned puberty blockers and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-health-care-republican-legislatures-5d98832c0234de079263672c738e0631\">other treatment</a> for transgender youth \u2014 and, in some cases, adults.</p><p>Cass\u2019 report, which runs to almost 400 pages, said that \u201cfor most young people, a medical pathway\u201d is not the best way to deal with gender-related issues.</p><p>Cass said young people questioning their gender identity should be given \u201ca holistic assessment\u201d including screening for neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism, and a mental health assessment.</p><p>She urged \u201cextreme caution\u201d about giving children or teens masculizing or feminizing hormones \u2014 testosterone or estrogen \u2014 to people under 18.</p><p>Prime Minister <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/rishi-sunak\">Rishi Sunak</a> welcomed the review\u2019s recommendation of caution.</p><p>\u201cWe simply do not know the long-term impacts of medical treatment or social transitioning on them, and we should therefore exercise extreme caution,\u201d he said.</p><p>Critics accuse Sunak\u2019s Conservative government of weaponizing the issue of gender identity as part of a \u201cculture war\u201d electoral strategy. The government recently issued guidelines for schools that said teachers should not be required to address children by their preferred pronouns.</p><p>In her report, Cass said there was \u201cno clear evidence\u201d that social transition in childhood \u2014 such as changing names or pronouns \u2014 has any positive or negative mental health outcomes.</p><p>The report also concluded that there is no simple explanation for why the number of young people identifying as transgender has shot up in recent years in the U.K. and other countries.</p><p>\u201cThere is broad agreement that it is a result of a complex interplay between biological, psychological and social factors,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis balance of factors will be different in each individual.\u201d</p><p>The LGBTQ rights group Stonewall said many of the report\u2019s recommendations \u201ccould make a positive impact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut without due care, training or further capacity in the system, others could lead to new barriers that prevent children and young people from accessing the care they need and deserve,\" said the group\u2019s director of campaigns and human rights, Robbie de Santos.</p>",
