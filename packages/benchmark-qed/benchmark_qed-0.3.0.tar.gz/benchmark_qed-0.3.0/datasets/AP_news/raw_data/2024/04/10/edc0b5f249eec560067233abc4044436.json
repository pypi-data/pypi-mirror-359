The measure fell shy of a two-thirds majority in the Maine House on Tuesday night, failing to clear the hurdle for sending the amendment to voters for ratification. Both chambers have to approve the resolution, so it's effectively dead even though the Senate set the measure aside for review of costs on Wednesday. The final Maine House vote came hours after a court ruling set the stage for a near-total ban on abortions in Arizona.",

The Maine Senate delayed a final vote Wednesday by setting the measure aside, pending a review of what it would cost. But without House approval, it is effectively dead.</p><p>Maine already has one of the nation\u2019s least restrictive abortion laws. The amendment was an effort to head off any future legislative debate on the issue.</p><p>Republicans described the proposal as political theater because the outcome was a forgone conclusion. But the roll call ensures lawmakers' votes will be on record, which could have consequences in an election year, amendment supporters said.</p><p>\u201cLast night\u2019s vote was infuriating and shameful, but it will galvanize Mainers from all corners of the state,\" Lisa Margulies, from the Planned Parenthood Maine Action Fund, said Wednesday morning, chastising lawmakers for not letting voters have the final word at the ballot box. \u201cNow we know where every elected official in the House stands on reproductive rights.\u201d</p><p>The vote came after the Arizona Supreme Court gave the go-ahead to enforce a long-dormant law that bans nearly all abortions. The law, which predates Arizona\u2019s statehood, provides no exceptions for rape or incest and allows abortions only if the mother\u2019s life is in jeopardy.</p><p>Maine was one of more than a dozen states considering ballot measures dealing with abortion for this year or for 2026. Amendments are currently on the November ballot in Florida, Maryland and New York.</p><p>Abortion questions have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ballot-measure-2024-state-vote-e7d635835dc3a440789ad87787553ec1\">appeared on statewide ballots</a> seven times since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. In each case, the side backed by abortion-rights advocates prevailed \u2014 even in conservative states such as Kansas and Kentucky and swing states such as Michigan and Ohio.</p><p>Maine's Democratic-controlled Legislature last year approved a law that allows abortions at any time if deemed medically necessary by a doctor. Maine\u2019s previous law, adopted in 1993, made abortions legal until a fetus becomes viable outside the womb, at roughly 26 to 28 weeks.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press reporter Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, contributed to this report.</p>",

While the primary focus is on the political and legal aspects, the topic of abortion is inherently related to health, particularly reproductive health. The document also touches on the broader context of abortion laws in other states and the potential health implications of restrictive abortion laws. However, the primary focus is not on health per se, but rather on the legislative and political dimensions of abortion rights."
