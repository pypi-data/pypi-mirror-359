April 9, 2024.</p><p>Editorial: In April, be accepting, not aware, of autism</p><p>Most of our calendars list April as Autism Awareness Month, but many members of the autistic community are pushing for a name change.</p><p>We\u2019re typically asked to be aware of things that are dangerous or ailments in need of a cure or prevention \u2014 October\u2019s Domestic Violence Awareness Month or National Colon Cancer Awareness Month in March, for example.</p><p>Naming April an awareness month for autism sends the message that autism spectrum disorder is something to fear or avoid and that people living with autism can be made \u201cnormal\u201d with the right treatment.</p><p>In reality, autism is a lifelong neurological and developmental condition that can affect a person\u2019s social skills, communication, relationships and self-regulation. It\u2019s called a spectrum disorder because of the wide variation in the types and severity of symptoms people with autism experience.</p><p>Some \u2014 but not all \u2014 people with autism may have difficulty maintaining conversations or making eye contact in social settings. They may also have intense interest in specific topics and may be more sensitive to light and sound.</p><p>Autism is a disability, but, like other disabilities, that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s something \u201cwrong\u201d with those experiencing it.</p><p>No two human brains are the same. Our species enjoys neurodiversity. Everyone is good at some things and has trouble with other things.</p><p>The concept of a \u201cnormal\u201d brain is a myth, and ongoing research suggests that autism is more common than previously thought.</p><p>Last year, studies conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 1 out of every 36 children has autism. That figure is an increase from a 2021 estimate that put the rate at 1 in 44 and a huge leap from a 2006 report of 1 in 110.</p><p>It\u2019s easy to misinterpret those figures as an increase in the prevalence of cases, or an \u201cautism epidemic\u201d as some have wrongfully characterized it. Autism diagnoses are rising because medical professionals are getting better at recognizing it.</p><p>But the public\u2019s understanding of autism is lagging behind the medical field.</p><p>That\u2019s why organizations like the Autism Self Advocacy Network, a nonprofit run by and for autistic people, hope to turn the language away from awareness and toward acceptance.</p><p>While society as a whole tends to treat people with disabilities as a problem to be \u201cfixed,\u201d ASAN and others within the disability rights movement aim to change society, so that people with disabilities, including autism, have equal opportunities, resources and options for participation.</p><p>One way to help is to listen to people with autism, find out what they want and need. Researchers can help us gain understanding, but the best experts on an individualized conditions like autism are those who are experiencing it.</p><p>In this Autism Acceptance Month, take the time to talk to someone you know who has autism or a parent with a child with an autism diagnosis. Talk with them about their experiences \u2014 if they\u2019re willing. Learn about the things they struggle with and ask how you can help.</p><p>People with autism are people. We should accept that and treat them as such.</p><p>END</p>",
