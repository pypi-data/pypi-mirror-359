There were emotional recriminations Wednesday evening including one lawmaker asserting that a mass shooting and recent storms were God\u2019s revenge for \u201cimmoral\u201d laws adopted in Maine. The Democratic-led chamber advanced the legislation on an 80\u201470 vote in the House. On Thursday, the Maine House formally censured two lawmakers for their comments. The Senate gave approval Thursday but more votes are required.",

Michael Lemelin, R-Chelsea, said the mass shooting last October in Lewiston, Maine, that claimed 18 lives and recent storms were God\u2019s revenge for \u201cimmoral\u201d laws adopted by legislators, and he described the shield bill as \"inspired by Lucifer himself.\u201d Another lawmaker, Rep. Shelley Rudnicki, of Fairfield, announced that she agreed with Lemelin\u2019s remarks.</p><p>House Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross told Lemelin in a letter that the remarks were \u201cextremely offensive and intentionally harmful to the victims and the families of the Lewiston tragedy, the House of Representatives, and the people of Maine.\u201d</p><p>Lemelin and Rudnicki both delivered brief, identical apologies on the House floor, allowing them to resume their ability to speak and vote.</p><p>The Maine Senate voted 21-13 in favor of the bill Thursday, after a debate that was shorter than the tense discussion in the House ahead of a 80-70 vote in that chamber late Wednesday evening. More votes are required for enactment.</p><p>Several House Republicans focused on the underlying law that allows minors to receive abortions and gender-affirming care under certain circumstances. Critics said the bill could lead to kidnapping and trafficking of out-of-state teens.</p><p>But Democratic Rep. Sam Zager, D-Portland, said the standards of care laid out for medical providers require a robust process for whether someone has gender dysphoria and is eligible for gender-affirming care.</p><p>\u201cThis is not somebody whisked away for a weekend making a declaration and having surgery. It is very deliberate and very meticulous and is not done expediently,\u201d said Zager, who is a physician.</p><p>The sponsor of the bill suggested lawmakers were getting sidetracked by emotional topics of abortion and gender-affirming care instead of focusing on shielding Maine from out-of-state interference in its affairs. \u201cThis bill is about our state\u2019s sovereign ability to set and enforce our laws without interference from Texas, Tennessee or Kentucky,\u201d said Rep. Amy Kuhn, D-Falmouth.</p><p>Abortion is legal in Maine at all stages of pregnancy with a doctor\u2019s approval. And lawmakers last year approved a bill to let 16- and 17-year-olds receive limited gender-affirming care, which does not include surgery, without parental consent.</p>",

            "reason": "The document discusses a legislative debate in Maine over a proposed shield law to protect health care workers who provide abortion and gender-affirming care. While the primary focus is on the political and social implications of the bill, it does touch upon health-related topics such as abortion, gender-affirming care, and the standards of care for medical providers. However, the document is more centered on the political debate and censure rather than detailed health information or health care practices."
