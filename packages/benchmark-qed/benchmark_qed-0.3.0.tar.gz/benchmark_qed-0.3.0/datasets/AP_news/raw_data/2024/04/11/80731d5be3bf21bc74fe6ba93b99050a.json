    "description_summary": "Iowa has asked the state Supreme Court to let its blocked abortion law go into effect and uphold it altogether, disputing abortion providers\u2019 claims it infringes on women\u2019s rights to exercise bodily autonomy. The law that bans most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy was in effect for a few days in July, after Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed it but before a district court judge put it on pause as the courts assess its constitutionality. The ACLU of Iowa, Planned Parenthood North Central States and the Emma Goldman Clinic filed a legal challenge the day after it was passed. Abortion remains legal in Iowa up to 20 weeks of pregnancy while the new law is on hold. The state Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Thursday from lawyers for the state and for abortion providers in Iowa.",

A district court <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/iowa-six-weeks-abortion-ban-lawsuit-ad0bb52064d094b91f5efbc135ed4437\">judge soon after put it on pause</a> for the courts to assess its constitutionality. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds appealed the decision with the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/iowa-abortion-ban-lawsuit-appeal-5b7ebe1fccfcba7e2e30883be4f510fb\">state Supreme Court\u2019s permission</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/abortion\">Abortion</a> remains legal in Iowa up to 20 weeks of pregnancy while the new law is on hold.</p><p>Iowa lawmakers passed the measure with exclusively Republican support during a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/iowa-abortion-ban-special-session-506e5e3fcd5517024a94a8e3a52d627e\">one-day special session</a>. The ACLU of Iowa, Planned Parenthood North Central States and the Emma Goldman Clinic filed a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/iowa-abortion-ban-lawsuit-eeeec320fc6453e69075da5a118bf0c8\">legal challenge</a> the next day.</p><p>Most Republican-led states have limited abortion access following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/map-of-abortion-access-us\">14 states</a> have near total bans at all stages of pregnancy. Earlier this week, Arizona joined that set when <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/arizona-abortion-restrictions-1864-9c68866d69dca38c728dd27b80592e8f\">the state's Supreme Court upheld</a> a long-dormant law that bans nearly all abortions, with no exceptions for rape or incest.</p><p>Thursday\u2019s hearing in Iowa is the latest development in a yearslong legal battle over abortion restrictions in the state. The state Supreme Court would issue a decision by the end of its term in June, but that might not be the issue\u2019s conclusion.</p><p>Iowa\u2019s high court has not yet resolved whether earlier rulings that applied an \u201cundue burden test\u201d for abortion laws remain in effect. The undue burden is an intermediate level of scrutiny that requires laws do not create a significant obstacle to abortion.</p><p>\u201cIt is emphatically this court\u2019s role and duty to say how the Iowa Constitution protects individual rights, how it protects bodily autonomy, how it protects Iowan\u2019s rights to exercise dominion over their own bodies,\u201d Planned Parenthood attorney Peter Im told the justices.</p><p>The state argues the law should be analyzed using rational basis review, the lowest level of scrutiny to judge legal challenges. Representing the state, Eric Wessan said it\u2019s important \u201cafter years of litigation\u201d that Iowa\u2019s high court say that definitively in their decision.</p><p>The high court could decide to end the temporary pause without ruling on the law's constitutionality or the standard to use in assessing it, instead sending the case back to lower courts for full arguments there.</p><p>In July, Reynolds called lawmakers back to Des Moines after the Supreme Court <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/iowa-abortion-law-260563ff773b721c8a51ef6cb2c4e3b8\">declined to reinstate</a> a blocked 2018 law that was nearly identical to the new one. It was passed despite state and federal court decisions at the time, including the precedent set in Roe v. Wade, affirming a woman\u2019s constitutional right to abortion.</p><p>After both courts reversed those decisions, Reynolds asked for the 2018 law to go into effect. An Iowa high court justice\u2019s recusal led to a rare 3-3 decision that left the block intact.</p><p>The full court heard arguments on Thursday, suggesting all seven justices would consider the case.</p><p>Wessan referenced the Iowa Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 reversal in his arguments to show the bench already indicated what's appropriate in this case when they ruled there\u2019s no \u201cfundamental right\u201d to abortion in the state constitution.</p><p>\u201cThis court has never before recognized a quasi-fundamental or a fundamental-ish right,\u201d he said.</p><p>There are limited circumstances under the Iowa law that would allow for abortion after six weeks of pregnancy: rape, if reported to law enforcement or a health provider within 45 days; incest, if reported within 145 days; if the fetus has a fetal abnormality \u201cincompatible with life\u201d; or if the pregnancy is endangering the life of the woman. The state's medical board <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ban-iowa-d40f4875a9119387ec2053cc317803ff\">recently defined rules</a> for how doctors should adhere to the law.</p>",
