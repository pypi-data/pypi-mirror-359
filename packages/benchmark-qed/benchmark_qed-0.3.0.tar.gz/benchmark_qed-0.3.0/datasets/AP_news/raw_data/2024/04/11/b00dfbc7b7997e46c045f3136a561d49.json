High costs also are preventing many from getting on another plan. That's according to a survey of 1,227 adults by KFF. The health policy nonprofit also says more than 20 million people have lost federal health insurance coverage since the provision that stopped states from dropping people from Medicaid during the pandemic ended in March 2023. Fifty-six percent of people who were dropped said in the survey they put off needed medical care.",

That\u2019s more than the Biden administration\u2019s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/medicaid-eligibility-texas-florida-disenrollments-fe7c10276e86ab909060dd6fbea60328\">initial projection</a> of 15 million people.</p><p>States have through at least June \u2014 some longer \u2014 to finish eligibility reviews, so experts say the number is likely to grow. Medicaid enrollment <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/medicaid-eligibility-arkansas-pandemic-7f3e59825092a6f51f4a1fb2975b1f87\">nationally rose by nearly one-third during the pandemic</a>, from 71 million people in February 2020 to 94 million in April 2023.</p><p>The number of disenrollments and people without health insurance could be much higher, said Joan Alker, executive director and co-founder of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Children and Families. That\u2019s because the survey doesn\u2019t take into account children, who have been one of the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/medicaid-eligibility-children-computer-glitch-758dc1042375eda16d4973d521fe679f\">biggest groups affected</a> by unwinding.</p><p>\u201cThe question is, \u2018How long are they going to stay uninsured?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThe states who want to cover their citizens are going to have to do a lot of work to get them back.\u201d</p><p>Half of people who were enrolled in Medicaid prior to unwinding said they heard little or nothing at all about the process, according to the KFF survey, which includes responses from 1,227 adults who were previously covered by Medicaid.</p><p>Fifty-six percent of the people who were dropped said in the survey that they put off needed medical care while trying to renew.</p><p>And health care costs of any kind can be a major burden for low-income Americans, said Sara Rosenbaum of George Washington University\u2019s School of Public Health and Health Services.</p><p>\u201cSuddenly, a visit that didn\u2019t cost you anything (before) \u2013 let\u2019s say it\u2019s going to cost you $5. That $5 can be $500 for some folks,\u201d she said.</p><p>The majority of survey respondents also said they had problems when trying to renew their Medicaid coverage, like long wait times on the phone and issues with their paperwork. It\u2019s in line with concerns that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/medicaid-health-care-coverage-77d715bdb520316820d3cccbfda9cff7\">advocates and officials</a> had about the large number of procedural disenrollments \u2013 when people were dropped due to errors in paperwork or failing to return the forms.</p><p>In the 10 states that haven\u2019t yet expanded Medicaid, people were more likely to be required to provide proof of residency to renew their coverage, the KFF survey showed, with Black and Hispanic people overall more likely to be asked for proof.</p><p>That makes an already-complicated process even more arduous.</p><p>\u201cWe have known for decades that the more burdensome you make the application and renewal process,\u201d Rosenbaum said, \u201cthe greater likelihood that completely eligible people will not get the coverage they\u2019re entitled to get.\u201d</p><p>More than 30 million people are still awaiting Medicaid renewals, while 43.6 million have had their coverage renewed, according to KFF.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
