Before the bullying and the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/education-health-pandemics-teens-cd01cd672539d6a3dbada46bfa47203a\">suicide</a> attempts. Before she dropped out.</p><p>Before all that, Dusty Farr was \u2014 in his own words \u2014 \u201ca full-on bigot.\" By which he meant that he was eager to steer clear of anyone LGBTQ+.</p><p>Now, though, after everything, he says he wouldn\u2019t much care if his 16-year-old daughter \u2014 and he proudly calls her that \u2014 told him she was an alien. Because she is alive.</p><p>\u201cWhen it was my child, it just flipped a switch,\u201d says Farr, who is <a href=\"https://www.aclu-mo.org/sites/default/files/2023-07-31_-_petition.pdf\">suing</a> the Platte County School District on Kansas City's outskirts. \u201cAnd it was like a wake-up.\"</p><p>Farr has found himself in an unlikely role: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/arkansas-transgender-lgbtq-gender-affirming-care-lawsuits-15187bf53105ca3b9c4ab296efc1fcef\">fighting</a> bathroom bans that have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/lgbtq-rights-dont-say-gay-licenses-d0bf9d2f314ec6f28f2189795ea2d56c\">proliferated</a> at the state and local level in recent years. But Farr is not so unusual, says his attorney, Gillian Ruddy Wilcox of the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri.</p><p>\u201cIt sometimes takes meeting a person before someone can say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a person and that\u2019s who they are, and they\u2019re just being themselves,'\" she says. \u201cAnd I do think that for Dusty, that\u2019s what it took.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Looking back, Farr figures his daughter, the youngest of five, started feeling out of place in her own body when she was just 6 or 7. But he didn't see it.</p><p>Farr said he didn't have \u201ca lot of exposure to what I would consider the outside world\u201d in the conservative Nebraska community where he was raised. \u201cJust old farmers\u201d is how he described it.</p><p>Moving to the Kansas City area, which has 20% more people than live in all of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-bathrooms-sports-nebraska-01b7eeeb56874e2338e58d368765f66a\">Nebraska</a>, was a culture shock. \u201cI had never seen the LGBTQ community up close, and I would still have my closed-minded thoughts.\u201d He said things then that he now regrets. \u201cA lot of derogatory words. I don\u2019t want to go back to that place.\"</p><p>He settled on the outskirts in one of the more conservative enclaves, a community that is home to some of the troops stationed at nearby Fort Leavenworth. He worked as a service manager at a tractor repair facility.</p><p>His youngest \u2014 a smart, funny, loves-to-sing, light-up-a-room kind of kid \u2014 was his fishing and camping buddy. A competitive archer, she also joined her dad on trips to the shooting range.</p><p>\u201cNo parent has a favorite,\" Farr says, \u201cbut if I had a favorite, it would be my youngest.\u201d</p><p>But when she was 12, she started to steer away from him, spending more time with the rest of the family. It lasted for a few months before she came out to her family. He knows now how hard this was. \u201cGrowing up,\u201d he says, \u201cmy kids knew how I felt.\u201d</p><p>His wife, whom he described as less sheltered, was on board immediately. Him, not so much.</p><p>\u201cGiven the way I was raised, a conservative fire and brimstone Baptist, LGBTQ is a sin, you\u2019re going to hell. And these were things, unfortunately, that I said to my daughter,\u201d Farr says. \u201cI\u2019m kind of ashamed to say that.\u201d</p><p>They bumped heads and argued, their relationship strained. In desperation, he turned to God, poring through the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/religion-transgender-christianity-islam-hinduism-buddhism-judaism-804a93f0db2a6eeff84159665078e494\">Bible</a>, questioning teachings that he once took at face value that being transgender was an abomination. He prayed on it, too, replaying her childhood in his mind, seeing feminine qualities now that he had missed.</p><p>Then it hit him. \u201cShe\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got peace from God. Like, \u2018This is how your daughter was born. I don\u2019t make mistakes as God. So she was made this way. There\u2019s a reason for it.'\"</p><p>___</p><p>The switch was almost instantaneous. \u201cAn overnight epiphany,\" he calls it. \u201cIt\u2019s uplifting when you can actually accept the way things are, and you\u2019re not carrying that unfounded hate and unfounded disgust.\"</p><p>His daughter, who is named only by her initials of R.F. in the lawsuit, was stunned. He had been, she recalls, \u201cto say it nicely, very annoying.\u201d Now everything was different.</p><p>\u201cThere was this electricity in me that was just, it felt like pure joy. Just seeing someone I thought would never support me, just being one of my biggest supporters,\u201d she recalled as she played with her dog, a miniature Jack Russell terrier named Allie, at a park on an unseasonably warm February day. Her father was with her.</p><p>She, her father and her attorneys asked that she remain anonymous because she is unnamed in the lawsuit and to protect her from discrimination.</p><p>All those years, he had missed it. It is strange to him now.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was my inner bigotry not wanting to see it or if I was just blind. I don\u2019t know,\" he says.</p><p>But the how, the why \u2014 these are not things he likes to dwell on much.</p><p>\u201cWhere we\u2019re at now is what matters,\" he says. \"Me being a loving father. Me being accepting, me knowing that this isn\u2019t a choice. This is how she was born.\u201d</p><p>His daughter was diagnosed with gender dysphoria, or distress caused when gender identity doesn\u2019t match a person\u2019s assigned sex. A common treatment is to prescribe drugs to delay puberty.</p><p>That's what Farr's daughter did, along with growing out her hair. She had friends, and Farr says things returned to normal \u2014 for the most part.</p><p>But then came high school. \u201cAnd,\" Farr says, \"anything I did to her, school was 10 times worse.\u201d</p><p>The school knew about her gender dysphoria diagnosis, Farr says, describing it simply as a medical issue. Telling them about it was something he likened to talking about a case of chicken pox. The whole thing didn't seem like such a big deal now. \u201cWe were golden.\u201d After all, he says: \u201cIf we don\u2019t evolve, we die.\u201d</p><p>But the 2021-22 school year had just started when the assistant principal pulled his daughter aside. While remote learning persisted in some schools as the pandemic lingered, the high school was in person. According to the suit filed last year, the administrator said students must use the restroom of their sex designated at birth or a single gender-neutral bathroom. The district disputes that happened .</p><p>Another employee, the suit said, took it further and told her using the girls' bathroom was against the law. The district disputed that happened, too.</p><p>___</p><p>The thing is, there isn't a law \u2014 at least, not in Missouri.</p><p>While <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/utah-transgender-bathroom-access-746d51175ad770623e6f403b426fdc8c\">more than 10 states</a> have enacted laws over bathroom use, Missouri is not one of them. What Missouri has done is <a href=\"https://apnews.com/dfb348b44e4a11b18bda10c89744841a\">impose a ban</a> on gender-affirming care. For bathrooms, it leaves policy debate to local districts.</p><p>\u201cAsinine\" is how Farr described the whole wave of restrictions, while acknowledging in the same breath that he probably would have supported them a decade ago. \u201cKind of makes me dislike myself a little bit.\"</p><p>He figured it was all just a way to intimidate her. He thinks some people believe mistakenly that trans kids are trying to catch a glimpse of someone not fully clothed.</p><p>Some <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-rights-bathroom-law-kansas-b3d068afa2bc02bb15314ee04e8e3899\">Republican legislators</a> who have backed state-level bathroom laws have argued that they\u2019re responding to people\u2019s concerns about transgender women sharing bathrooms, locker rooms and other spaces with cisgender women and girls. But critics argue that restrictions cause harassment of transgender people, not the other way around.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they get the severity of what just telling someone what restroom they can use \u2014 what kind of impact something that small can have on someone.\"</p><p>His daughter didn\u2019t understand: \u201cIt kind of just made me feel hopeless in my education,\u201d she recalls thinking. \u201cBecause how is this place that\u2019s supposed to teach me everything to be an adult, how are they going to teach me what I need to learn when they\u2019re dictating where I pee?\u201d</p><p>The gender-neutral bathroom was far from her classes and often had long lines, the suit says. She, as a freshman, was missing class, and teachers were lecturing her. So she used the girls' restroom. Verbal reprimands were followed by a one day in-school suspension and then a two-day, out-of-school suspension, the suit says.</p><p>\u201cYour policy is dumb,\u201d Farr recalled telling the school, which argued in its response to his lawsuit that his daughter was eating lunch in the girls' restroom and had unclean hands.</p><p>His daughter started using the boys' restroom. The suit said it was because she feared more discipline, but the district argued in its written response that she was \u201cintentionally engaging in disruptive behavior in numerous bathrooms, perhaps to invite discipline.\u201d It didn't elaborate on what it meant by disruptive behavior.</p><p>One day, she was in the boys' restroom when a classmate approached and told another student, \u201cMaybe I should rape her,\u201d the suit said. Farr said the student told his daughter he was threatening her because she looked like a girl.</p><p>Beyond angry now, Farr called not just the school but the ACLU. The district acknowledged the incident, saying a student made a \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d comment about rape and was disciplined. By now, Farr's daughter was afraid to go to school.</p><p>\u201cIf I use the restroom they say I have to, I\u2019m going to get bullied. If I use the gender-neutral restroom, I\u2019m going to be late to my classes,\u201d Farr says, illustrating his daughter's point of view. \"So it\u2019s a damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t situation.\u201d</p><p>The district sees it differently, writing in a court filing that \u201cthere were numerous factors and circumstances in R.F.\u2019s life, unrelated to school, which may have caused emotional harm, depression and anxiety.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Ultimately, her parents got the school to agree to let her finish her freshman year online. But she missed three weeks of classes before the switch was approved. Typically an A and B student, she plummeted to D's and F's. Worse to Farr, his daughter was withdrawing, losing friends and isolating herself in her room.</p><p>He describes it as \u201ca dark rabbit hole of depression.\u201d Twice she tried to kill herself and was hospitalized. Everything from butter knives to headache medicine was locked up.</p><p>She returned in person to start her sophomore year, hoping things would be better. She made it only a few weeks before returning to online school.</p><p>At semester's end, Farr and his family moved out of the district. Bathroom access remained a source of friction in her new school, so again she switched to online school. When she turned 16 last spring, Farr and his wife agreed to let her drop out. He says they chose to focus on her mental health and describes it as \u201cprobably the best decision we've made.\u201d Still, it feels strange.</p><p>\"I never would have guessed that I would \u2014 I don\u2019t want to use happy \u2014 but would be OK with one of my kids quitting school,\" he said.</p><p>She is in counseling now, taking hormone replacement therapy, leaving her room and watching TV with Farr. She is interviewing for a job and considering an alternative high school completion program. She'd like to go to college one day, and study psychology, maybe law.</p><p>With the lawsuit filed, customers have approached Farr, telling him they support his fight. He was expecting they would scoff. Even his own parents are on board, which he says \u201csurprised the hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese aren\u2019t the people who raised me, let me tell you,\" he says.</p><p>Sometimes Farr's daughter yells at him, and he admits that he missed the teen attitude. That spirit and fight had faded.</p><p>\u201cBeing a teenager is hell,\" he says. \u201cBeing a trans teen is 10 kinds of hell. She\u2019s the brave one. I\u2019m just her voice.\u201d</p><p>He feels he has changed enough to fill this role \u2014 that being her voice can help other parents and kids avoid what his family endured. \u201cOur kids,\" he says, \u201care dying.\u201d He thinks that because of where he came from, maybe people will listen when he raises alarms. Maybe.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a transgender person,\u201d he says of his transformation. \u201cThere\u2019s the dead me. And then there\u2019s the new me.\u201d</p>",

While it touches on mental health issues such as depression and suicide attempts, the main narrative is about social acceptance, legal rights, and personal transformation rather than health in a broader or more general sense. Therefore, it is somewhat relevant to health but not highly focused on it."
