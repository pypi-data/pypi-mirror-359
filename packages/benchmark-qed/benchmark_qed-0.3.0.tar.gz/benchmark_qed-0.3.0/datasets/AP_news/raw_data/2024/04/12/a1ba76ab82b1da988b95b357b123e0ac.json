The order signed Thursday directs the Patient Protection Commission to devise recommendations for ensuring Nevada residents have more access to quality care statewide. The governor says the demand for care is expected to outpace the supply and Nevada must have a plan for growing its health care workforce. He notes that access to care is even more challenging for rural residents. Among other things, the commission will look at any administrative hurdles that might hinder the recruitment and retention of health care workers.",
