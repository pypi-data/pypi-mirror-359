The laws would allow terminally ill patients under specified conditions to end their lives with a doctor\u2019s help. Physician-assisted death is contentious and only 10 states and Washington, D.C., allow it. Patients must be at least 18 years old, within six months of death and be assessed by doctors to ensure they are capable of making an informed decision. Two states have gone in the opposite direction. Kansas has a bill to further criminalize those who help someone with their physician-assisted death. West Virginia is asking voters to enshrine its current ban into the state constitution.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>DENVER (AP) \u2014 On a brisk day at a restaurant outside Chicago, Deb Robertson sat with her teenage grandson to talk about her death.</p><p>She\u2019ll probably miss his high school graduation. She declined the extended warranty on her car. Sometimes she wonders who will be at her funeral.</p><p>Those things don\u2019t frighten her much. The 65-year-old didn\u2019t cry when she learned two months ago that the cancerous tumors in her liver were spreading, portending a tormented death.</p><p>But later, she received a call. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/minnesota-assisted-suicide-medical-aid-dying-835b13e42cfd424218b69f727632a291\">A bill moving</a> through the Illinois Legislature to allow certain terminally ill patients to end their own lives with a doctor\u2019s help had made progress.</p><p>Then she cried.</p><p>\u201cMedical-aid in dying is not me choosing to die,\u201d she says she told her 17-year-old grandson. \u201cI am going to die. But it is my way of having a little bit more control over what it looks like in the end.\u201d</p><p>That same conversation is happening beside hospital beds and around dinner tables across the country, as Americans who are nearing life\u2019s end negotiate the terms with themselves, their families and, now, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/minnesota-assisted-suicide-medical-aid-dying-835b13e42cfd424218b69f727632a291\">state lawmakers</a>.</p><p>At least <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-health-oregon-lawsuits-portland-3cf31cb519d84a47e2d3cb70e8f0bce7\">12 states currently have bills</a> that would legalize physician-assisted death. Eight states and Washington, D.C., already allow it, but only for their own residents. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/assisted-suicide-medical-aid-dying-vermont-bluestein-dfad23161758acf8a7aed2b20dea30ac\">Vermont and Oregon</a> permit any qualifying American to travel to their state for the practice. Patients must be at least 18 years old, within six months of death and be assessed to ensure they are capable of making an informed decision.</p><p>Two states have gone in the opposite direction. Kansas has a bill to further criminalize those who help someone with their physician-assisted death. West Virginia is asking voters to enshrine its current ban into the state constitution.</p><p>That patchwork of laws has left Americans in most states without recourse. Some patients choose to apply for residency in a state where it\u2019s legal. Others take arduous trips in the late-stage throes of disease to die in unfamiliar places and beds, far from family, friends and pets.</p><p>It was late at night when Rod Azama awoke to his wife crawling on the floor, screaming. Pain from her cancer had punched through the heavy morphine dose.</p><p>\u201cLet me die,\u201d screamed his wife, Susan.</p><p>As Rod rushed to hold her, the cries faded to repeated mumbles. \u201cHeaven,\u201d she said, again and again.</p><p>Susan, 68, pieced through her life\u2019s belongings \u2014 family heirlooms, photos, an antique spinning wheel \u2014 touching the memories a final time. Then she decided where their next lives would be.</p><p>She said goodbye to her constant sidekick, a small, fluffy Maltipoo named Sunny. Rod packed the dog\u2019s favorite toy, a stuffed bunny, as a reminder for Susan, who had to leave Sunny behind.</p><p>Then the two flew to Oregon.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/domestic-news-domestic-news-general-news-fb940964985343d1ba44dd19944ea7ff\">The issue is contentious</a>. Opponents, including many religious groups and lawmakers, have moral objections with the very concept of someone ending their life. Even with safeguards in place, they argue, the decision could be made for the wrong reasons, including depression or pressure from family burdened by their caretaking.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s normalizing suicide, and it\u2019s incentivizing individuals to end their lives,\u201d said Danielle Pimentel of <a href=\"https://aul.org/\">Americans United for Life</a>. Pimentel raised concerns that pain isn\u2019t the top reason people choose an early departure, adding that policy should focus on bettering end-of-life care.</p><p>Two national organizations lobbying for the bills argue it\u2019s about autonomy and compassion, some power over one\u2019s preordained exit.</p><p>\u201cIt comes down to the right of an individual to control their own end of life decisions free from government intervention or religious interference,\u201d said Goeff Sugerman, national campaign strategist <a href=\"https://deathwithdignity.org/\">Death with Dignity</a>.</p><p>Even though it\u2019s illegal in most states, <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/235145/americans-strong-support-euthanasia-persists.aspx\">a 2018 Gallup poll</a> showed more than two-thirds of Americans support physician-assisted death.</p><p>Only a small fraction of Americans nationwide, about 8,700, have used physician-assisted death since Oregon became the first state to legalize it in 1997, according to the <a href=\"https://www.compassionandchoices.org/\">advocacy group Compassion & Choices</a>. Most are cancer cases; others include heart and respiratory diseases. A third of people prescribed the medications don\u2019t end up using them.</p><p>Gary Drake planned to. He began a Facebook post on Feb. 13 with \u201cRIP.\u201d The 78-year-old was referring to himself. He was off to Oregon, and wouldn\u2019t be responding to any more messages and calls.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too busy and weak to do much more in this lifetime,\u201d he wrote.</p><p>The jovial businessman from Florida had watched a close friend decline from late-stage lung cancer, driving him to and from chemotherapy, until his friend shot himself. When Drake received a diagnosis around Christmas that his own lung, bone and kidney cancer would end his life within six months, he didn\u2019t deliberate long.</p><p>He signed off on Facebook: \u201cI love you all, say a prayer for me, and I\u2019ll see you on the other side. Bon Voyage.\u201d</p><p>The finality of the post prompted a flood of comments, as if he were attending his own funeral.</p><p>\u201cI know my dad and George are waiting to have a drink with you,\u201d someone wrote.</p><p>Less than three years ago Drake wouldn\u2019t have had the option. Oregon's residency requirement was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-health-oregon-lawsuits-portland-3cf31cb519d84a47e2d3cb70e8f0bce7\">rolled back in 2022</a> and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/assisted-suicide-vermont-residency-requirement-10ce4f29063f5bbb1873583f9aa89947\">Vermont's ended last year</a>, after successful federal lawsuits argued it was unconstitutional for states to deny the service to non-residents.</p><p>While debates to legalize the bills are playing out in Kentucky, Delaware, Maryland and Iowa, among others, the advocacy organization Compassion & Choices is using the courts to try to remove residency requirements.</p><p>\u201cPeople are dying right now who don\u2019t have the luxury for endless deliberation,\u201d said Kim Callinan, CEO and president of the group.</p><p>While California has a bill before lawmakers that would allow out-of-staters to access the procedure, that provision in a Colorado bill was stripped out. Three states, including Colorado, have proposals to expand in-state access, such as allowing advanced practice registered nurses, not just doctors, to prescribe the medication.</p><p>As Robertson discussed the topic with her grandson over noodles, he got teary eyed. If it became legal in Illinois tonight, would his grandmother be gone tomorrow? How does it differ from suicides that left empty seats at his school?</p><p>Robertson reassured him it would be the very last option as she embarks on a new chemo treatment. Then she explained the safeguards.</p><p>Typically, two doctors must confirm that a patient has six months to live. The patient must verbally request it twice with a waiting period that varies by state, and submit a written request with witnesses. At three meetings, a physician assesses the patient to ensure they are able to make an informed decision. The patient can be referred to a psychologist for an assessment if there are concerns.</p><p>Patients must take the medication themselves. They lose consciousness within a few minutes and usually die within a few hours.</p><p>Eventually the teenager met her eyes. \u201cGranny, I support whatever you choose to do,\u201d he said.</p><p>Robertson was glad she had the conversation. \u201cWhen you just think of the words \u2018medical-aid dying,\u2019 a 17-year-old gets stuck on the \u2018dying\u2019 part,\u201d she said.</p><p>Dr. Jess Kaan is no stranger to the controversy and fixation on the \u201cdying\u201d part. Living on the border between Oregon and Washington, she has worked on over 200 cases between the two states. A quarter of those traveled to Oregon.</p><p>Kaan has faced condemnation even from some fellow doctors, who accuse her of violating the Hippocratic oath of \u201cdo no harm.\u201d Kaan\u2019s own mother is aghast on religious grounds, and though it\u2019s become a major part of Kaan\u2019s life, the two have only spoken about it once.</p><p>For Kaan, it\u2019s a simple argument. She recalled watching a hospitalized patient with Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, slowly decline, tormented by an inexorable feeling of suffocation, until she died.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t die the death she wanted to die,\u201d Kaan said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just so convinced that death itself is not the enemy per se,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, the ethical principles upon me are beneficence, in that I feel that the relief of suffering is really what I\u2019m supposed to do as a physician.\u201d</p><p>As Drake prepared to fly to Oregon after posting on Facebook, he told his 12-year-old granddaughter that their special word would be \u201cLuLu,\u201d a tease over her obsession with the clothing brand Lululemon. Every time she saw it, he said, that would be him looking down from above.</p><p>\u201cThe last conversation she had with him was like any normal conversation that she\u2019s ever had with him. And that\u2019s the way she\u2019ll be able to remember him,\u201d said his son, Mitch Drake, 38.</p><p>Mitch flew to meet up with his father in Oregon in February. He thanked him for the life he had given him. They said their goodbyes.</p><p>Gary Drake drank the medicine as they played his song request: \u201cToes,\u201d by Zac Brown Band.</p><p>He put the cup down and sang.</p><p>\u201cI got my toes in the water, ass in the sand</p><p>Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand</p><p>Life is good today</p><p>Life is good today.\u201d</p><p>Then he fell asleep.</p><p>___</p><p>Bedayn is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative. <a href=\"https://www.reportforamerica.org/\">Report for America</a> is a nonprofit national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on undercovered issues.</p>",
