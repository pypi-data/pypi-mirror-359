Major hospital systems have taken months to iron out plans to administer Leqembi, which requires regular infusions and imaging scans. Some health insurers have rejected coverage, and doctors expect that some patients will hesitate to take Leqembi. Doctors say it will take years to learn more about how the drug works outside the controlled studies that led to its approval. In the meantime, they say much work must be done to improve diagnosis.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>The first drug shown to slow Alzheimer\u2019s disease hit the U.S. market over a year ago, but sales have lagged, major hospital systems have taken months to start using it and some insurers have rejected coverage.</p><p>Doctors also expect some patients will hesitate to take Leqembi due to its limited impact and potential side effects. They say it will take years to learn how best to deploy the drug and that work must be done to improve diagnosis.</p><p>\u201cThis is the start of a very exciting journey,\u201d said Dr. Ambar Kulshreshtha, a suburban Atlanta family physician focused on dementia patients.</p><p>More than 6 million Americans, and millions more worldwide, have Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the most common cause of dementia. There\u2019s no cure, but Leqembi clears a sticky brain protein called amyloid that\u2019s a key indicator of Alzheimer\u2019s.</p><p>Studies showed that it can delay the progression of the disease by a few months when given to people with mild symptoms. Some experts say the delay may be too subtle for patients to notice.</p><p>The drug also can cause brain swelling and bleeding. Patients need regular brain scans to monitor for that.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration gave Leqembi full approval last summer for patients with early stages of the disease. The federal Medicare program for people ages 65 and over covers Leqembi and the cost of scans needed to diagnose patients.</p><p>The drug's maker, Japan's Eisai, initially expected to have 10,000 patients taking the IV drug by the end of March. Company executives have since backed off that projection, though they say sales are growing.</p><p>Hospitals and health systems have needed more time than expected to set up their systems for delivering Leqembi, said Alexander Scott, an Eisai executive vice president.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we are adding a drug to an existing system,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are building the system for the drug.\u201d</p><p>The Cedars-Sinai health system in Los Angeles started administering the drug in early March. Getting there required months of meetings to iron out a plan to coordinate diagnosis, treatment and then monitoring for problems.</p><p>\u201cWe were very careful about it,\u201d said Dr. Sarah Kremen, a behavioral neurologist.</p><p>Banner Health in Arizona also recently started using Leqembi at a couple specialty clinics in Phoenix, a spokeswoman said.</p><p>\u201cThis is a very phased and staged approach,\u201d said Dr. Alireza Atri, a neurologist who has worked as a paid consultant for Eisai. \u201cAs we learn more, we\u2019ll expand and extend it.\u201d</p><p>The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, started using Leqembi in October but only for patients who live within a 100-mile radius so it can reach them quickly if they develop side effect symptoms. Doctors evaluate three to five patients every week for potential treatment, said Alzheimer\u2019s expert Dr. Ron Petersen.</p><p>Health systems are still trying to understand how coverage for the drug, its infusions and the needed scans works so patients don\u2019t get stuck with bills. That\u2019s a significant variable for a drug that can cost more than $26,000 a year.</p><p>An Eisai spokeswoman said nearly three-quarters of commercial plans in the U.S. cover the drug outside Medicare.</p><p>But doctors are concerned that coverage still may be tough for some patients, especially those too young to qualify for Medicare.</p><p>Insurance denials delayed Scott Berkheiser\u2019s first Leqembi infusion a few months until last December. The 57-year-old Venice, Florida, resident said the drugmaker eventually agreed to give it to him for free while he makes co-payments for the infusions.</p><p>\u201cIt was a little crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed like it was kind of a game that must make sense for some monetary reason.\u201d</p><p>Getting treatments started on time remains another challenge.</p><p>Texas Neurology had 60 patients screened as possible candidates for Leqembi and on a waitlist when the drug launched last year. Only eight eventually started treatment. The rest either declined to take it or had advanced beyond the mild phase of the disease when they were rescreened, CEO David Evans said.</p><p>\u201cThat window gets very short very quick,\u201d he said.</p><p>Doctors say more must be done to quickly identify patients and get treatment started before the disease advances. But that\u2019s a murky process.</p><p>If people mention memory trouble, doctors must rule out reversible causes like thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, medication issues or depression, Kulshreshtha said. Then memory tests for dementia can take a few visits.</p><p>Some patients may be ineligible for Leqembi because it would conflict with medication they already take to prevent strokes.</p><p>And then getting in to see a neurologist who prescribes the drug can take months.</p><p>Those who make it to the first infusion say the treatment process is manageable. Berkheiser says infusions have gone \u201clike clockwork\u201d since his delayed start.</p><p>He fits them in between his work as an engineer and training six days a week to compete in an Ironman triathlon.</p><p>Charles \u201cBum\u201d Clegg recently finished his 13th Leqembi infusion. The Salem, Alabama, resident visits a treatment center only 15 minutes from his home.</p><p>Clegg and his wife, Carol, say he has had no side effects, and his short-term memory has improved.</p><p>\u201cThis drug gives you hope,\u201d Carol said.</p><p>Treatment access may improve over time. The FDA is reviewing another potential treatment that targets amyloid protein, Eli Lilly and Co.\u2019s donanemab. Eisai is planning to seek approval for an injectable version of Leqembi that would be easier to use. Blood tests may eventually speed up amyloid detection.</p><p>But researchers say there\u2019s still a long road ahead. It\u2019s not clear what causes Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and many think combination treatments will be needed to stop it.</p><p>\u201cWe still have a lot to learn about Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d said Dr. Eric Widera a geriatric specialist with the University of California San Francisco. \u201cIt\u2019s complex, and it\u2019s much more than amyloid.\u201d</p><p>__</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
