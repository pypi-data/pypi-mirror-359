It can also bring intense feelings of stress or anxiety about dealing with finances. Financial stress during tax season can manifest in different ways, whether that\u2019s procrastinating on your tax return until the last minute or experiencing intense stress about filing incorrectly. If you\u2019re dealing with financial stress right now, you\u2019re not alone. Experts recommend that you make a plan to tackle your return step by step, ask for support from family and friends or a tax professional, and focus on self care if you're experiencing financial stress.",

It can also bring intense feelings of stress or anxiety about dealing with finances.</p><p>Financial stress during tax season can manifest in different ways, whether that's procrastinating on your <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tax-season-college-students-deduction-finance-c7a4a7869fd2b174630a7e1630a40184\">tax return</a> until the last minute or experiencing intense stress about filing incorrectly. If you\u2019re dealing with financial stress right now, you\u2019re not alone.</p><p>\u201cMany Americans experience high stress during tax times, and many Americans are dealing with financial stress,\u201d financial wellness expert Joyce Marter said.</p><p>You might think emotions and money don\u2019t go together, but they often affect each other, said Lindsay Bryan-Podvin, financial therapist and founder of Mind Money Balance.</p><p>\u201cOur money and mental health intersect because they\u2019re two parts of our overall wellness,\u201d said Bryan-Podvin.</p><p>Here are recommendations from experts to reduce financial stress during tax season while still getting your return done by the deadline:</p><hl2>Don't avoid, plan</hl2><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/holidays-gifts-budgeting-stress-finances-3bca475cc118d2441c663dfb95b8d23c\">Financial stress</a> can happen all year long. While tax season is only a window of time, it comes with something that can be daunting: a deadline. Some might find a deadline motivates them to get things done, while others can feel paralyzed by it, said Dr. Tanya Farber, psychologist at McLean Hospital, a mental health facility in Massachusetts.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re overwhelmed by our anxiety, that\u2019s where it may lead us to avoid thinking about finances or trying to avoid thinking about taxes,\u201d Farber said.</p><p>Although you do have an option of filing for an extension, Farber doesn\u2019t recommend prolonging the period when you have to worry about taxes. Instead, a good first step is to make a detailed plan to tackle them.</p><p>Farber recommends you break down all of the steps and start completing them one by one. A key step is to start gathering all of your documents, such as your W-2 or 1099 forms, savings and investment records, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tax-season-deductions-irs-finances-623b0abfc98353a03b781a337602a950\">eligible deductions</a> and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tax-season-filing-child-tax-credit-6893fe49a3db164937e6b7786b865db2\">tax credits</a>, ahead of sitting down to file your taxes. Once you have a list of steps, scheduling times to complete the tasks will make it easier to build momentum.</p><p>While the required documents might depend on your individual case, here is a general list of what everyone needs:</p><p>If you need help making a plan, search for tax checklists, which can be a great tool to make sure you have everything you need.</p><hl2>Face your fears</hl2><p>For many, anxiety over filing taxes comes from fear, Farber said. Whether it\u2019s fear of making a mistake in your return or unexpectedly owing thousands of dollars, these fears can overwhelm you to the point of avoiding even looking at your taxes.</p><p>If you identify that fear is what\u2019s stopping you from filing, Farber recommends that you ask yourself if whatever you're afraid of is likely to happen.</p><p>\u201cWhen we have fears, they\u2019re possible, probable or definite,\" Farber said. \u201cAnd oftentimes anxiety is the highest when we\u2019re assuming the worst-case scenario.\u201d</p><p>If thinking about your fears by yourself is not helping, Bryan-Podvin recommends you discuss them with a friend or a family member. In many cases, talking with someone else might help you focus on what might actually happen rather than focusing on the worst-case scenarios.</p><hl2>Focus on self care</hl2><p>If tax season brings a lot of financial stress for you, Bryan-Podvin recommends that you increase the amount of self-care activities you're doing. Activities such as taking a walk, spending time with your dog or getting enough sleep can help soothe stress.</p><p>\u201cWe are going to be doing things that are difficult and depleting and anxiety-provoking so doing more things that are restorative can help us balance that,\u201d Farber said.</p><p>Doing restorative activities can work as a toolbox of coping skills when you\u2019re in the middle of a stressful situation, like filing taxes.</p><hl2>Ask for support</hl2><p>You might feel like you'll be judged if you talk about money, but that's often not the case. Talking about finances with your friends or family can be a moment to receive support, she said.</p><p>\u201cTalking with others is going to give you access to more information and resources and also helps remove the shame and stigma because you\u2019re not alone,\u201d Marter said.</p><p>Whether it's talking with a tax professional or reaching out to your most tax-savvy family member, proactively seeking support will help you avoid being stressed if you\u2019re filing very close to the deadline.</p><p>Additionally, if you are experiencing mental health struggles, there are several resources you can use to find professional help.</p><p>In the U.S., you can dial 211 to speak with a mental health expert, confidentially and for free.</p><p>Other mental health resources include:</p><p>Veterans Crisis Line: call 1-800-273-TALK (8255)</p><p>Crisis Text Line: Text the word \u2018Home\u2019 to 741-741</p><p>The Trevor Lifeline for LGBTQ Youth: 1-866-488-7386</p><p>The Trans Lifeline: 1-877-565-8860</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.
