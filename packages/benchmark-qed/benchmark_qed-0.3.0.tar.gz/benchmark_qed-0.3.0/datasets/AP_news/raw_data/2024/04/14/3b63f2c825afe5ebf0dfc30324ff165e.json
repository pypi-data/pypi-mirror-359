    "description_summary": "Thousands of Polish opponents of abortion are marching in Warsaw to protest recent steps by the new government to liberalize the predominantly Catholic nation's strict laws and allow termination of pregnancy until the 12th week. Poland's Catholic Church has called for Sunday to be a day of prayer \u201cin defense of conceived life\u201d and has supported the march, organized by an anti-abortion movement. Last week, Poland's parliament, which is dominated by the liberal and pro-European Union ruling coalition, voted to approve further work on four proposals to lift the current near-ban on abortions. The procedure, which can take weeks or even months, is expected to be eventually rejected by conservative President Andrzej Duda, whose term runs for another year.",

Last month Duda vetoed a draft law that would have made the morning-after pill available over the counter from the age of 15.</p><p>A nation of some 38 million, Poland is seeking ways to boost the birth rate, which is currently at some 1.2 per woman \u2014 among the lowest in the European Union. Poland's society is aging and shrinking, facts that the previous right-wing government used among its arguments for toughening the abortion law.</p><p>Currently, abortions are only allowed in cases of rape or incest or if the woman\u2019s life or health is at risk. According to the Health Ministry, 161 abortions were performed in Polish hospitals in 2022. However, abortion advocates estimate that some 120,000 women in Poland have abortions each year, mostly by secretly obtaining pills from abroad.</p><p>Women attempting to abort themselves are not penalized, but anyone assisting them can face up to three years in prison. Reproductive rights advocates say the result is that doctors turn women away even in permitted cases for fear of legal consequences for themselves.</p><p>One of the four proposals being processed in parliament would decriminalize assisting a woman to have an abortion. Another one, put forward by a party whose leaders are openly Catholic, would keep a ban in most cases but would allow abortions in cases of fetal defects \u2014 a right that was eliminated by a 2020 court ruling. The two others aim to permit abortion through the 12th week.</p>",
