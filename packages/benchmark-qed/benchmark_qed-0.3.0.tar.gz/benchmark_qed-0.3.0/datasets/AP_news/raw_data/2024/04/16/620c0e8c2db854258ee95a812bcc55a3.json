    "description_summary": "The southern German state of Bavaria says it will ban the smoking of cannabis at public festivals, inside beer gardens and even at the world\u2019s most popular beer festival, the Oktoberfest. Local authorities in Bavaria will also be allowed to prohibit cannabis consumption in public areas such as outdoor swimming pools and leisure parks, German news agency dpa reported. Bavaria\u2019s move comes after Germany legalized possession of small amounts of cannabis for recreational use all over the country at the beginning of this month. Bavaria has a conservative-led state government that has been particularly vocal in its opposition to the partial legalization of cannabis.",
