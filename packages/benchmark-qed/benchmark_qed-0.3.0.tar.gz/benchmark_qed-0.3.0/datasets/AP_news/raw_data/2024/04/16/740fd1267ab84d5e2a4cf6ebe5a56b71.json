    "description_summary": "A campaign to legalize abortion in Missouri has raised close to $5 million. Missourians for Constitutional Freedom on Tuesday announced a $4.8 million haul from January through March. The money is needed to pay workers to gather the voter signatures necessary to put the measure on the ballot this year. The campaign needs to collect at least 172,000 voter signatures by May 5. If approved by voters, the measure would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. Lawmakers would still be able to regulate abortion after fetal viability. A rival anti-abortion campaign raised about $85,000 in the last three months.",

A rival anti-abortion campaign raised $85,000 in the same time period.</p><p>If approved by voters, the Missouri measure would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.

Wade in 2022. Missouri law only allows abortions for medical emergencies.</p><p>The abortion-rights campaign has until May 5 to gather signatures from 8% of legal voters in any six of the eight congressional districts. At minimum, that represents more than 171,000 valid voter signatures.</p><p>So far, the campaign has spent more than $3.4 million. Most of that \u2014 about $3.2 million \u2014 has gone to signature gathering and processing.</p><p>In Ohio, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ohio-abortion-amendment-election-2023-fe3e06747b616507d8ca21ea26485270\">a successful 2023 initiative</a> guaranteeing abortion rights cost a combined $70 million. Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, the campaign in favor of the initiative, raised and spent more than $39.5 million to pass the constitutional amendment. Protect Women Ohio, the campaign against it, raised and spent about $30.4 million.</p><p>It's unclear how close the Missouri campaign is to collecting the needed 171,000 signatures. The campaign said workers gathered close to 20,000 signatures in a one-day blitz on April 2 but declined to provide total signature numbers.</p><p>Monday was also the deadline for Missouri candidates to report recent fundraising.</p><p>Democrat Lucas Kunce outraised incumbent U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, bringing in more than $2.2 million to Hawley's $850,000. St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell raised $952,000 compared to his Democratic rival U.S. Rep. Cori Bush's $590,000.</p><p>Top Missouri gubernatorial fundraisers were Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who raised almost $557,000, and Democrat Mike Hamra. Hamra raised $512,000, including $500,000 in self-funding.</p><p>Most Missouri candidates also have political action committees that can fundraise and spend money to help elect them but cannot directly coordinate with the candidates or their campaigns. The numbers reported above do not include PAC fundraising.</p>",
