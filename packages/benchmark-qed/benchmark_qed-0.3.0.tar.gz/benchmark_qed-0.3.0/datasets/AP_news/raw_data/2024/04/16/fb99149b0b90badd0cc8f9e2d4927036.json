    "description_summary": "Texas is being fined $100,000 a day by a federal judge for neglecting investigations into abuse and neglect allegations raised by some of the 9,000 children it has in foster care. Judge Janis Jack in Corpus Christi found Texas and its Health and Human Services agency in contempt of court for the third time in a case that has been litigated since 2011. An agency spokesperson said the order is being reviewed. The judge issued a 427-page ruling describing a lack of thorough, accurate and timely investigations when children raise complaints. The fines will be lifted when the state can show compliance.",

After all these years, when will state leadership get serious about fixing this disaster?\u201d</p><p>Officials at the DFPS declined comment. A spokesperson at HHS said the agency, led by Commissioner Cecile E. Young, was reviewing the order.</p><p>Lawyers for the state have previously said that while there is always room for improvement, state officials have sufficiently complied with the court\u2019s remedial orders.</p><p>The state has also argued that the court monitors haven\u2019t reviewed a large enough sample size of children to make sweeping conclusions.</p><p>The fines levied against Texas will be lifted when the state can demonstrate that its investigations are in compliance. A hearing is set for late June.</p><p>Since 2019, court-appointed monitors have released periodic reports on DFPS progress toward eliminating threats to the foster children\u2019s safety.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2024/01/22/texas-cwop-foster-care-lawsuit/\">January report</a> cited progress in staff training, but continued weaknesses in responding to investigations into abuse and neglect allegations, including those made by children. Monitors also said children aren\u2019t told how to report sexual abuse and the state hasn't proved that it has properly trained its caseworkers to identify potential victims.</p><p>In one case, plaintiffs say, a girl was left in the same residential facility for a year while 12 separate investigations piled up around allegations that she had been raped by a worker there. The girl remained exposed to that worker until she was \u201cdumped in an emergency room, alone, with her jaw broken in two places,\u201d the judge said. The facility was eventually shut down by the state.</p>",
