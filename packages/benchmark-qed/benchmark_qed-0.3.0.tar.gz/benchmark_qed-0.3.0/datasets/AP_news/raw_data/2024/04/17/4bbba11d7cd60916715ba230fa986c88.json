    "description_summary": "Several U.S. courts have ruled this week on state laws restricting the rights of transgender young people. The Supreme Court said Idaho can enforce its ban against gender-affirming care for minors. A federal appeals court said West Virginia cannot keep a transgender girl from joining her school's track team. And an Ohio judge put on temporary hold a law that would ban gender-affirming healthcare for minors and keep transgender girls out of girls school sports. Most Republican-controlled states have adopted such laws, and many are being challenged in court. Meanwhile, there are more legislative efforts aimed at transgender people.",

The Supreme Court said Idaho can enforce its ban against gender-affirming health for minors while lawsuits proceed. An Ohio state judge put on hold a law against health care and sports participation that was about to kick in there. And a federal appeals court ruled that West Virginia cannot keep a transgender girl from participating on her school's track team.</p><p>Here are things to know about the court rulings and the latest legislative action.</p><hl2>OHIO JUDGE PUTS STATE LAW ON HOLD</hl2><p>On Tuesday, an Ohio judge blocked enforcement of a law that was to take effect on April 24, banning gender-affirming care for minors and keeping transgender girls off girls sports teams at schools.</p><p>Franklin County Judge Michael Holbrook said in his written opinion that it's likely the law, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-care-ohio-bans-veto-override-4877522111308e8c2c6cb1fef212ba0f\">adopted in January</a> with a legislative override of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine's veto, violates a requirement that the state's laws address just one issue. He noted that lawmakers added the ban on gender-affirming care to the sports-related legislation because they were unable to adopt it separately.</p><p>The ban on enforcement is in effect for two weeks or until a judge holds a hearing for a request to halt enforcement while the case works its way through the courts.</p><hl2>THE SUPREME COURT HAS ITS FIRST SAY ON A BAN</hl2><p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Monday that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-transgender-health-idaho-f858bcce9a624ec79edc496414f2130f\">Idaho can enforce its ban</a> on providing puberty blockers or hormones to minors.
