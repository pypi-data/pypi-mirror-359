Improvements in health care access have mostly benefited wealthier women and members of ethnic groups with better access to care, the fund said.</p><p>Kanem hailed some progress: More than 160 countries have passed laws against domestic violence, and \u201clegislation against LGBTQIA+ sexuality\u201d that was once widespread has been on the retreat. Now only one-third of countries have such laws.</p><p>While she credited \u201cthe world's agreement\u201d that led to such gains, Kanem also warned: \u201cHuman reproduction is being politicized. The rights of women, girls and gender diverse people are the subject of increasing pushback.\"</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, today, that progress is slowing. By many measures, it has stalled completely,\" she said. \u201cAnnual reductions in maternal deaths have flatlined. Since 2016, the world made zero progress in saving women from preventable deaths in pregnancy and childbirth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHealth systems today are weak,\" Kanem added. \"They\u2019re tainted by gender inequality, by racial discrimination and by misinformation.\u201d</p><p>The fund called for new investment in sexual and reproductive health, as well as improvements in sexuality education, stopping gender-based violence, and \u201cending unmet need for contraception\u201d \u2014 an issue that has driven a wedge in some countries.</p><p>Under the term of U.S. President Donald Trump, the United States <a href=\"https://apnews.com/united-states-government-f53043f0d4524279af1bfc58c709b420\">halted funding</a> for UNFPA largely over concerns about abortion \u2014 depriving the fund of tens of millions of dollars over four years.</p>",
