The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued updated its guidance to doctors on Thursday. They said the screening should be done at the first prenatal visit, during the third trimester and at birth. Previously, the group recommended one test in the third trimester, but only for those women considered at risk of getting syphilis during pregnancy or those living in communities with high rates of the disease. The screening is done with a blood test.",

Though the screening isn\u2019t required, health professionals generally follow the group\u2019s recommendations.</p><p>\u201cThe cases of congenital syphilis are definitely climbing, and they\u2019ve been climbing over the last 10 years. And it\u2019s completely preventable ... It\u2019s unacceptable,\" said Dr. Laura Riley, who chairs the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Weill Cornell Medicine and helped with the guidance. \"We need to be able to do better diagnostics and treatment.\u201d</p><p>Previously, the group recommended one test in the third trimester \u2014 but only for women considered at risk of getting syphilis during pregnancy or those living in communities with high rates of the disease. But this risk-based approach is \u201chow we get into trouble because we\u2019re missing cases,\u201d Riley said.</p><p>Earlier this year, the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/syphilis-newborns-cdc-std-testing-25df6e6352508fce37fb20ac10770124\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said</a> more than 3,700 babies were born with congenital syphilis in 2022, the most in more than 30 years. U.S. health officials called for stepping up prevention, including screening which is done with a blood test.</p><p>In its advisory, the OB-GYN group said CDC statistics show nearly 9 in 10 congenital syphilis cases that year \"could have been prevented with timely screening and treatment.\u201d</p><p>Infections during pregnancy are generally treated with at least two doses of penicillin. Babies born to women with untreated syphilis may be stillborn or die shortly after birth. The <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-congenital-syphilis.htm\">disease</a> can also cause other problems in newborns, such as deformed bones, severe anemia, blindness or deafness.</p><p>\u201cI hope that everyone takes it seriously,\" Riley said. Kids with congenital syphilis may have birth defects that can be devastating \u2014 \"which is incredibly sad.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
