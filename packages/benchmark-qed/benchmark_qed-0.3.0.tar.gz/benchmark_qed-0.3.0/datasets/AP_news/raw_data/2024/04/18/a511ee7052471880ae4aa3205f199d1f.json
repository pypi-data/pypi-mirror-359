News outlets report the Kentucky Vaping Retailers Association, the Kentucky Hemp Association and four vape retailers filed a lawsuit last week in Franklin Circuit Court challenging the constitutionality of the bill. It would require that any vape products sold have approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or have a \u201csafe harbor certification.\u201d They argue that the requirement would make most of their stock illegal and would put them out of business. Retailers say the bill violates the 14th amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which grants due process. State officials named as defendants declined to comment.",
