As a result, there are small amounts of mercury in the sediment of streams, lakes, rivers and oceans so nearly all fish contain trace amounts of mercury.</p><p>Health effects from harmful levels of mercury can include nervous system and kidney damage.</p><p>Eleven bodies of water, including Lake Maurepas, are now under an advisory for unacceptable levels of mercury in fish or shellfish. They are: Bayou Dorcheat in Webster Parish; Black Bayou Lake, Caddo; Black Lake and Clear Lake, Natchitoches and Red River parishes; Caddo Lake, Caddo; Corney Lake, Claiborne; Grand Bayou Reservoir, Plaquemines; Ivan Lake, Bossier; Kepler Creek Lake Bienville; Toledo Bend Reservoir, Sabine and DeSoto parishes and Vernon Lake, Vernon.</p>",
