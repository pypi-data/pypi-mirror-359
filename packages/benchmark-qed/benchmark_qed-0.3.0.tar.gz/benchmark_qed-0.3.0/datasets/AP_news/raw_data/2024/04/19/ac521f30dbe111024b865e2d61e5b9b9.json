    "description_summary": "Nevada's Supreme Court has handed setbacks to gun-right defenders and anti-abortion activists in two new rulings. Nevada\u2019s Supreme Court upheld the state\u2019s ban on ghost guns Thursday, overturning a lower court\u2019s ruling that had sided with a gun manufacturer\u2019s argument the 2021 law regulating firearm parts with no serial numbers was unconstitutionally vague. The high court said in a unanimous decision Thursday the law's language passes legal muster. Abortion rights advocates cheered the other ruling in a fight over a voter petition on reproductive health care. But they've since replaced it with another petition they're confident will qualify for the November ballot focused specifically on abortion rights.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>RENO, Nev. (AP) \u2014 Nevada's Supreme Court upheld a state ban on ghost guns Thursday, overturning a lower court's ruling that sided with a gun manufacturer's argument that the 2021 law regulating firearm components with no serial numbers was too broad and unconstitutionally vague.</p><p>Separately the court handed a setback to anti-abortion activists in a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-nevada-reproductive-freedom-bfaaacb4832115da76b6eb45882f60aa\">fight over a voter initiative</a> that no longer was headed to the November ballot anyway, a decision that abortion rights' advocates say nonetheless helps establish important legal guidelines regarding overall reproductive health care.</p><p>The gun law had previously been struck down by Lyon County District Judge John Schlegelmilch, who ruled in favor of a legal challenge by Nevada-based gun manufacturer Polymer80 Inc. that said the statute was too vague.</p><p>Among other things, Polymer80 argued, terms such as \u201cblank,\u201d \u201ccasting,\u201d and \u201cmachined body\u201d were not defined, while \u201cunfinished frame or receiver\u201d failed to specify what a \u201cfinished\u201d frame or receiver is.</p><p>In upholding the statute, the Supreme Court said in a unanimous decision that the language that lawmakers approved and then-Gov. Steve Sisolak signed was \u201creadily\u201d understandable through ordinary usage and common understanding.</p><p>\u201cThe statutes here only regulate conduct involving an object that is intended to ultimately become a firearm,\u201d Chief Justice Lydia Stiglich wrote in the ruling. \u201cThey prohibit acts involving such not-yet-complete firearms that have not been imprinted with a serial number. \u201d</p><p>She noted in the ruling that Polymer80's \u201cown legal counsel had written letters to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that included the words \u2018blank,\u2019 \u2018casting,\u2019 and \u2018machined\u2019 in reference to its own products, showing that these terms are commonly understood.\u201d</p><p>The fact that the terms were \u201cgeneric and broad\u201d does not make them vague, Stiglich added.</p><p>Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat who filed the appeal on the state's behalf in December 2021, said the ruling \u201cis a win for public safety and creates sensible, practical measures to protect Nevadans from violent crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ban on \u2018ghost guns\u2019 is one of the most impactful pieces of legislation that we have seen come through Carson City,\u201d he said in a statement.</p><p>Polymer80's legal counsel did not immediately respond to emails from The Associated Press seeking comment.</p><p>In the other decision Thursday, the high court rejected a Carson City judge's ruling that the initiative's description was misleading and violated requirements that it address a single subject by including abortion rights under the umbrella of reproductive health care.</p><p>\u201cThe medical procedures considered in the initiative petition concern reproduction. To assert that they could not all be addressed together because they are separate procedures is improper,\u201d the Supreme Court said. \u201cEach medical procedure relates to human reproduction and they are germane to each other and the initiative\u2019s single subject of establishing a right to reproductive freedom.\u201d</p><p>Abortion rights advocates hailed the decision even though they have already shifted their focus to a different and narrower initiative, which seeks to amend the state constitution and which they are are confident will make the November ballot after a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nevada-abortion-access-ballot-471e9036864c030cc5296e7c78da8dad\">judge ruled</a> that it had met legal muster.</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s ruling is an unequivocal recognition of what we\u2019ve always know to be true: The right to reproductive freedom includes all aspects of a person\u2019s reproductive health care,\u201d Lindsey Harmon, president of Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom, said in a statement.</p><p>A lawyer representing a group that was fighting the voter initiative, the Coalition for Parents and Children, said expressed disappointment.</p><p>\u201cThe Court has transformed the single-subject rule into the single-category rule, which will open the floodgates to broad and deceptive initiative proposals like the one at issue in this case,\u201d Jason Guinasso said via email. \u201cMy clients will now focus on educating the voters on why this proposal is bad law and policy for Nevadans.\u201d</p><p>Harmon said her group has gathered more than 160,000 signatures for the new ballot initiative \u2014 well above the 102,000 required by June 26 \u2014 and intends to submit them for validation that month. The measure would enshrine in the constitution current protections under a 1990 law that guarantee access to abortion through 24 weeks of pregnancy, or later to protect the health of the pregnant person.</p><p>Voters would need to approve it in both 2024 and 2026 to change the constitution.</p>",
