    "description_summary": "President Joe Biden frequently cites insulin prices as he promotes a $35 price cap for Americans with diabetes who are on Medicare. Roughly 8.4 million people use insulin, and more than 1 million have Type 1 diabetes and could die without regular access to the medication. The White House says nearly 4 million older people qualify for the new lower price, which Biden says compares with up to $400 monthly before. But many benefiting from the price cap were already paying far less and others were already Biden supporters. So that raises questions about how whether the issue can be as effective politically as the president believes.",

His reelection team has flooded swing-state airwaves with ads mentioning it, in English and Spanish.</p><p>All that would seemingly add up to a sweeping political and economic impact. The reality is more complicated.</p><p>As his campaign tries to emphasize what it sees as an advantage over presumptive Republican nominee <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</a>, Biden often overstates what those people who are eligible for the price cap once paid for insulin. It\u2019s also not clear whether the number of Americans being helped will be enough to help sway November\u2019s election, even in the most closely contested states that could come down to a few thousand votes.</p><p>\u201cIt is about political signaling in a campaign much more than it is about demonstrating for people that they benefit from the insulin cap,\u201d said Drew Altman, president and CEO of KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues. \u201cIt is a way to make concrete the fact that you are the health care candidate.\u201d</p><p>Many who are benefiting from the price cap were already getting insulin at reduced prices, were already Biden supporters, or both. Others who need reduced-price insulin, meanwhile, cannot get it because they do not have Medicare or private health insurance.</p><p>Biden\u2019s campaign is emphasizing the president's successful efforts to reduce insulin prices and contrasting that with <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump\">Trump</a>, who first ran for president promising to lower drug prices but <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-medication-prescription-drug-costs-medicare-prescription-drugs-e171198402445755b920842ded293b59\">took limited action</a> in office.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a powerful and tangible contrast,\u201d said Biden campaign spokesman Charles Lutvak. \u201cAnd it\u2019s one we are campaigning on early, aggressively, and across our coalition.\u201d</p><hl2>PRICE REDUCTIONS ACROSS THE BOARD</hl2><hl2></hl2><p>Roughly 8.4 million people in the United States control their blood sugar levels with insulin, and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-prices-diabetes-congress-a2f9986b7bf3500b81d1ec80a01e5abb\">more than 1 million have Type 1 diabetes</a> and could die without regular access to it. The White House says <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/02/fact-sheet-president-bidens-cap-on-the-cost-of-insulin-could-benefit-millions-of-americans-in-all-50-states/\">nearly 4 million</a> older people qualify for the new, lower price.</p><p>The price cap for Medicare recipients was part of the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/inflation-biden-health-climate-and-environment-7a267eeea21af0f44318e6b9d888c36c\">Inflation Reduction Act</a>, which originally sought to cap insulin at $35 for all those with health insurance. When it passed in 2022, it was scaled back by <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-medicare-diabetes-congress-ec99331904f454dcc2d82dce2cc4e005\">congressional Republicans</a> to apply only to older adults.</p><p>The Biden administration has also announced agreements with drugmakers Sanofi, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, to cap insulin co-payments at $35 for those with private insurance. They account for more than 90% of the U.S. insulin market.</p><p>But Biden says constantly that many people used to pay up to $400 monthly, which is an <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-845638742817\">overstatement</a>. A Department of Health and Human Services <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/b60f396f32e29a2a9469276d9ca80e4b/aspe-insulin-affordibility-rtc.pdf\">study released in December 2022</a> found that people with diabetes who were enrolled in Medicare or had private insurance paid an average of $452 annually, not monthly.</p><p>The high prices the president cites mostly affected people without health insurance. But the rates of the uninsured have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-health-us-department-of-and-human-services-government-politics-24684188cb67c576ed00d01b2f53c09c\">fallen to record lows</a> because of the Obama administration\u2019s signature health care law and the Biden White House\u2019s aggressive efforts to ensure those eligible to enroll are doing so more frequently.</p><p>So, in effect, one of the administration\u2019s policy initiatives is undermining the economic argument for another.</p><p>That effort has not reached everyone, though.</p><p>Yanet Martinez who lives in Phoenix and supports Biden. She does not work or have health insurance, but gets insulin for around $16 per month thanks to steep discounts at her local clinic.</p><p>The lower prices only apply if her husband, a landscaper, does not make enough to exceed the monthly income limit. If he does, her insulin can jump to $500-plus, she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard people talk about the price of insulin going down. I\u2019ve not seen it,\u201d said Martinez, 42. \u201cIt should be uniform. There are a lot of people who don\u2019t have any way to afford it and it makes things very difficult.\u201d</p><p>Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., is sponsoring bipartisan legislation to make the $35 insulin cap universal, even for people without health insurance. In the meantime, he said, what's been accomplished with Medicare recipients and drugmakers agreeing to reduce their prices is \"literally saving lives and saving people money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is good policy because it centers the people rather than the politics,\" Warnock said. He said that as he travels Georgia, a pivotal swing state in November, people say \u201cthank you for doing this for me, or for someone in my family.\u201d</p><p>That includes people like Tommy Marshall, a 56-year-old financial services consultant in Atlanta, who has health insurance. He was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 45 and injects fast-acting insulin several times daily. He paid about $250 for four weeks to eight weeks worth of medication last November, but saw the price fall by half in February, after Novo Nordisk agreed to cut prices.</p><p>\u201cIf I was his political consultant, I\u2019d be telling (Biden) to talk about it constantly,\" said Marshall, a lifelong Democrat and longtime public advocate for cutting insulin prices, including for the advocacy group Protect Our Care Georgia.</p><p>Marshall said the price caps \u201chave meaningful emotional resonance\u201d and could sway a close election but also conceded, \u201cYou\u2019re talking about 18- to 65-year-olds. I can just imagine there\u2019s probably two or three other issues that are in front of this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe someone sort of on-the-fence, he added \u201cthis could maybe sway them.\u201d</p><hl2>ONE OF BIDEN'S KEY ISSUES</hl2><hl2></hl2><p>Geoff Garin, a pollster for Biden's reelection campaign, said the insulin cap is one of the president's highest performing issues. He said the data was \u201cclear, consistent and overwhelming.\u201d</p><p>Rich Fiesta, executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans, which has endorsed Biden, called the insulin cap a strong issue for the president among older voters.</p><p>\u201cFor the persuadables \u2014 and there are some still out there, believe it or not \u2014 drug costs are a very important factor,\u201d said Fiesta, whose group has 4.4-million members and advocates for health and economic security for older people.</p><p>Trump's campaign did not respond to questions. But Theo Merkel, senior fellow at the conservative Paragon Health Institute, countered that the insulin price cut an example of \"policies written to fit the talking points other than the other way around.\u201d</p><p>Merkel, who was a Trump White House adviser on health policy, said manufacturers that have long made insulin prefer caps on how much the insured pay because it gives them more leverage to secure higher prices from insurance companies.</p><p>The president's approval ratings on health care are among his highest on a range of issues, but still only 42% of U.S. adults approve of Biden\u2019s handling of health care while 55% disapprove, according to <a href=\"https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/February-2024-topline-Biden.pdf\">a February poll</a> from The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.</p><p>KFF found in <a href=\"https://files.kff.org/attachment/Topline-KFF-Health-Tracking-Poll-November-2023.pdf\">its own poll</a> in December that that 59% of U.S. adults trust the Democratic Party to do a better job addressing health care affordability issues compared to 39% for Republicans, even if only 26% of respondents in the same poll said they knew about the insulin price cap.</p><p>\u201cIn political terms, the Democrats and Biden have an advantage on health care,\" Altman said. \u201cThey're pressing it.\u201d</p>",
