The 27-nation EU\u2019s executive Commission said it was opening formal proceedings to determine whether TikTok breached the bloc\u2019s new digital rules when it rolled out its TikTok Lite app in France and Spain. TikTok Lite is a slimmed down version of the main TikTok app that lets users earn rewards. The commission wants to see the risk assessment that TikTok should have carried out before deploying the app in the European Union.",

Points earned by watching videos, liking content and following content creators can then be exchanged for rewards including Amazon vouchers and gift cards on PayPal.</p><p>\u201cWe are disappointed with this decision,\u201d TikTok said in a statement. \u201cThe TikTok Lite rewards hub is not available to under 18s, and there is a daily limit on video watch tasks. We will continue discussions with the Commission.\u201d</p><p>The commission wants to see the risk assessment that TikTok should have carried out before deploying the app in the European Union. It's worried TikTok launched the app without assessing how to mitigate \u201cpotential systemic risks\u201d such as addictive design features that could pose harm to children.</p><p>\u201cWith an endless stream of short and fast-paced videos, TikTok offers fun and a sense of connection beyond your immediate circle,\u201d said European Commissioner Thierry Breton, one of the officials leading the bloc's push to rein in big tech companies. \u201cBut it also comes with considerable risks, especially for our children: addiction, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, low attention spans.\u201d</p><p>The EU is giving TikTok 24 hours to turn over the risk assessment and until Wednesday to argue its case. Any order to suspend the TikTok Lite app's reward features could come as early as Thursday.</p><p>It's the first time that the EU has issued a legally binding order for such information since the Digital Services Act took effect. Officials stepped up the pressure after TikTok failed to respond to last week's request for the information.</p><p>If TikTok still fails to respond, the commission warned the company also faces fines worth up to 1% of the company\u2019s total annual income or worldwide turnover and \u201cperiodic penalties\u201d of up to 5% of daily income or global turnover.</p><p>TikTok was already facing intensified scrutiny from the EU. The commission already has an ongoing <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/european-union-tiktok-digital-regulation-3fd249bbc9ff78a4401827c4b84b71a7\">in-depth investigation</a> into the main TikTok app's DSA compliance, examining whether it's doing enough to curb \u201csystemic risks\u201d stemming from its design, including \u201calgorithmic systems\u201d that might stimulate \u201cbehavioral addictions.\u201d Offices are worried that measures including age verification tools to stop minors from finding \u201cinappropriate content\u201d might not be effective.</p>",
