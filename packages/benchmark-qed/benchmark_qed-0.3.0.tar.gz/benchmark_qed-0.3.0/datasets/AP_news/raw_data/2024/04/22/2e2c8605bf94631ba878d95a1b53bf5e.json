Now as teenagers and young adults, they're providing input on public health initiatives, campaigning for social issues, distributing filters and providing free water testing for homeowners. The crisis was set in motion April 25, 2014, when the city of Flint halted the flow of water supplied by Detroit for decades. Flint stills struggles with issues like population loss, poverty and school achievement. But young activists say they hope to make a difference \u2014 and defy expectations.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>FLINT, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Their childhood memories are still vivid: warnings against drinking or cooking with tap water, enduring long lines for cases of water, washing from buckets filled with heated, bottled water. And for some, stomach aches, skin rashes and hair loss.</p><p>Ten years ago in Flint \u2014 April 25, 2014 \u2014 city and state environmental officials raised celebratory glasses as the mayor pressed a button to stop the flow of Lake Huron water supplied by Detroit for almost half a century. That set in motion a lead and bacteria public health crisis from which the city has not fully recovered.</p><p>But dozens of children of the water crisis \u2014 now teenagers and young adults \u2014 have turned their trauma into advocacy. They provide input on public health initiatives, participate in social issue campaigns, distribute filters and provide free water testing for homeowners.</p><p>They know that Flint is a place that still struggles. The population has fallen by some 20,000 in the past decade, leaving abandoned houses as targets for arsonists. Almost 70% of children live in poverty, and many struggle in school. Although the water has been declared safe to drink, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/environment-and-nature-michigan-water-quality-flint-b843f813feea5eddd43d10181204b054\">distrust runs deep</a>, and hundreds of lead water pipes <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/flint-lead-water-pipes-contempt-ruling-a402bcbd426fd4aec87b88f3836dd7c2\">remain in the ground</a> because homeowners were allowed to opt out of replacing them.</p><p>But the young activists say they want to help make a difference and change how their city is perceived by outsiders. And they want to defy expectations.</p><p>\u201cOne of the biggest issues about growing up in Flint is that people had already decided and predetermined who we were,\u201d said 22-year-old Cruz Duhart, a member of the Flint Public Health Youth Academy.</p><p>\u201cThey had ideas about our IQ, about behavioral things, but they never really stopped to speak to us and how we thought about it and the type of traumas that we were going through.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>It's always been easiest for 16-year-old Sima Gutierrez to express herself through art. Drawings, paintings and wire sculptures decorate her family's tidy bungalow.</p><p>Now the self-described \u201cvery shy\u201d teen who rarely spoke up for fear nobody wanted to hear what she had to say collects water samples in people's homes and takes them to the Flint Community Water Lab, where more than 60 high school and college interns have provided free testing for thousands of residents since 2020.</p><p>She helped plan public awareness campaigns about topics like gun violence and how racism affects public health as a member of the Flint Public Health Youth Academy.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to be surrounded by people who weren\u2019t going to cover up the whole fact that people are still having problems,\u201d said Sima. \u201cI was able to ... share my life (with) anybody else who\u2019s going through what I\u2019m going through.\u201d</p><p>It was a decade ago that she complained her stomach hurt when she drank water. Her mom insisted it would help Sima's body flush out medication she took for an autoimmune disorder that was causing her hair to fall out in patches and leaving her skin with light splotches.</p><p>Residents had begun reporting skin rashes and complaining about discolored, smelly and foul-tasting water soon after the city began drawing from the Flint River to save money, until it could hook into a new Lake Huron pipeline. But they were assured everything was fine.</p><p>Sima said she wasn't aware of problems until one of her elementary school classmates, Mari Copeny \u2014 then a 7-year-old beauty pageant winner known as Little Miss Flint \u2014 began protesting. Mari became the face of the crisis, and continues to highlight environmental justice issues to almost 200,000 Instagram followers and to raise money, including for water filters that she gives out in communities across the U.S.</p><p>\u201cI want to keep on using my voice to spread awareness about the Flint water crisis because it\u2019s not just Flint that has a water crisis,\" Mari said. \"America has a water crisis.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Almost a year and a half after Flint made its switch, residents frustrated with the water quality reached out to an expert who then found high lead levels caused by the city's failure to add chemicals that prevent pipe corrosion. State officials had said these were unnecessary. Around that same time, a pediatrician discovered that levels in kids' blood had doubled after the switch.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6309965/\">Outbreaks of Legionnaire's</a> disease, including a dozen deaths, ultimately were also linked, in part, to the city's water supply.</p><p>Flint reconnected to its old water line shortly afterward, but pipes continued to release lead. The state provided residents filters and bottled water.</p><p>Lead is a potent neurotoxin that can damage children's brains and nervous systems and affect learning, behavior, hearing and speech. There is no safe childhood exposure level and problems can manifest years later.</p><p>Data collected over a decade now show that children in Flint have higher rates of ADHD, behavioral and mental health problems and more difficulty learning than children assessed before the water crisis, said Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, the pediatrician who first flagged rising lead levels in Flint kids\u2019 blood. She said other issues, including nutrition, poverty, unemployment and systemic inequalities also could be factors.</p><p>Sima and three of her sisters were found to have elevated lead levels and have since been diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; Sima also has a learning difficulty.</p><p>\u201cI felt responsible for forcing my child to drink something that was hurting her so bad, and I didn\u2019t believe her,\u201d said her mother, Jessica Gutierrez, who works as a public health advocate for hospitals and nonprofits and fears for her daughters' long-term health.</p><p>Guilt and anxiety are \u201cpart of the trauma of the crisis,\u201d Hanna-Attisha said.</p><p>That's why it's important for kids from Flint to feel they're being heard, to be part of the solutions, she said. For example, the Flint Youth Justice League, an advisory board to her <a href=\"https://msuhurleypphi.org/\">Pediatric Public Health Initiative</a>, has offered suggestions on programs that include prescribing fresh fruits and vegetables, reducing poverty and connecting residents to public services.</p><p>\u201cOur young people are amazing,\u201d said Hanna-Attisha. \u201cThey are not okay with the status quo and they are demanding that we do better for them and for generations to come.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Asia Donald remembers feeling helpless and bewildered when her little sister developed rashes and her mom boiled pot after pot of bottled water for baths.</p><p>But just a couple years later, she was talking to kids from Newark, New Jersey, guiding them through their own lead-in-water crisis. Over Zoom meetings, the kids from Flint explained parts per billion, how to test water for lead and how they had coped with fear.</p><p>\u201cThey felt the exact same way that I felt when I was ... going through it,\u201d said Asia, 20, now an aspiring accountant and one of 18 interns at the <a href=\"https://www.cestudioflint.org/youthacademy\">Flint Public Health Youth Academy.</a></p><p>They're paid a monthly stipend to run the academy \u2014 writing grants, creating budgets, analyzing data, conducting focus groups and creating public awareness campaigns. They have a biweekly talk show on YouTube, where they\u2019ve discussed everything from mental health to COVID.</p><p>Last summer, they planned and hosted a summer camp for dozens of kids that focused on gun violence and school shootings. This year, together with the Community Foundation of Greater Flint, they're coordinating a youth summit on community violence.</p><p>Dr. Kent Key, a public health researcher with the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine in Flint, started the academy after studying health disparities in the Black community as part of his doctoral dissertation.</p><p>He wanted to introduce Black kids to potential health careers, but also felt like \u201ceveryone had written Flint youth off because of the impacts of lead.\u201d So he gave them more than a voice, he said. He gave them control.</p><p>\u201cI did not want (the water crisis) to be a sentence of doom and gloom for youth,\u201d he said. \u201c I wanted it to be a catapult ... to launch the next generation of public health professionals.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Dionna Brown, who was 14 when the water crisis began, became interested in advocacy after taking a class on environmental inequality at Howard University. Now she\u2019s planning her life around it \u2014 completing a master\u2019s degree in sociology from Wayne State University with plans to become an environmental justice attorney.</p><p>She's also national director of the youth environmental justice program at Young, Gifted & Green, formerly called Black Millennials for Flint and founded by advocates from Washington to support Flint after the crisis.</p><p>Brown holds a two-week summer environmental justice camp in Flint every year to teach teens about issues such as policy, climate justice, sustainability and housing disparities. She also works with kids in Baltimore and Memphis.</p><p>She said the water crisis made Flint kids resilient.</p><p>\u201cI tell people all the time: I\u2019m a child of the Flint water crisis,\u201d said Brown. \u201cI love my city. And we put the world on notice that you cannot just poison a city and we\u2019ll forget about it.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press video journalist Mike Householder contributed to this story.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.
