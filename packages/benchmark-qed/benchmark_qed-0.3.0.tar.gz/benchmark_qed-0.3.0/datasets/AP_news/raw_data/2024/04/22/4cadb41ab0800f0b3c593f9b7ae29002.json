    "description_summary": "Dozens of the children of Flint, Michigan\u2019s lead-contaminated water crisis have turned their trauma into advocacy 10 years after it began. Now as teenagers and young adults, they\u2019re providing input on public health initiatives, campaigning for social issues, distributing filters and providing free water testing for homeowners. The crisis was set in motion April 25, 2014, when the city of Flint halted the flow of water that had been supplied by Detroit for decades. Flint stills struggles with population loss, poverty and school achievement. But young activists say they hope to make a difference \u2014 and defy expectations.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>Their childhood memories are vivid: warnings against drinking or cooking with tap water, enduring long lines for cases of water, washing from buckets filled with heated, bottled water.</p><p>But the children of the Flint water crisis \u2014 set in motion April 25, 2014, when the city began drawing water from the Flint River \u2014 have turned their trauma into advocacy.</p><p>They know Flint still struggles: Its population has fallen by about 20,000 in the past decade, leaving abandoned houses frequently targeted by arsonists. More than two-thirds of children live in poverty, and many struggle in school.</p><p>But young activists say they want to help make a difference, change how their city is perceived by outsiders \u2014 and defy expectations.</p><p>\u201cOne of the biggest issues about growing up in Flint is that people had already decided and predetermined who we were,\u201d said 22-year-old Cruz Duhart, a member of the Flint Public Health Youth Academy.</p><p>\u201cThey had ideas about our IQ, about behavioral things, but they never really stopped to speak to us and how we thought about it and the type of traumas that we were going through.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Sima Gutierrez collects water samples from residents' homes and takes them to the Flint Community Water Lab, where more than 60 high school and college interns have provided free testing for thousands of residents since 2020.</p><p>She helps plan public awareness campaigns about topics like gun violence and how racism affects public health as a member of the Flint Public Health Youth Academy.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to be surrounded by people who weren\u2019t going to cover up the whole fact that people are still having problems ... to share my life (with) anybody else who\u2019s going through what I\u2019m going through,\u201d said Sima, 16.</p><p>A decade ago, she complained about stomach pains when she drank water, but her mom believed it helped Sima\u2019s body flush medication she took for an autoimmune disorder that was causing her hair to fall out in patches and leaving her skin splotchy.</p><p>Sima and three of her sisters were found to have elevated lead levels and have been diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; Sima also has a learning difficulty, her mother said.</p><p>Residents had been assured the water was safe when many complained of skin rashes and discolored, smelly and foul-tasting water after the city disconnected from Detroit-supplied water to save money.</p><p>But a year and a half later, a water expert found high lead levels in the tap water, caused by the city's failure to add anti-corrosion chemicals, which state environmental officials said was unnecessary. A physician also discovered that levels in kids\u2019 blood had doubled.</p><p>The potent neurotoxin can damage children\u2019s brains and nervous systems and affect learning, behavior, hearing and speech. There is no safe childhood exposure level, and problems can manifest years later.</p><p>Data collected over a decade now show that Flint children have higher rates of ADHD, behavioral and mental health problems and more difficulty learning than those assessed before the water crisis, said Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, the pediatrician who flagged rising lead levels in Flint kids\u2019 blood. She said issues such as nutrition, poverty, unemployment and systemic inequalities also could be factors.</p><p>But Flint kids are resilient, she said, and have made important contributions to the city's recovery. The Flint Youth Justice League, an advisory board to her Pediatric Public Health Initiative, for example, has offered advice on programs to reduce poverty and connect residents to public services.</p><p>\u201cOur young people are amazing,\u201d said Hanna-Attisha. \u201cThey are not okay with the status quo and they are demanding that we do better for them and for generations to come.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Asia Donald remembers feeling helpless and bewildered when her little sister developed rashes and her mom boiled pot after pot of bottled water for baths.</p><p>But a couple years later, she was guiding kids from Newark, New Jersey, as they experienced their own water crisis. Over Zoom meetings, the kids from Flint explained parts per billion, how to test water for lead and how they'd coped with fears.</p><p>\u201cThey felt the exact same way that I felt when I was ... going through it,\u201d said Asia, 20, one of 18 interns at the <a href=\"https://www.cestudioflint.org/youthacademy\">Flint Public Health Youth Academy.</a></p><p>They\u2019re paid a monthly stipend to run the academy \u2014 writing grants, creating budgets, analyzing data, running meetings and creating public awareness campaigns. They have a biweekly talk show on YouTube, where they\u2019ve discussed everything from mental health to COVID.</p><p>Dr. Kent Key, a public health researcher with the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine in Flint, started the academy after studying health disparities in African American communities as part of his doctoral dissertation.</p><p>\"I felt like everyone had written Flint youth off,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not want (the water crisis) to be a sentence of doom and gloom ... I wanted it to be a catapult to launch the next generation of public health professionals.\u201d</p><p>One of the academy's frequent partners is Young, Gifted & Green.</p><p>Flint resident Dionna Brown, national director of the organization's youth environmental justice program, plans a two-week summer environmental justice camp in Flint every year. Teens learn about policy, climate justice, sustainability and housing disparities.</p><p>Brown became interested in advocacy during a class on environmental inequality at Howard University. Now she plans to become an environmental justice attorney.</p><p>\u201cI tell people all the time: I\u2019m a child of the Flint water crisis,\u201d said Brown, who was 14 when it began. \u201cI love my city. And we put the world on notice that you cannot just poison a city and we\u2019ll forget about it.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.
