Viasna said in a report published on Monday that it identified 93 prisoners of particular concern who are suffering from cancer, heart disease and other conditions that are neglected or poorly treated behind bars. Belarus started a harsh crackdown on opposition after large protests arose across the country following August 2020 elections who disputed results gave authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko a sixth term in office.",
