Ana Estrada is the first person in the country to obtain the right to die with medical assistance. She had fought for years in Peruvian courts for the right to die with dignity, and became a celebrity in the conservative country where euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal. In 2022, Estrada was granted an exception by the nation\u2019s Supreme Court, which upheld a ruling by a lower court that gave Estrada the right to decide when to end her life. It also said that those who helped her would not be punished.",

Estrada became the first person to obtain the right to die with medical assistance in Peru.</p><p>\u201cAna\u2019s struggle for her right to die with dignity has helped to educate thousands of Peruvians about this right and the importance of defending it,\u201d her lawyer, Josefina Mir\u00f3 Quesada, said in a statement. \u201cHer struggle transcended our nation\u2019s borders.\u201d</p><p>Estrada, 47, had an incurable disease called polymyositis that wastes away muscles. She began to present the first symptoms as a teenager and started to use a wheelchair at the age of 20 because she had lost the strength to walk.</p><p>Estrada obtained a psychology degree and became a therapist. She earned enough money to buy her own apartment and became independent from her parents.</p><p>By 2017, however, Estrada\u2019s condition worsened and she could no longer get up from her bed. She had difficulty breathing and survived pneumonia. And even though she could not type, Estrada used transcription software to produce a blog called \u201cAna for a death with dignity,\u201d where she discussed her struggles and her decision to seek euthanasia.</p><p>\u201cI am no longer free,\u201d she said in an interview with the Associated Press in 2018. \u201cI am not the same person I was before.\u201d</p><p>With the help of Peru\u2019s Human Rights Ombudsman, Estrada won a lawsuit that gave her the right to die with euthanasia. From her bed, she participated in court sessions through video conferences.</p><p>Estrada told judges in 2022 that she valued life, and did not want to die immediately, but wanted to have the freedom to decide when to end her life.</p><p>\u201cI want to accede to euthanasia when I can no longer sustain suffering in life,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when I decide to bid farewell to my loved ones in peace and with tranquility.\u201d</p><p>Only a handful of countries have legalized euthanasia, including Canada, Belgium and Spain. Some U.S. states, including Maine and Oregon, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/medical-aid-dying-legal-physician-assisted-suicide-b67affd86c1d1ce99379ed34bdb2946b\">allow physician-assisted suicide</a>, where a doctor provides a terminally ill patient with the means to end their life.</p><p>Euthanasia is illegal in most Latin American countries except for Colombia, which legalized it in 2015, and Ecuador, which <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ecuador-decriminalizes-euthanasia-terminally-ill-woman-7fff5e69f99ec573e13396a31b037d74\">decriminalized the practice in February</a>.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america\">https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america</a></p>",
