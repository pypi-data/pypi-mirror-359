    "description_summary": "The Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday in a case that could determine whether doctors can provide abortions to pregnant women with medical emergencies in states that enact abortion bans. The Justice Department has sued Idaho over its abortion law, which allows a woman to get an abortion only when her life, not her health, is at risk. The Idaho law has raised questions about when a doctor is able to provide the stabilizing treatment federal law requires. The federal law is called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA. EMTALA requires doctors to stabilize or treat any patient who shows up at an emergency room.",

The state law has raised questions about when a doctor is able to provide the stabilizing treatment that federal law requires.</p><p>The federal law, called the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pregnancy-emergency-care-abortion-supreme-court-roe-9ce6c87c8fc653c840654de1ae5f7a1c\">Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act</a>, or EMTALA, requires doctors to stabilize or treat any patient who shows up at an emergency room.</p><p>Here\u2019s a look at the history of EMTALA, what rights it provides patients and how a Supreme Court ruling might change that.</p><hl2>WHAT PROTECTIONS DOES EMTALA PROVIDE ME AT AN ER?</hl2><p>Simply put, EMTALA <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/files/document/emtala-know-your-rights.pdf\">requires emergency rooms</a> to offer a medical exam if you turn up at their facility. The law applies to nearly all emergency rooms \u2014 any that accept Medicare funding.</p><p>Those emergency rooms are required to stabilize patients if they do have a medical emergency before discharging or transferring them. And if the ER doesn\u2019t have the resources or staff to properly treat that patient, staff members are required to arrange a medical transfer to another hospital, after they\u2019ve confirmed the facility can accept the patient.</p><p>So, for example, if a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pregnancy-emergency-care-abortion-supreme-court-roe-9ce6c87c8fc653c840654de1ae5f7a1c\">pregnant woman shows up at an emergency room</a> concerned that she is in labor but there is no OB/GYN on staff, hospital staff cannot simply direct the woman to go elsewhere.</p><hl2>WHY WAS THIS LAW CREATED?</hl2><p>Look to <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/1986/02/27/hospital-study-poor-dumped-on-county/\">Chicago</a> in the early 1980s.</p><p>Doctors at the city\u2019s public hospital were confronting a huge problem: Thousands of patients, many of them Black or Latino, were arriving in very bad condition \u2014 and they were sent there by private hospitals in the city that refused to treat them. Most of them did not have health insurance.</p><p>Chicago wasn\u2019t alone. Doctors working in public hospitals around the country reported similar issues. Media reports, including one of a pregnant woman who delivered a stillborn baby after being turned away by two hospitals because she didn\u2019t have insurance, intensified public pressure on politicians to act.</p><p>Congress drafted legislation with Republican Sen. David Durenberger of Minnesota <a href=\"https://studylib.net/doc/6769781/emtala---politics-and-government--illinois-state#google_vignette\">saying at the time</a>, \u201cAmericans, rich or poor, deserve access to quality health care. This question of access should be the government\u2019s responsibility at the federal, state, and local levels.\u201d</p><p>Then-President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, signed the bill into law in 1986.</p><hl2>WHAT HAPPENS IF A HOSPITAL TURNS AWAY A PATIENT?</hl2><p>The hospital is investigated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. If they find the hospital violated a patient\u2019s right to care, they can lose their Medicare funding, a vital source of revenue for most hospitals to keep their doors open.</p><p>Usually, however, the federal government issues fines when a hospital violates EMTALA. They can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p><hl2>WHY IS THE SUPREME COURT LOOKING AT THE LAW?</hl2><p>Since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has repeatedly reminded hospitals that his administration considers an abortion part of the stabilizing care that EMTALA requires facilities to provide.</p><p>The Biden administration argues that Idaho\u2019s law prevents ER doctors from offering an abortion if a woman needs one in a medical emergency.</p><p>But Idaho\u2019s attorney general has pointed out that EMTALA also requires hospitals to consider the health of the \u201cunborn child\u201d in its treatment, too.</p><hl2>WHAT ARE ADVOCATES SAYING?</hl2><p>Anti-abortion advocates argue that state laws banning abortion can coexist with the federal law that requires hospitals to stabilize pregnant patients in an emergency.</p><p>The prominent anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America called the lawsuit in Idaho a \u201cPR stunt,\u201d in a statement to The Associated Press on Tuesday.</p><p>\u201cThe EMTALA case is based on the false premise that pregnant women cannot receive emergency care under pro-life laws,\" said Kelsey Pritchard, the group\u2019s state public affairs director. \"It is a clear fact that pregnant women can receive miscarriage care, ectopic pregnancy care and treatment in a medical emergency in all 50 states.\"</p><p>But many doctors say it\u2019s not as clear cut as anti-abortion advocates claim. Idaho\u2019s state law banning abortion, except for the life of the mother, has left some doctors weighing if a patient is close enough to death to treat.</p><p>Most other states allow doctors to perform abortions to save the health of a mother. But, if the Supreme Court rules in Idaho\u2019s favor, it could invite other states to pass restrictions without that exemption.</p><p>In a statement released Monday, Jack Resneck, the former president of the American Medical Association, said Idaho\u2019s law forces doctors to withhold proper treatment for patients.</p><p>The state\u2019s \u201cdangerous standard cannot be applied to the real-life situations faced in emergency departments every day,\u201d Resneck said. \u201cThere is no bright line when each patient\u2019s condition suddenly reaches \u201clife-threatening,\u201d and deteriorating patients don\u2019t want their physicians delaying care.\u201d</p>",
