    "description_summary": "Nearly two years after overturning the constitutional right to abortion, the Supreme Court will consider how far state abortion bans can extend to women in medical emergencies. The justices are weighing a case Wednesday from Idaho, where a strict abortion ban went into effect shortly after the high court\u2019s 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade. The Biden administration argues that hospitals must be allowed to terminate pregnancies in emergencies where a patient\u2019s health is at serious risk. Idaho says the Biden administration is trying to expand the definition of emergencies and turn hospitals into \u201cabortion enclaves.\u201d Doctors say the state\u2019s strict abortion ban has already affected emergency pregnancy care, forcing more women to be flown out of state for treatment.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Nearly two years after overturning the constitutional right to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/abortion\">abortion</a>, the Supreme Court will consider Wednesday how far state bans can extend to women in medical emergencies.</p><p>The justices are weighing a case from Idaho, where a strict abortion ban went into effect shortly after the high court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade. The case marks the first time the Supreme Court has considered a state ban since then, and comes as the justices consider another case \u2014 still pending \u2014 seeking to restrict access to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-abortion-mifepristone-telemedicine-4406d53e8af90f6a523264f535f5adf8\">abortion medication</a>.</p><p>The Biden administration argues that hospitals must be allowed to terminate pregnancies in rare emergencies where a patient's life or health is at serious risk, even in states where abortions are banned. Idaho says its law does have an exception for life-saving abortions, and it contends the Biden administration wants to define health emergencies more broadly to turn hospitals into \u201cabortion enclaves.\"</p><p>Idaho is one of 14 states that now ban abortion at all stages of pregnancy with limited exceptions. Most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions since Roe was overturned, and 22 states filed court papers supporting Idaho. The Supreme Court has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-abortion-medical-emergencies-idaho-8ca89d7de0c1fa9256dcd27d1847e144#:~:text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20is%20allowing,ban%2C%20even%20in%20medical%20emergencies&text=WASHINGTON%20(AP)%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Supreme,while%20a%20legal%20fight%20continues.\">allowed the Idaho abortion ban</a> to go into effect, even during emergencies, as the case played out.</p><p>Idaho's ban has already affected <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pregnancy-emergency-care-abortion-supreme-court-roe-9ce6c87c8fc653c840654de1ae5f7a1c\">emergency care</a> in the state, said Dr. Jim Souza, the chief physician executive of Boise-based St. Luke\u2019s Health System. Since the law went into effect for emergencies in January, six pregnant emergency-room patients have had to be flown out of state for treatment. Just one needed a similar emergency flight in all of 2023, he said.</p><p>Abortion is considered routine treatment for some pregnancy emergencies, like when a woman\u2019s water breaks before a fetus is viable. Idaho doctors see a patient at least weekly with that issue, which puts women at risk for infection, sepsis and hemorrhage. But in order to stay within bounds of Idaho\u2019s abortion law, doctors now must wait to ensure those patients are close to death before offering abortion treatment, Souza said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of second-guessing and hand-wringing. Is she sick enough? Is she bleeding enough?\u201d he said.</p><p>Attorneys for the state of Idaho contend the exceptions to its abortion ban do allow for life-saving abortions, as well as treatment for ectopic pregnancies and accidental terminations in emergencies. The state says the Biden administration has overstated healthcare woes to create a backdoor despite the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling putting abortion in the hands of the states.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the government crying wolf in the hopes of persuading the justices to adopt a position contrary to what the law says,\u201d said John Bursch, an attorney with the group Alliance Defending Freedom and Idaho co-counsel.</p><p>The Justice Department originally brought the case against Idaho, arguing the state\u2019s abortion law is in conflict with the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-idaho-emergency-care-000a2482fdd1f1299599c91a6cc7635a\">known as EMTALA.</a> It requires hospitals that accept Medicare to provide emergency care to any patient regardless of their ability to pay. Nearly all hospitals accept Medicare.</p><p>Two weeks after Roe was overturned, the Democratic Biden administration put out guidance saying the law requires abortions in emergencies with serious life or health threats.</p><p>The Idaho suit was filed shortly after. A district court judge initially sided with the administration and ruled that abortions were allowed in medical emergencies, but after wrangling at the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals the Supreme Court sided with Idaho and allowed the law to go fully into effect in January.</p><p>Idaho says the law is meant to ensure patients are stabilized by hospitals rather than turned away, and doesn't dictate an exact standard of care.</p><p>The Biden administration\u2019s reading of the law would open a \u201c'mental health' loophole for abortion\u201d and allow doctors to make subjective determinations about what constitutes a serious health threat, the state argues. \u201cEMTALA does not require emergency rooms to become abortion enclaves in violation of state law.\"</p><p>The law also says hospitals are responsible for stabilizing \u201cthe health of the woman or her unborn child,\u201d language that indicates there wasn\u2019t an expectation that it would require abortions, Idaho argued. \u201cBoth EMTALA and the Idaho Defense of Life Act are life affirming laws. There\u2019s no conflict between them,\u201d Bursch said.</p><p>The Justice Department says the language refers to labor and delivery and doesn't preclude hospitals from stabilizing a woman with necessary treatment, especially when serious risks to her health also endanger a fetus. Its reading of the law would cover only abortions needed to stabilize a patient, relatively rare situations that can have \u201clife altering consequences,\u201d federal attorneys wrote.</p><p>If the Supreme Court sides with Idaho, it could push more doctors to leave states with abortion bans and expand \u201c <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/birthing-rural-hospitals-maternity-care-births-e67a91d927eb545459e83bc7b2b95a0d\">maternity care deserts,</a> \u201d said Dr. Caitlin Gustafson, an Idaho physician. Nearly a quarter of obstetricians and more than half of maternal fetal medicine doctors have left Idaho since shortly after Roe was overturned, according to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/idaho-abortion-ban-doctors-leaving-f34e901599f5eabed56ae96599c0e5c2\">a study released</a> in February. Abortion opponents, meanwhile, say that a lack of healthcare access, especially in rural areas, is a wider issue that's not necessarily related to abortion bans.</p><p>A win for the state could also weaken the emergency healthcare protections that EMTALA provides across the country, said Molly Duane, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights. \u201cWho is overseeing these hospitals and making sure the patients get the lifesaving and health saving care that they need to protect themselves, their families, the pregnancies, their future pregnancies?\u201d Duane said.</p><p>The Biden administration is also facing other court battles over its guidance on abortions and emergency care. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-life-of-mother-texas-appeal-83770a43f44c908d81b5fa0dfc0d87e4\">ruled against the administration</a> in January, finding that EMTALA does not require Texas hospitals to provide abortions in emergency rooms. The Justice Department has appealed that decision, but asked the high court to wait until ruling in the Idaho case.</p><p>The Supreme Court is expected to rule by the end of June.</p>",
