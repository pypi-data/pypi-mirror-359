You\u2019re not alone.</p><p>Nearly <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/index.html\">one-third of American adults</a> say they don\u2019t get the recommended seven to nine hours a night. Some of the major causes: Stress, anxiety and a culture that experts say is about productivity, not rest.</p><p>\u201cYou need to understand what your body needs and try your hardest to prioritize that and not just see sleep as kind of what\u2019s left over of the day,\u201d said Molly Atwood, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.</p><p>Don\u2019t fall for online fads or unproven methods to fall asleep and stay asleep. Instead, try these simple tricks recommended by sleep experts.</p><hl2>CREATE A BUFFER ZONE</hl2><p>Work-related stress is inevitable, and it can be hard to disconnect. Try creating a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d between the end of your work day and your bedtime.</p><p>Experts suggest leaving career work and daily responsibilities alone about an hour before bed. Don\u2019t check email, pay bills, do chores or scroll endlessly through social media. Instead, create a routine where you relax with a book, indulge in a hobby or spend time with loved ones.</p><p>\u201cIt goes back to the core value of mindfulness,\u201d said Dr. Annise Wilson, an assistant professor of neurology and medicine at Baylor University. \u201cAnything that helps to center you and just helps you focus and release a lot of that tension from the day will then help promote sleep.\u201d</p><hl2>WATCH WHAT YOU EAT</hl2><p>Eating a large meal right before bedtime can disrupt your sleep, so try to grub in the early evening hours.</p><p>\u201cI would say that eating a large meal is impactful simply because it\u2019s like giving your body a really large job to do right before sleep at a time when things are supposed to be shutting down,\u201d Atwood said.</p><p>But don\u2019t go to bed super-hungry, either. Try snacks with protein or healthy fats, like cheese, almonds or peanut butter on whole grain bread.</p><hl2>AVOID CAFFEINE AND ALCOHOL</hl2><p>Having a nightcap or post-dinner espresso might feel relaxing, but it could lead to a long night.</p><p>While alcohol can help you fall asleep initially, it can disrupt your sleep cycle, reducing the quality of sleep and increasing the chances you'll wake up more often in the middle of the night.</p><p>Caffeine is a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9541543/\">stimulant that blocks adenosine</a>, a chemical that contributes to the feeling of sleepiness \u2014 and it can take your body up to 10 hours to clear caffeine.</p><p>For these reasons, experts suggest finishing up your caffeinated or boozy beverages several hours before bed.</p><hl2>LIMIT TECHNOLOGY</hl2><p>Light from phones and computer screens can <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/daylight-saving-health-heart-attack-stroke-06088a66e5e7a86e9df4843742377d89\">disrupt the circadian rhythm</a> \u2013 or the internal clock that naturally wakes us up \u2013 by suppressing melatonin, which assists with sleep.</p><p>But you\u2019ll need self-discipline to stop streaming or scrolling, said Dr. Dianne Augelli, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine.</p><p>\u201cTikTok doesn\u2019t want you to stop,\u201d Augelli said. \u201cOnly you can stop you, so you have to learn to put that stuff away.\u201d</p><hl2>TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR</hl2><p>If nothing\u2019s working and you\u2019ve struggled to get a good night\u2019s sleep for more than a month, experts say it\u2019s time to go to a doctor. This is especially true if your sleepless nights are interfering with your work performance or your mood.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how much relaxation you do. At a certain point, it\u2019s not going to be effective if there\u2019s a significant amount of stress,\u201d Atwood said. \u201c... It might involve some problem-solving to figure that out.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>In a story published April 23, 2024, about sleep tips, The Associated Press erroneously reported the name of an academic medical institution. It is Weill Cornell Medicine, not Weill Cornell Medical College.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
