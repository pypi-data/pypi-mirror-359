The company said Monday after markets closed that it sees no signs that doctor charts or full medical histories were released after the attack.

The company also is offering free credit monitoring and identity theft protection for people affected by the attack.",

But it may take several months of analysis before UnitedHealth can identify and notify people who were affected.</p><p>UnitedHealth did say that some screen shots containing protected health information or personally identifiable information were posted for about a week online on the dark web, which standard browsers can\u2019t access.</p><p>The company is still monitoring the internet and dark web and said there has been no addition file publication. It has started <a href=\"https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/ns/health-data-breach.html\">a website</a> to answer questions and a call center. But the company said it won\u2019t be able to offer specifics on the impact to individual data.</p><p>The company also is offering free credit monitoring and identity theft protection for people affected by the attack.</p><p>UnitedHealth bought Change Healthcare in a roughly $8 billion deal <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/technology-health-business-minnesota-us-department-of-justice-55f01b05097e6e57716d6263275a5e3d\">that closed in 2022</a> after surviving a challenge from federal regulators.

It has been focused first on restoring those that affect patient access to care or medication.</p><p>The company said both pharmacy services and medical claims were back to near normal levels. It said payment process was back to about 86% of pre-attack levels.</p><p>UnitedHealth said last week when it reported <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/unitedhealth-change-cyberattack-first-quarter-076a2bcbf0db3b5e6c4ffa27589c3692\">first-quarter results</a> that the company has provided more than $6 billion in advance funding and interest-free loans to health care providers affected by the attack.</p><p>UnitedHealth took an $872 million hit from from the cyberattack in the first quarter, and company officials said that could grow beyond $1.5 billion for the year.</p><p>Minnetonka, Minnesota-based UnitedHealth Group Inc. runs one of the nation\u2019s largest health insurers. It also runs one of the nation\u2019s largest pharmacy benefits management businesses, provides care and offers technology services.</p><p>Company slipped nearly $3 to $488.36 in midday trading Tuesday while broader indexes climbed.</p>",

It details the impact on healthcare services, including disruptions in payment and claims processing, and the measures taken by UnitedHealth to mitigate the effects, such as offering free credit monitoring and identity theft protection. The document also mentions the involvement of federal civil rights investigators and the financial impact on UnitedHealth. Given that the document extensively covers issues related to health information security, healthcare service disruptions, and the broader implications for the healthcare system, it is highly relevant to the topic of Health."
