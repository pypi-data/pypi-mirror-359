Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital filed the lawsuit against Paxton\u2019s office in December in response to the Republican appearing to go beyond state borders to investigate transgender health care. Paxton, a staunch conservative who has helped drive GOP efforts that target the rights of trans people, sent similar letters to Texas hospitals last year.",

Paxton, a staunch conservative who has helped drive GOP efforts that target the rights of trans people, sent <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/texas-transgender-hospital-investigation-greg-abbott-dce466dcaa7be541c009a2fdc0b4a286\">similar letters to Texas hospitals</a> last year.</p><p>The Seattle hospital said in a statement that it had \u201csuccessfully fought\u201d the \u201coverreaching demands to obtain confidential patient information.\u201d A judge in Austin dismissed the lawsuit Friday, saying the parties had settled their dispute.</p><p>Texas is among states that have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-gender-affirming-care-ban-55773f9fa1e3decd9bc77990ad9af61d\">enacted laws restricting or banning</a> gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors.</p><p>The hospital's lawsuit included a copy of the letter from Paxton\u2019s office, which among other requests asked the hospital to produce records identifying medication given to children who live in Texas; the number of Texas children who received treatment; and documents that identified the \u201cstandard protocol or guidance\u201d used for treatment.</p><p>As part of the settlement, according to court records, the parties agreed that Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital would withdraw its registration to transact business in Texas. But a hospital spokesperson said in a statement that they don't operate health care facilities or provide gender-affirming care in Texas.</p><p>In court records, the hospital had previously stated that it had a \u201climited number\u201d of people who work remotely and live in Texas but that none were involved in gender-affirming care. It also said it did not advertise its services in Texas.</p><p>\u201cWhen we merely began asking questions, they decided to leave the State of Texas and forfeit the opportunity to do business here,\" Paxton said in a news release Monday. He said Texas will \u201cvigorously protect\u201d children from gender-affirming treatment that he called \u201cdamaging.\u201d</p><p>The Texas law prevents transgender minors from accessing hormone therapies, puberty blockers and transition surgeries, even though medical experts say such surgical procedures are rarely performed on children.</p><p>In Washington, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/washington-transgender-health-care-minors-parents-296005ba7c084db94e241283067d2dff\">Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee</a> has signed <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/washington-minors-shelter-law-faa73cb08aad4b040d9c32e90ab6f8c0\">a law</a> that aims to protects minors seeking gender-affirming care there, part of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-gender-affirming-health-care-bcc6ef34aa2fee923e79288fd0f1b56f\">a wave of legislation in Democratic-led states</a> intended to give refuge to those seeking gender-affirming treatment.</p>",
