The president has long denied that fentanyl is produced in Mexico, saying that Mexican cartels only press it into pills or add finishing touches. But the head of Mexico's Criminal Investigation Agency says \u201cMexico has been the champion of methamphetamine production, and now fentanyl\u201d since the 1990s. Experts agree that cartels in Mexico use precursor chemicals from China and India to make the synthetic opioid and smuggle it into the United States, where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually.",

Those clandestine, rural production sites were often bare-bones, improvised labs covered with tree branches and tarpaulins.</p><p>Now, the meth trade has become so lucrative and so sophisticated that Mexican meth is exported as far away as Hong Kong or Australia, and the cartels have found ways to avoid detection of their drug money.</p><p>\u201cThe business models have become very innovative, or as old and antiquated as barter; \u2018I\u2019ll trade you precursor chemicals for meth,' to avoid leaving a money trail,\u201d Gallo said.</p><p>There is little question that drug production goes on at a huge scale in Mexico.</p><p>In February, Mexico's Navy seized over 45 tons of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-meth-mezcal-australia-82035d84c5c23c70b0b8eeb9d38a16b9\">methamphetamine</a> at the biggest drug lab found during the current administration. The lab was in Quiriego, a township in a remote part of the northern border state of Sonora.</p><p>The 91,000 pounds (41,310 kilograms) of meth found there was more than half of the 162,000 pounds of the drug Mexico has seized so far this year.</p><p>Fentanyl production is also huge, though because it is a more potent drug, the volume is smaller.</p><p>A year ago, soldiers seized more than <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/opioids-mexico-city-caribbean-health-035c9d69b2f71bca5ee4381fd6d2207d\">a half-million fentanyl pills</a> in Culiacan in what the army at the time described as the largest synthetic drug lab found to date.</p><p>Soldiers found almost 630,000 pills that appeared to contain fentanyl, the army said. They also reported seizing 282 pounds (128 kilograms) of powdered fentanyl and about 220 pounds (100 kilograms) of suspected methamphetamine.</p><p>L\u00f3pez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1 2018, also claims that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-fentanyl-epidemic-overdoses-26f735a54ee0ba075c394ce85aef03d0\">Mexicans are culturally immune to drug addiction</a>.</p>",
