Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers have announced legislation aimed at helping Arizonans access abortions after the Arizona Supreme Court allowed a near total-ban to move forward. The bill would allow Arizona doctors to temporarily provide abortion care to Arizona patients who travel to California. Newsom said Wednesday that lawmakers will move swiftly to pass the California bill. Newsom has defended abortion access outside of California, which has endeared him to the Democratic Party's core constituencies. He has become a top surrogate in President Joe Biden's reelection campaign.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Arizona doctors could give their patients abortions in California under a proposal announced Wednesday by Gov. Gavin Newsom to circumvent a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/arizona-abortion-ban-what-to-know-797a4bbbc738497fe2284d6870c5be24\">ban on nearly all abortions</a> in the neighboring state.</p><p>It would apply only to doctors licensed in good standing in Arizona and their patients, and last only through the end of November. Arizona's 1864 law banning all abortions except if the woman's life is in jeopardy would take effect June 8, and Newsom said protecting access to abortions is \u201cjust about basic decency\u201d and \u201crespect for women and girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis Arizona law is the first border-state law that will directly impact the state of California,\u201d the Democratic governor said. \u201cRather than just acknowledging that fate and future, we're trying to get ahead of this law.\u201d</p><p>Newsom joined the California Legislative Women's Caucus and advocates to announce the proposal. Lawmakers called the Arizona law \u201cdraconian\u201d and said California had an obligation to get involved. The bill would need to pass by a two-thirds vote in each house of the Legislature before reaching Newsom\u2019s desk. After he signs it, it would go into effect immediately.</p><p>Dr. Tanya Spirtos, a gynecologist and president of the California Medical Association, said it is unfortunate that Arizona abortion patients will have to travel out of state, but she\u2019s proud to see California step in to assist them.</p><p>\u201cAll personal medical decisions, including those around abortion, should be made by patients in consultation with their health care providers,\u201d Spirtos said. \u201cBy banning virtually all abortions in the state, the ruling will put physicians in harm's way for simply providing often lifesaving medical care to their patients.\u201d</p><p>The Arizona Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this month for the near-total ban to move forward. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/arizona-abortion-restrictions-1864-9c68866d69dca38c728dd27b80592e8f\">Fifteen states</a> have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy, though Arizona's Legislature is expected to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/arizona-abortion-1864-ban-repeal-lawmakers-84b0cd9a8c44ddaefed2c45e9eff1c79\">repeal the 160-year-old law</a>, setting the state up for a 15-week limit. California law generally allows the procedure up to the point of fetal viability, which is around 24 weeks.</p><p>About 11,500 abortions were reported in Arizona in 2022, down from nearly 14,000 in the previous year, according to a report from the Arizona Department of Health Services.</p><p>Democratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs\u2019 office declined to comment on the California bill.</p><p>Newsom should focus on \u201cvery real problems\u201d in his own state, said Arizona House Speaker Ben Toma, a Republican who voted against repealing the near-total ban.</p><p>Arizona state Sen. Eva Burch, a Democrat, said the California proposal is \u201ca step in the right direction,\u201d but she hopes it is not necessary and that Arizona repeals the ban. Burch has had two abortions to terminate nonviable pregnancies.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unreasonable for us to expect patients to have to travel out of state for this kind of care,\u201d Burch said. \u201cIn circumstances like mine, where I was having a failed miscarriage, a stalled miscarriage, traveling wouldn\u2019t be appropriate.\u201d</p><p>While abortion access in California has never been under serious threat, Newsom \u2014 widely seen as a potential presidential candidate beyond 2024 \u2014 has made defending that access a priority of his administration.</p><p>Newsom pushed for abortion access to be enshrined in the California Constitution. He <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-us-supreme-court-california-gavin-newsom-729c1df436b5efa69d1cbff438f5905c\">approved $20 million</a> of taxpayer money to help pay for women in other states to come to California for abortions, and he signed <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-us-supreme-court-health-california-df6dd40a7e2af65a1c6a4042e4ffa485\">dozens of laws</a> aimed at making it harder for other states to investigate women who do so, including banning social media companies from <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/california-abortion-pill-gavin-newsom-b7e392be628411230319215d7c010f21\">complying with subpoenas</a> or warrants.</p><p>In 2022, months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v.
