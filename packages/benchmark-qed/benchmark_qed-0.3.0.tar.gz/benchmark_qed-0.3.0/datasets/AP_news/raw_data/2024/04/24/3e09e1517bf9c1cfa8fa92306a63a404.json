The GOP-controlled House on Wednesday voted 106-48 to send the proposal to Republican Gov. Mike Parson. Parson's spokesman didn't immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment Wednesday. But he is expected to sign the bill. Republicans have tried for years to block Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood clinics in Missouri. Defunding efforts have been thwarted in the courts. Abortions are not covered by Medicaid, and almost all abortions are illegal in Missouri. But abortion opponents say Planned Parenthood should not receive any public funding because clinics in other states provide abortions.",

But abortion opponents say Planned Parenthood should not receive any public funding because clinics in other states provide abortions.</p><p>\u201cMy rhetorical question is: Is Planned Parenthood sending monies from our state budget to other states to allow for women to have an abortion?\u201d Republican Rep. Brian Seitz asked during Wednesday debate on the House floor. \"Abortion is murder.\u201d</p><p>House Democratic Minority Leader Crystal Quade in a statement described the bill as \"an act of petty vengeance by Republicans against one of largest providers of women\u2019s health care in Missouri.\u201d</p><p>Planned Parenthood cautioned that other reproductive health care providers that serve Medicaid patients in Missouri do not have the capacity to take on all of Planned Parenthood's patients.</p><p>\u201cExperts are clear: there are not enough other providers in the health care safety-net system to absorb Planned Parenthood\u2019s patients,\u201d the region\u2019s Planned Parenthood said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cAt Planned Parenthood, we\u2019ll continue to do everything we can to continue serving our patients \u2014 no matter what.\u201d</p><p>Few states \u2014 Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas, according to Planned Parenthood \u2014 have successfully blocked Medicaid funding for the organization.</p><p>A February state <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-medicaid-planned-parenthood-5e343d00de4cc4b3e3a7bcbe5f56d2d6\">Supreme Court ruling</a> found that Missouri lawmakers\u2019 latest attempt at defunding Planned Parenthood was unconstitutional.</p><p>While past efforts to kick Planned Parenthood off Missouri\u2019s Medicaid program have been struck down by courts, this year, GOP lawmakers are taking another approach and passing the ban as a policy bill in hopes of avoiding another legal showdown.</p><p>Some House Democrats predicted the latest defunding bill likely will be fruitless, too. They pointed to a pending <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/missouri-abortion-campaign-fundraising-election-740fd1267ab84d5e2a4cf6ebe5a56b71\">constitutional amendment</a> that could go before Missouri voters this fall and would restore abortion rights in the state.</p><p>The abortion-rights campaign needs to collect at least 172,000 voter signatures by May 5 to get on the ballot.</p><p>A spokesperson for Gov. Mike Parson on Wednesday did not immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment on whether the Republican intends to sign the latest Planned Parenthood defunding bill. But his support is expected.</p>",
