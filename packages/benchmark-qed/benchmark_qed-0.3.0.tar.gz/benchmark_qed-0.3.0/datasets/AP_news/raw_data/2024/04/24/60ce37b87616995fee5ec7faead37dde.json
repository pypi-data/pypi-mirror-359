They stressed that such remnants pose no known risk to people or <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-h5n1-food-raw-milk-dairy-9d3a579b9bdb6f4d879b14b153174102\">the milk supply</a>.</p><p>\u201cThe risk to humans remains low,\u201d said Dawn O'Connell of the federal Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response.</p><p>The new order, which goes into effect Monday, requires every lactating cow to be tested and post a negative result before moving to a new state. It will help the agency understand how the virus is spreading, said Michael Watson, an administrator with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.</p><p>\u201cWe believe we can do tens of thousands of tests a day,\u201d he told reporters.</p><p>Until now, testing had been done voluntarily and only in cows with symptoms.</p><p>Avian influenza was first detected <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-dairy-cattle-usda-kansas-texas-c3040bb31a9a8293717d47362f006902\">in dairy cows</a> in March and has been found in nearly three dozen herds in eight states, according to USDA.</p><p>It's an escalation of an ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza spread by wild birds. Since the start of the outbreak, more than 90 million birds in U.S. commercial flocks have either died from the virus or been killed to try to prevent spread.</p><p>Two people in the U.S. \u2014 both farmworkers \u2014 <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-texas-cows-355f1e288e72df8b81b0e2efd8b3ae2f\">have been infected</a> with bird flu since the outbreak began. Health officials said 23 people have been tested for bird flu to date and 44 people exposed to infected animals are being monitored.</p><p>Officials said that samples from a cow in Kansas showed that the virus could be adapting to more animals and they detected H5N1 virus in the lung tissue of a dairy cow that had been culled and sent to slaughter.</p><p>So far, officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have seen no signs that the virus is changing to be more transmissible to people.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

It includes information about the detection of the virus in milk samples, the low risk to humans, and the spread of the virus among dairy cows. The document also mentions the impact on human health, including the infection of farmworkers and monitoring of exposed individuals.
