Experts say people can manage most symptoms by using over-the-counter medicines and knowing pollen levels. But if that doesn\u2019t work, experts suggest seeing a doctor who can determine what specific pollen you\u2019re allergic to. More than 80 million Americans suffer from seasonal allergies and experts say conditions are getting more extreme. Climate change is leading trees and grasses to pollinate longer and more intensely.",

Earlier in the spring, tree pollen is the main culprit. After that grasses pollinate, followed by weeds in the late summer and early fall.</p><p>Some of the most common tree pollens that cause allergies include birch, cedar, cottonwood, maple, elm, oak and walnut, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. Grasses that cause symptoms include Bermuda, Johnson, rye and Kentucky bluegrass.</p><hl2>TRACK POLLEN LEVELS, THEN PLAN YOUR DAY</hl2><p>The best and first step to controlling allergies is avoiding exposure. That\u2019s easier said than done when it's nice out.</p><p>Start with keeping your windows closed at home and in the car, avoiding going out when pollen counts are highest and changing clothes when you get home. The same masks that got us through the pandemic can protect you from allergies \u2014 though they won't help with eye symptoms.</p><p>Pollen trackers can help with planning. The American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology tracks levels through a network of counting stations across the U.S. Counts are available <a href=\"https://pollen.aaaai.org/#/\">at its website and via email</a>.</p><hl2>HOW TO RELIEVE ALLERGY SYMPTOMS</hl2><p>You can't fight an enemy you don't know.</p><p>Since many Americans are allergic to several things at once, the first thing to figure out is what specifically you\u2019re allergic to, said Dr. Nana Mireku, <a href=\"https://texasallergymd.com/meet-nana-mireku-md/\">an allergist</a> in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.</p><p>Over-the-counter nasal sprays can help relieve symptoms, but they take a while to kick in, so it\u2019s best to start them in early in the season, said Dr. Rachna Shah, an allergist and director of the <a href=\"https://www.loyolamedicine.org/find-a-condition-or-service/allergy-count\">Loyola Medicine Allergy Count</a>.</p><p>Antihistamines are another option. Shah said she\u2019s seen some patients benefit from switching to a similar brand if one stops working, but said that there isn\u2019t much broader data to back the recommendation.</p><p>For young children and people who have to take many different allergy medications, immunotherapies in the form of shots and oral drops can help desensitize the immune system to allergens, treating symptoms at their root.</p><hl2>WHERE ARE POLLEN LEVELS THE WORST?</hl2><p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America issues <a href=\"https://aafa.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/aafa-2024-allergy-capitals-report.pdf\">an annual ranking</a> of the most challenging cities to live in if you have allergies, based on over-the-counter medicine use, pollen counts and the number of available allergy specialists. This year, the top five were Wichita, Kansas; Virginia Beach, Virginia; Greenville, South Carolina; Dallas; and Oklahoma City.</p><hl2>IS ALLERGY SEASON CHANGING?</hl2><p>If you've been thinking it started earlier and seems longer this year, you're on to something.</p><p>Shah usually starts looking at pollen counts in the Chicago area in April. But this year, she peeked at her data in mid-February, and tree pollen was already at a \u201cmoderate\u201d level.</p><p>\u201cThis season has been so nuts,\u201d she said. \u201cGranted, it was a pretty mild winter, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be so early.\u201d</p><p>Shah said she believes this season will be longer than other years, assuming the weather remains warm.</p><p>Experts say climate change has led to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-science-business-health-united-states-f45d7a1ceb97703ce3987fc091c2e8a9\">longer and more intense allergy seasons</a>.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
