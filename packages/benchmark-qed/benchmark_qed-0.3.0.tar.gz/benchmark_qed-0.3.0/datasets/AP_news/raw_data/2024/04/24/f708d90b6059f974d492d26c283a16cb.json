Doctors at NYU Langone Health say 54-year-old Lisa Pisano is recovering well. She is only the second patient ever to receive a pig kidney. The first, a man transplanted last month in Boston, also is faring well. Pisano was far sicker, suffering a combination of heart and kidney failure. It's the latest in a string of attempts to make animal-to-human organ transplants a reality.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Doctors have transplanted a pig kidney into a New Jersey woman who was near death, part of a dramatic pair of surgeries that also stabilized her failing heart.</p><p>Lisa Pisano\u2019s combination of heart and kidney failure left her too sick to qualify for a traditional transplant, and out of options. Then doctors at NYU Langone Health devised a novel one-two punch: Implant a mechanical pump to keep her heart beating and days later transplant a kidney from a genetically modified pig.</p><p>Pisano is recovering well, the NYU team announced Wednesday. She\u2019s only the second patient ever to receive a pig kidney -- following a landmark transplant <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pig-kidney-transplant-boston-c7fb54b1b1f1ece3b41b85f105fe4b98\">last month at Massachusetts General Hospital</a> \u2013 and the latest in a string of attempts to make animal-to-human transplantation a reality.</p><p>This week, the 54-year-old grasped a walker and took her first few steps.</p><p>\u201cI was at the end of my rope,\u201d Pisano told The Associated Press. \u201cI just took a chance. And you know, worst case scenario, if it didn\u2019t work for me, it might have worked for someone else and it could have helped the next person.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of NYU Langone Transplant Institute, recounted cheers in the operating room as the organ immediately started making urine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been transformative,\" Montgomery said of the experiment's early results.</p><p>But \"we\u2019re not off the hook yet,\u201d cautioned Dr. Nader Moazami, the NYU cardiac surgeon who implanted the heart pump.</p><p>\u201cWith this surgery I get to see my wife smile again,\u201d Pisano's husband Todd said Wednesday.</p><p>Other transplant experts are closely watching how the patient fares.</p><p>\u201cI have to congratulate them,\" said Dr. Tatsuo Kawai of Mass General, who noted that his own pig kidney patient was healthier overall going into his operation than NYU's patient. \u201cWhen the heart function is bad, it\u2019s really difficult to do a kidney transplant.\u201d</p><hl2>THE PIG ORGAN QUEST</hl2><p>More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant waiting list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting. In hopes of filling the shortage of donated organs, several biotech companies are genetically modifying pigs so their organs are more humanlike, less likely to be destroyed by people's immune system.</p><p>NYU and other research teams have temporarily transplanted pig kidneys and hearts <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pig-kidney-transplant-xenotransplant-83dfb5e6d022ca72039a821cc6bc00ef\">into brain-dead bodies, with promising results</a>. Then the University of Maryland transplanted pig hearts into two men who were out of other options, and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pig-heart-transplant-xenotransplant-maryland-22a3bb89b960ec3da49e7cf2432c3947\">both died within months</a>.</p><p>Mass General\u2019s pig kidney transplant last month raised new hopes. Kawai said Richard \u201cRick\u201d Slayman experienced an early rejection scare but bounced back enough to go home earlier this month and still is faring well five weeks post-transplant. A recent biopsy showed no further problems.</p><hl2>A COMPLEX CASE AT NYU</hl2><p>Pisano is the first woman to receive a pig organ \u2014 and unlike with prior xenotransplant experiments, both her heart and kidneys had failed. She went into cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated before the experimental surgeries. She'd gotten too weak to even play with her grandchildren. \u201cI was miserable,\u201d the Cookstown, New Jersey, woman said.</p><p>A failed heart made her ineligible for a traditional kidney transplant. But while on dialysis, she didn't qualify for a heart pump, called a left ventricular assist device or LVAD, either.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like being in a maze and you can\u2019t find a way out,\u201d Montgomery explained \u2014 until the surgeons decided to pair a heart pump with a pig kidney.</p><hl2>TWO SURGERIES IN EIGHT DAYS</hl2><p>With emergency permission from the Food and Drug Administration, Montgomery chose an organ from a pig genetically engineered by United Therapeutics Corp. so its cells don't produce a particular sugar that\u2019s foreign to the human body and triggers immediate organ rejection.</p><p>Plus a tweak: The donor pig\u2019s thymus gland, which trains the immune system, was attached to the donated kidney in hopes that it would help Pisano's body tolerate the new organ.</p><p>Surgeons implanted the LVAD to power Pisano's heart on April 4, and transplanted the pig kidney on April 12. There's no way to predict her long-term outcome but she\u2019s shown no sign of organ rejection so far, Montgomery said. And in adjusting the LVAD to work with her new kidney, Moazami said doctors already have learned lessons that could help future care of heart-and-kidney patients.</p><p>Special \u201ccompassionate use\u201d experiments teach doctors a lot but it will take rigorous studies to prove if xenotransplants really work. What happens with Pisano and Mass General's kidney recipient will undoubtedly influence FDA's decision to allow such trials. United Therapeutics said it hopes to begin one next year.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
