    "description_summary": "A new report says nearly 282 million people in 59 countries suffered from acute hunger in 2023, with war-torn Gaza hosting the largest number of people facing famine. The Global Report on Food Crises released Wednesday said the increase of 24 million people experiencing an acute lack of food from 2022 was due to the sharp deterioration in food security, especially in the Gaza Strip and Sudan, and the expanded number of nations with food crises that are monitored. According to the report, more than 705,000 people in five countries were at the worst catastrophic level of food insecurity. M\u00e1ximo Torero, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s chief economist, said over 80% of those facing imminent famine \u2014 577,000 people \u2014 were in Gaza.",

            "reason": "The document discusses acute hunger and famine affecting millions of people globally, with a focus on specific regions like Gaza, Sudan, and others. While the primary focus is on food security and hunger, these issues are closely related to health, as malnutrition and starvation have direct and severe impacts on physical health. The document also mentions the need for addressing underlying causes of malnutrition, which ties into broader health concerns. However, the document does not delve deeply into specific health conditions or healthcare systems, which would be more directly relevant to the topic of health."
