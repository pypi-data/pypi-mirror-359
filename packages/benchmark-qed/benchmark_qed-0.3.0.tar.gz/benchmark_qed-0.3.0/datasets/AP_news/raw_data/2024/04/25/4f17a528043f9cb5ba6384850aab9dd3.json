A law set to go into effect later this year requires food businesses with 15 storefronts or more to post a warning icon next to menu items containing at least 50 grams of added sugar. The city\u2019s health department posted its proposed rule language last week. A public hearing is scheduled for late May. City officials and Democratic Mayor Eric Adams approved the law last year. Critics of such regulations have long argued that officials are turning the city into a \u201cnanny state.\u201d",

Eating too many added sugars can contribute to type 2 diabetes and weight gain.\u201d</p><p>The city's health department posted its <a href=\"https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/notice/2024/noi-ch39-0422.pdf\">proposed rule language</a> last week and set a public hearing for late May. City officials and Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, approved the law last year. The rule is scheduled to go into effect June 19 for prepackaged food items and Dec. 1 for other items.</p><p>Asked about the policy in a 1010 WINS radio interview Thursday, Adams said, \u201cWe have an obligation and responsibility as a city, not only to react to the healthcare crisis, but to be proactive to prevent some of the healthcare issues.
