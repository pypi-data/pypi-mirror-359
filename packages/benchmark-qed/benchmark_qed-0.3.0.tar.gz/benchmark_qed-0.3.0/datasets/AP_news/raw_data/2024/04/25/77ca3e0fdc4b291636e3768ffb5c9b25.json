    "description_summary": "It's now illegal to sell weight-loss and muscle-building supplements to minors in New York. The first-in-the-nation law went into effect this week. Experts say loose federal regulation of dietary supplements has resulted in these products sometimes including unapproved ingredients, like steroids, putting kids at risk. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration oversees the market, but it doesn\u2019t test products before they\u2019re sold. New York\u2019s law allows the state to fine businesses who sell kids the diet pills. Dhriti Rathod, a 17-year-old model, says she's in favor of the measure since kids may not know of the dangers.",

(AP) \u2014 It\u2019s now illegal to sell <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mounjaro-ozempic-wegovy-weight-loss-obesity-53d02d95d3e6d4e5e5905a88142a701d\">weight-loss</a> and muscle-building supplements to minors in New York, under a first-in-the-nation law that went into effect this week.</p><p>Experts say loose federal regulation of dietary supplements has resulted in these products sometimes including unapproved ingredients, like steroids and heavy metals, putting kids at risk. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration oversees the market, but it doesn\u2019t test products before they\u2019re sold.</p><p>\u201cThe law that we crafted reflects the lack of regulation from the FDA and the lack of regulation in the industry,\u201d said Jensen Jose, a regulatory counsel member with the Center for Science in the Public Interest who worked on the legislation.</p><p>State lawmakers in Massachusetts are considering a similar measure. California\u2019s state house previously passed a ban on selling weight-loss supplements to minors that was vetoed by the governor, but lawmakers there are considering a new version. A Colorado law ending the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/eating-disorder-laws-colorado-2acc019f54d45938cf208de68e506845\">sale of diet pills to minors</a> goes into effect in July.</p><p>New York\u2019s law allows the state to fine businesses who sell kids diet pills or supplements that promote themselves as helping build muscle or burn fat. Protein supplements and shakes are exempt, unless they contain another weight-loss or muscle-building ingredient.</p><p>While specific products aren\u2019t banned, the law states judges enforcing the measure could consider the inclusion of ingredients including creatine, green tea extract and raspberry ketone.</p><p>The bill\u2019s creators point to studies that have found some supplements secretly tainted with anabolic steroids and banned stimulants. That makes the products especially harmful for children, who are still growing, said Theresa Gentile, a registered nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.</p><p>At Natural Body Astoria, a vitamin and supplement store in Queens, worker Nick Kubler said the company was already self-policing before the law came in this week.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never really sold anything like that to children anyway, but we are definitely more aware now,\u201d Kubler said.</p><p>Dhriti Rathod, a 17-year-old model and student at the New York Institute of Technology, said she\u2019s in favor of the restrictions.</p><p>\u201cPeople my age, they don\u2019t look into this kind of stuff, they do it based on what they see online,\" Rathod said. \u201cThey see people have been using it, so they go right into it and start using it, but they don\u2019t know the dangers.\u201d</p><p>But the new regulation has been met with pushback from the industry at large, with some retailers saying the definition of what can and can\u2019t be sold to kids is unclear.</p><p>\u201cThe actual definition of what is illegal to sell to a minor is incredibly vague,\u201d said Lee Wright, chief executive officer for nationwide chain The Vitamin Shoppe.</p><p>He says the company spent an \u201cinordinate amount of time\u201d to figure out how to implement the new rules. Its computer systems now show a pop-up screen when the kind of products targeted by the law are being sold.</p><p>The law was also challenged by at least two lawsuits from industry groups that argued it is too vague and that regulation is the FDA\u2019s responsibility.</p><p>In one of those suits, a Manhattan federal judge last Friday denied a motion by the Council for Responsible Nutrition to stop the law from taking effect, finding it was \u201cuncompromisingly clear\u201d and saying the organization\u2019s fears of potential fines and loss of income \u201cpale in comparison\u201d to the state\u2019s goal of protecting youth from \u201cunfettered access to dietary supplements.\u201d</p><p>Spokespeople for the FDA did not respond to email messages requesting comment.</p><p>State Sen. Shelley Mayer, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation, said implementation shouldn\u2019t be that hard for businesses, since some of them already sort their supplements in categories for weight loss or muscle building.</p><p>It\u2019s unclear how large online retailers like Amazon will ensure they aren\u2019t shipping the supplements to minors in the Empire State. The company did not respond to a request for comment. Certain products on The Vitamin Shoppe\u2019s online store note that buyers in New York will need to present an ID on delivery.</p><p>Maxim Abramciuc, an 18-year-old who has used muscle-building supplements in the past, said while he understands the restriction, he doesn't fully agree with it.</p><p>\u201cThey should be able to buy some of these products,\" he said while browsing through a vitamin and supplement shop in Albany. \"If it has little side effects, why shouldn't children take it?\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Maysoon Khan is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative. <a href=\"https://www.reportforamerica.org/\">Report for America</a> is a nonprofit national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on undercovered issues.</p>",
