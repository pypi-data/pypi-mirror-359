Arkansas and Tennessee filed the lawsuit in federal court on Thursday and called the new rules an illegal interpretation of a 2022 federal law. The lawsuit comes after finalized federal regulations were published last week on how to implement the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. The language means that workers can ask for time off to obtain an abortion and recover from the procedure. The lawsuit argues that the rules go beyond the scope of the law.",

The language means workers can ask for time off to obtain an abortion and recover from the procedure.</p><p>The rules, which the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission adopted on a 3-2 vote along party lines, will go into effect June 18. The lawsuit filed in federal court in Arkansas argues the regulations go beyond the scope of the 2022 law that passed with bipartisan support.</p><p>\u201cThis is yet another attempt by the Biden administration to force through administrative fiat what it cannot get passed through Congress,\u201d Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said in a statement. \u201cUnder this radical interpretation of the PWFA, business owners will face federal lawsuits if they don\u2019t accommodate employees\u2019 abortions, even if those abortions are illegal under state law.\u201d</p><p>An EEOC spokesperson referred questions to the Justice Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>A Better Balance, one of the most vocal advocates for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, called the lawsuit a baseless attack on the law's protections.</p><p>\u201cThis lawsuit represents a bad faith effort to politicize what is a vital protection for the health and economic security of millions of families, and a continuation of the alarming attacks on women\u2019s health and reproductive choice,\u201d Dina Bakst, the group's co-president, said in a statement. \"We are committed to fighting to defend workers\u2019 rights under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.\u201d</p><p>The EEOC has said the new law does not obligate employers or employer-sponsored health plans to cover abortion-related costs, and that the type of accommodation that most likely will be sought under the <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/sites/default/files/2023-05/PWFA%20Infographic-1_508%20FINAL.pdf\">Pregnant Workers Fairness Act</a> regarding an abortion is time off to attend a medical appointment or for recovery, which does not have to be paid.</p><p>The other states joining the lawsuit are Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah and West Virginia.</p><p>___</p><p>This story has been updated to correct that the rules were published Monday, April 15, not this past Monday.
