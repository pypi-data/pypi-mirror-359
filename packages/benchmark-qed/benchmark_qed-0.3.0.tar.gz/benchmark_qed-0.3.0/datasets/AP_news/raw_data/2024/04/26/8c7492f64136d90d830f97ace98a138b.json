    "description_summary": "A proposed ban in Kansas on gender-affirming care for minors also would bar state employees from promoting it or even children\u2019s social transitioning. Teachers and social workers who support LGBTQ+ rights worry that they will be disciplined or fired for helping kids who are exploring their gender identities. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly vetoed the proposed ban, and top Republicans anticipated Friday that the GOP-controlled Legislature will attempt to override her action before lawmakers adjourn for the year Tuesday. Supporters said the ban being singled out now for criticism would ensure that a ban can be enforced. But critics contend that it is so broadly written that it is not clear how it applies.",

    "body_nitf": "<p>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) \u2014 A proposed ban in Kansas on gender-affirming care for minors also would bar state employees from promoting it \u2014 or even children's social transitioning.</p><p>Teachers and social workers who support LGBTQ+ rights worry that they could be disciplined or fired for helping kids who are exploring their gender identities.</p><p>Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-care-abortion-pornography-kansas-7b4141984334258017da842a3542570c\">vetoed the proposed ban,</a> and top Republicans anticipated Friday that the GOP-controlled Legislature will attempt to override her action before lawmakers adjourn for the year Tuesday. Their bill <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/gender-affirming-care-ban-minors-kansas-3e5fb153b6a5ece0f0ab540d9746f97d\">appeared to have</a> the two-thirds majorities needed in both chambers to override a veto when it passed last month, but that could depend on all Republicans being present and none of them switching.</p><p>Supporters of the bill said the provision now being singled out for criticism is designed to ensure that the banned care \u2014 puberty blockers, hormone treatments and surgery \u2014 isn't still promoted with tax dollars or other state resources.</p><p>But compared to the restrictions or bans on gender-affirming care in two dozen other states, the Kansas proposal appears more sweeping because of its broad language against the promotion of social transitioning that applies to state employees \u201cwhose official duties include the care of children,\" LGBTQ+ rights advocates said.</p><p>\u201cThat is not something that we have seen before,\" said Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, an attorney for the LGBTQ+ rights group Lambda Legal. \u201cIt really allows us to look behind the curtain at what is the true motivation behind this bill, which has nothing to do with protecting the health and safety of youth and everything to do with attacking transgender people and erasing transgender identity.\u201d</p><p>About 300,000 youths ages 13 to 17 identify as transgender in the U.S., according to estimates by the Williams Institute, an LGBTQ+ research center at UCLA Law. It estimates that in Kansas, about 2,100 youths in that age group identify as transgender.</p><p>Other provisions of the proposed ban would prevent gender-affirming care from occurring on state property and prohibit groups receiving state funds from advocating medications or surgery to treat a child whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth.</p><p>Brittany Jones, an attorney and policy director for the conservative Kansas Family Voice, said courts have consistently ruled that a state \u201chas the right to direct what is being done with its funds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis does not block any child from socially transitioning, but it cannot be at the behest of a government entity,\u201d she said in an email.</p><p>In statehouses across the U.S., Republicans have promoted restrictions on gender-affirming care by portraying it as experimental and the potential source of long-term medical problems.</p><p>Backers of the Kansas proposal have repeatedly pointed to the National Health Service of England's <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-puberty-blockers-england-uk-5ed81979363470028053423c0a2fa263\">recent decision</a> to stop prescribing puberty blockers as a routine treatment for minors seeking gender transitions.</p><p>\u201cObviously, we believe in our heart of hearts that they shouldn\u2019t be steering students toward that sort of thing, that they should be looking at all alternative counseling and things of that nature,\u201d said state Sen. Mike Thompson, a conservative Kansas City-area Republican.</p><p>Such bans are opposed by major American medical groups, which have firmly endorsed gender-affirming care for minors. At least 200 Kansas medical and mental health professionals signed <a href=\"https://neartail.com/public/112018621399901727788/all/form/1FAIpQLSf1w14R3ppyupWRBiaMbwQT1e4Y8TzLR0Xz0mjXp2o-yRz7lA\">a letter to lawmakers</a> opposing the proposed ban.</p><p>Young transgender Kansas residents have repeatedly said their transitions improved their lives dramatically. Parents of transgender kids have described gender-affirming care as vital to combatting severe depression and suicidal tendencies.</p><p>But as troubling as they and others find the loss of access for kids to gender-affirming care, they have focused in recent weeks on the provision against promoting social transitioning as especially scary to them.</p><p>\u201cI was taught to uplift students and make them know that I will support them 100 percent, no matter who they are,\u201d Riley Long, a transgender special education teacher, said during a news conference in the Kansas City area. \u201cThis bill makes it seem like it is only OK to listen to my cisgender students, and that my transgender students are automatically incorrect.\u201d</p><p>Under the bill, social transitioning includes \u201cthe changing of an individual\u2019s preferred pronouns or manner of dress.\u201d The measure doesn\u2019t spell out what constitutes promoting it.</p><p>The Kansas State Department of Education says public school teachers and administrators aren\u2019t legally considered state employees. However, educators who support transgender rights aren\u2019t confident that they wouldn't fall under the ban \u2014 or that opponents of transgender rights wouldn\u2019t attack their jobs regardless.</p><p>Isaac Johnson, who is completing a social work degree and just finished an internship in Topeka\u2019s public schools, said problems could arise from interactions like one he had with a girl who told him, \u201cI don\u2019t really feel like a girl. I only feel like a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I said back in response is, \u2018Well, what does that mean? What does it mean to be a girl?\u2019 \u201d Johnson, who is transgender, told reporters during a Statehouse news conference Thursday. \u201cMy fear is that, per the law, because I didn\u2019t come out explicitly and say, \u2018No, you\u2019re a girl. You\u2019ll always be a girl,\u2019 that will be seen as promoting social transition.\u201d</p><p>Transgender Kansas residents and parents of transgender kids also believe they have even more cause to be nervous after Republican lawmakers last year overrode Kelly's veto of a measure that ended the state's legal recognition of transgender people's gender identities. The law's most visible consequence has been to keep transgender people from changing their driver's licenses and birth certificates to reflect their gender identities \u2014 something that wasn't the focus of last year's debate.</p><p>Aaron Roberts, the pastor of a United Church of Christ congregation in the Kansas City area, said support from social workers was crucial to his transgender daughter before she joined his family out of foster care. She is now a college student.</p><p>\u201cAll the support that she got from those wonderful social workers who went above and beyond to help her navigate her gender identity \u2014 this bill wipes them out,\" he said. \u201cGone.\u201d</p>",
