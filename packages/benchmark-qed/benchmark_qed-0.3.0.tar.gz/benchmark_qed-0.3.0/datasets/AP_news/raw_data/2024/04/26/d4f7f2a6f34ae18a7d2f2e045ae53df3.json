The comments Tuesday appeared to contradict past statements by President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who has denied any fentanyl is produced in Mexico. The office of Felipe de Jesus Gallo, the head of Mexico\u2019s Criminal Investigation Agency, said in a statement Thursday that \u201che used an inadequate word,\u201d but didn\u2019t specify whether the bad word was \u201cchampion.\u201d The comments drew L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s ire Thursday. The president has long claimed that Mexican cartels only press it into pills or add finishing touches.",

Those clandestine, rural production sites were often bare-bones, improvised labs covered with tree branches and tarpaulins.</p><p>Now, the meth trade has become so lucrative and so sophisticated that Mexican meth is exported as far away as Hong Kong or Australia, and the cartels have found ways to avoid detection of their drug money.</p><p>There is little question that drug production goes on at a huge scale in Mexico.</p><p>In February, Mexico\u2019s Navy seized over 45 tons of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-meth-mezcal-australia-82035d84c5c23c70b0b8eeb9d38a16b9\">methamphetamine</a> at the biggest drug lab found during the current administration. The lab was in Quiriego, a township in a remote part of the northern border state of Sonora.</p><p>The 91,000 pounds (41,310 kilograms) of meth found there was more than half of the 162,000 pounds of the drug Mexico has seized so far this year.</p><p>Fentanyl production is also huge, though because it is a more potent drug, the volume is smaller.</p><p>A year ago, soldiers seized more than <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/opioids-mexico-city-caribbean-health-035c9d69b2f71bca5ee4381fd6d2207d\">a half-million fentanyl pills</a> in Culiacan in what the army at the time described as the largest synthetic drug lab found to date.</p><p>Soldiers found almost 630,000 pills that appeared to contain fentanyl, the army said. They also reported seizing 282 pounds (128 kilograms) of powdered fentanyl and about 220 pounds (100 kilograms) of suspected methamphetamine.</p>",

The document does mention overdose deaths in the U.S. due to fentanyl, but this is not the central theme. Therefore, the document is somewhat relevant to health but not highly focused on it."
