    "description_summary": "An investigation by The Associated Press has found that at least 16 people died in California over a decade following physical encounters with police during which medical personnel also injected them with a powerful sedative. The deaths happened in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, San Diego and cities in Orange and San Bernardino counties. It was impossible for the AP to determine the exact role injections may have played in the deaths, which medical officials typically blame on drug use or other police force. The idea behind sedation is to calm people who are combative so they can be transported to the hospital. Critics say the practice can be too risky.",

Other places with cases included Los Angeles, San Diego and cities in Orange and San Bernardino counties.</p><p>While the use of the drug <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-health-politics-mn-state-wire-us-news-a872ba9aeeba2f5b0624f8af77f928d3\">ketamine</a> has drawn scrutiny in other states, AP\u2019s investigation found that California paramedics almost always used midazolam, better known by its brand name Versed.</p><p>The deaths were among <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/associated-press-investigation-deaths-police-encounters-02881a2bd3fbeb1fc31af9208bb0e310\">more than 1,000 that AP\u2019s investigation documented</a> across the United States of people who died after officers used not their guns, but physical force or weapons such as Tasers that \u2014 like sedatives \u2014 are not meant to kill. Medical officials said police force caused or contributed to about half of all deaths.</p><p>It was impossible for the AP to determine the exact role injections may have played in many of the 94 deaths involving sedation that reporters found nationally during the investigation\u2019s 2012-2021 timeframe. Few of those deaths were attributed to the sedation and authorities rarely investigated whether injections were appropriate, focusing more often on the use of force by police and the other drugs in people\u2019s systems.</p><p>The idea behind the injections is to calm people who are combative, often due to drugs or a psychotic episode, so they can be transported to the hospital. Supporters say sedatives enable rapid treatment while protecting front-line responders from violence. Critics argue that the medications, given without consent, can be too risky to be administered during police encounters.</p><p>California was among the states with the most sedation cases, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/projects/investigation-police-use-of-force/\">according to the investigation</a>, which the AP did in collaboration with FRONTLINE (PBS) and the Howard Centers for Investigative Journalism.</p><p>Midazolam was given in 15 of the 16 California cases, all by paramedics outside of a hospital. The drug can cause respiratory depression, a side effect experts say may be dangerous when mixed with police restraint tactics that restrict breathing \u2014 or with alcohol or certain drugs that a person may already have consumed.</p><p>The 16th case involved a man injected with a similar class of drug, lorazepam, while police restrained him at a hospital in San Diego.</p><p>Two emergency room doctors in San Diego told the AP they have discussed switching to ketamine, which supporters say is safer and works faster than midazolam. But the doctors said negative headlines about ketamine, especially after deaths and misuse in Colorado, stalled that idea.</p><p>AP\u2019s investigation shows that the risks of sedation during behavioral emergencies go beyond any specific drug, said Eric Jaeger, an emergency medical services educator in New Hampshire who has studied the issue and advocates for additional safety measures and training.</p><p>\u201cNow that we have better information, we know that it can present a significant danger regardless of the sedative agent used,\u201d he said.</p><p>Sedatives were often given as treatments for \u201cexcited delirium,\u201d an agitated condition linked to drug use or mental illness that medical groups have disavowed in recent years. California in 2023 became the first state to bar excited delirium as a valid medical diagnosis, including as a cause of death in autopsies.</p><p>___ The Associated Press receives support from the Public Welfare Foundation for reporting focused on criminal justice.

It delves into the use of specific drugs like midazolam and lorazepam, their effects, and the associated risks, particularly in the context of police restraint. While the primary focus is on the intersection of law enforcement and medical intervention, the document provides significant information on the health implications of sedative use, the risks involved, and the medical community's response to these practices. Therefore, it is relevant to the topic of health, though it is not exclusively focused on health issues but rather on a specific aspect of health within a broader investigative context."
