Anti-smoking advocates are upset about the delay, but the decision could avoid angering Black voters ahead of November elections. Biden\u2019s top health official said Friday the administration would take more time to consider feedback on the ban, including from civil rights leaders. The announcement is another setback for the health officials at the Food and Drug Administration. They drafted the ban and predicted it would prevent hundreds of thousands of smoking-related deaths. But White House officials have delayed finalizing the ban several times.",

Most of groups have financial ties to tobacco companies.</p><p>The announcement is another setback for Food and Drug Administration officials, who drafted the ban and predicted it would prevent hundreds of thousands of smoking-related deaths over 40 years. The agency has worked toward banning menthol across <a href=\"https://apnews.com/general-news-6773f62603764a68a2ec27764865ff10\">multiple administrations</a> without ever finalizing a rule.</p><p>\u201cThis decision prioritizes politics over lives, especially Black lives,\u201d said Yolonda Richardson of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, in an emailed statement. \u201cIt is especially disturbing to see the administration parrot the false claims of the tobacco industry about support from the civil rights community.\u201d</p><p>Richardson noted that the ban is supported by groups including the NAACP and the Congressional Black Caucus.</p><p>Previous FDA efforts on menthol have been derailed by tobacco industry pushback or competing political priorities. With both Biden and former President Donald Trump vying for the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/republicans-black-voters-election-trump-biden-5cdcb6cdf042ccf2b506becdaf2fc218\">support of Black voters</a>, the ban's potential impact has been scrutinized by Republicans and Democrats heading into the fall election.</p><p>Anti-smoking advocates have been pushing the FDA to eliminate the flavor since the agency gained authority to regulate certain tobacco ingredients in 2009. Menthol is the only cigarette flavor that wasn\u2019t banned under that law, a carveout negotiated by industry allies in Congress. But the law instructed the FDA to continue studying the issue.</p><p>More than 11% of U.S. adults smoke, with rates roughly even between white and Black people. But about 80% of Black smokers smoke menthol, which the FDA says masks the harshness of smoking, making it easier to start and harder to quit. Also, most teenagers who smoke cigarettes prefer menthols.</p><p>For decades, tobacco companies focused menthol advertising and promotions in Black communities, sponsoring music festivals and neighborhood events. Industry documents released via litigation also show companies viewed menthol cigarettes as a good \u201cstarter product\u201d because they were more palatable to teens.</p><p>The FDA released its draft of the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fda-to-ban-menthol-cigarettes-cigars-04832ac01c3596cbedc4257f460707e8\">proposed ban in 2022</a>. Officials under Biden initially targeted last August to finalize the rule. Late last year, White House officials said they would take until March to review the measure. When that deadline passed last month, several anti-smoking groups filed a lawsuit to force its release.</p><p>\u201cWe are disappointed with the action of the Biden administration, which has caved in to the scare tactics of the tobacco industry,\u201d said Dr. Mark Mitchell of the National Medical Association, an African American physician group that is suing the administration.</p><p>Separately, Rev. Al Sharpton and other civil rights leaders have warned that a menthol ban would create an illegal market for the cigarettes in Black communities and invite more confrontations with police.</p><p>The FDA and health advocates have long rejected such concerns, noting FDA\u2019s enforcement of the rule would only apply to companies that make or sell cigarettes, not to individuals.</p><p>An FDA spokesperson said Friday the agency is still committed to banning menthol cigarettes.</p><p>\u201cAs we\u2019ve made clear, these product standards remain at the top of our priorities,\u201d Jim McKinney said in a statement.</p><p>Smoking can cause cancer, strokes and heart attacks and is blamed for 480,000 deaths each year in the U.S., including 45,000 among Black Americans.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
