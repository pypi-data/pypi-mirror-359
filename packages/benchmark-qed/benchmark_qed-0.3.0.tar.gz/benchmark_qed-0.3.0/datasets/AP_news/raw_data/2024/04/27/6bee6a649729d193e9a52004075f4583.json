The question has been raised ahead of the voting that will likely elect Mexico\u2019s first female president for the term 2024-2030. Out of three candidates, the frontrunner is Claudia Sheinbaum, from the ruling party. Next comes opposition candidate X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez. Neither, though, has shared specific proposals on abortion or LGBTQ+ rights in a country of more than 98 million Catholics. Twelve of Mexico\u2019s 32 states have decriminalized abortion. A few more states allow abortion if the mother\u2019s life is in danger.",

Next comes <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-politics-xochitl-galvez-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador-present-politics-30ed04316ff56de326754d13b8cef1dd\">X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez</a>, representing several opposition parties, one of which is historically conservative.</p><p>The triumph of Sheinbaum or G\u00e1lvez, however, would not guarantee their support for certain gender-related policies.</p><p>In a country of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-election-claudia-sheinbaum-judaism-catholicism-5932fcf5d74c215ae0e08a40eff8a64f\">more than 98 million Catholics</a>, neither of the two leading candidates has shared specific proposals on abortion. Both have suggested equality and protection measures for women amid a wave of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/e5a704308a016fcc12676e358c97f9d5\">violence and femicide</a>.</p><p>Here\u2019s a look at some of the challenges that Mexico\u2019s next president would face regarding abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.</p><hl2>WHAT'S THE CURRENT ABORTION LANDSCAPE?</hl2><p>Twelve of Mexico\u2019s 32 states have decriminalized abortion, most of them in the past five years. One more will join them after its legislature complies with a recent court's ruling, demanding a reform in its penal code.</p><p>A few more states allow abortion if the mother\u2019s life is in danger, and it is legal nationwide if the pregnancy is the result of rape.</p><p>Mexico\u2019s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-abortion-decriminalize-d87f6edbdf68c2e6c8f5700b3afd15de\">Supreme Court ruled in 2023</a> that national <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-legal-abortion-access-activists-470863cf5a9101b7ffb12bd323e3466b\">laws prohibiting abortions are unconstitutional</a> and violate women\u2019s rights. The ruling, which extended Latin America\u2019s trend of widening abortion access, happened a year after the U.S. Supreme Court went in the opposite direction, overturning the 1973 ruling that established a nationwide right to abortion.</p><p>Although the Mexican ruling orders the removal of abortion from the federal penal code and requires federal health institutions to offer the procedure to anyone who requests it, further state-by-state legal work is pending to remove all penalties.</p><p>In most of the states where it has been decriminalized, abortion-rights activists say <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-religion-mexico-caribbean-cfefab28982792ba752b580e6031b298\">they face persistent challenges</a> in trying to make abortion safe, accessible and government-funded.</p><p>To address restrictions and bans, dozens of volunteers \u2014 known as \u201cacompa\u00f1antes\u201d \u2014 <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-pills-bans-mexico-us-border-76352e344ab3bd6e9170288ef5eadf1d\">have developed a nationwide network</a> to share information on self-managed medication abortions following guidelines established by the World Health Organization.</p><hl2>COULD A NEW GOVERNMENT STRIKE DOWN THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ABORTION IN MEXICO?</hl2><p>Whoever wins, the next president would not directly affect abortion legislation, since each state has autonomy over its penal code.</p><p>However, the president could indeed have an impact as a moral authority among the members of his or her party, said Ninde Molina, lawyer at Abortistas MX, an organization specializing in abortion litigation strategies.</p><p>\u201cMuch of the governors\u2019 behavior emulates what the president does,\u201d Molina said.</p><p>She among the activists who worry that neither Sheinbaum nor Galvez have shared specific proposals addressing abortion, LGBTQ+ rights and the protection of migrants.</p><p>\u201cSuch lukewarm proposals send the message that these are not fundamental rights,\u201d Molina said.</p><p>And though she wouldn\u2019t immediately worry about a setback on abortion policy, the scenario would change if L\u00f3pez Obrador or Sheinbaum manage to get the approval of a judiciary reform aiming to replace the current judges with new ones elected by popular vote.</p><p>\u201cThe court is also in danger,\u201d Molina said. \u201cPeople may find this (electing the judges) attractive, but they don\u2019t realize what it entails.\u201d</p><p>If, for example, an abortion case reaches the Supreme Court and its current composition has changed, then a setback could indeed happen, Molina said.</p><hl2>WHAT DO THE CONSERVATIVES THINK?</hl2><p>Isaac Alonso, from Viva M\u00e9xico Movement, which supported <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-elections-eduardo-verastegui-abortion-b5ab9c135e8f1bc3168c2c0b4b65d6af\">right-wing activist Eduardo Ver\u00e1stegui\u2019</a> s presidential aspirations, thinks that neither Sheinbaum nor G\u00e1lvez represent Mexico\u2019s conservative interests.</p><p>In his ranks, he said, no one is in favor of criminalizing women who have abortions. But since they firmly believe that abortion is unjustifiable, they would hope for government policies that encourage births through improvements in the adoption system.</p><p>Rodrigo Iv\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, director of the National Family Front, an anti-abortion group, said the current administration could not be considered an ally. \u201cBefore 2018, abortion had only been approved in Mexico City,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt is very relevant to say how the Supreme Court, under the leadership of Arturo Sald\u00edvar, had an ideological bias,\u201d said Cort\u00e9s about a judge who currently advises Sheinbaum.</p><p>Still, he said, despite who wins the elections, his organization will continue \u201cto take care of the first and fundamental of rights: life.\u201d</p><hl2>WHAT'S NEEDED TO RULE WITH A FEMINIST PERSPECTIVE?</hl2><p>\u201cJust because a woman wins does not guarantee a gender perspective at all,\u201d said Pauline Capdevielle, an academic from the National Autonomous University of Mexico.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, what we are seeing are strategies by conservative sectors to create a fa\u00e7ade of feminism that opposes the feminist tradition.\u201d</p><p>A true change, Capdevielle said, would start by integrating feminists into the government.</p><p>\u201cIt is not about putting women where there were none, but about politicizing these issues and really promoting a transformation.\u201d</p><p>Some feminists have shown support for Sheinbaum, but both she and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-gender-debate-president-verbal-violence-66d283d15e6e68677d9bf2242c6c4d0d\">L\u00f3pez Obrador have also received criticism</a> for their lack of empathy towards women who protest against gender violence.</p><p>Amnesty International and other organizations have <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2021/03/mexico-autoridades-usaron-violencia-sexual-para-silenciar-mujeres/\">denounced excessive use of force against women</a> during International Women\u2019s Day protests and say that Mexican women\u2019s right to protest <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr41/3724/2021/en/\">has been stigmatized</a>.</p><p>According to Capdevielle, some of the issues that need to be addressed in Mexico\u2019s gender agenda are reproductive justice and women\u2019s participation in political processes.</p><p>\u201cThe right to get an abortion must be consolidated,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is far from being a reality for all women.\u201d</p><p>Comprehensive sexual education, access to contraceptives and the rights of the LGBTQ+ community should be prioritized as well, Capdevielle said.</p><hl2>WHAT ABOUT LGBTQ+ RIGHTS?</hl2><p>\u201cThe needs of this community are not likely to figure prominently in Mexico\u2019s presidential elections,\u201d said Cristian Gonz\u00e1lez Cabrera, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.</p><p>Gay and transgender populations are <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-transgender-killings-lgbtq-violence-samantha-gomez-266056d1f8a811b30ce69ef69741c26a\">regularly attacked and killed in Mexico</a>, a nation marked by its \u201cmacho\u201d culture and highly religious population. Human rights organization Letra S documented more than 500 <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/lgbtq-baena-death-mexico-hate-crime-148d5bcf5cec7952fa5b86d5b64882ac\">homicides of LGBTQ+ people in the last six years</a>, 58 of them in 2023.</p><p>The latest deaths came in 2024, with the murder of three members of the transgender community. This group, along with migrants, are particularly vulnerable to attacks, Gonzalez Cabrera said.</p><p>\u201cLGBT migrants continue to suffer abuse from criminal groups and Mexican officials,\u201d he said. \u201cToo often, these human rights violations are not effectively investigated or punished.\u201d</p><p>Sheinbaum said in 2023 that, as Mexico City\u2019s mayor, she created a special unit for trans people and said that her dream would be to continue fighting on behalf of sexual diversity, but did not go into specifics.</p><p>As for G\u00e1lvez, she showed support for women \u201cfrom the sexual diversity,\u201d but also did not delve into specifics.</p><p>Gonz\u00e1lez Cabrera highlights that since 2022 all Mexican states recognize same-sex marriage, but some LGBTQ+ rights are not yet guaranteed nationwide.</p><p>\u201cThere are 11 states where the legal recognition of gender identity for trans people is not possible through administrative means, despite a Supreme Court\u2019s ruling recognizing this right,\u201d he said.</p><p>For there to be an agenda in favor of the LGBTQ+ population, Gonz\u00e1lez Cabrera said, a government should approach the communities\u2019 organizations to learn about their needs, allocate resources to address violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity, support LGBTQ+ migrants and encourage local governments to align their legislation with the court\u2019s rulings on their rights.</p><p>____</p><p>Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u2019s <a href=\"https://bit.ly/ap-twir\">collaboration</a> with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

While abortion is a health-related issue, the document focuses more on the political, legal, and social aspects rather than health itself. It also touches on LGBTQ+ rights and gender violence, which are tangentially related to health but not the main focus. Therefore, the document is somewhat relevant to health but not highly focused on it."
