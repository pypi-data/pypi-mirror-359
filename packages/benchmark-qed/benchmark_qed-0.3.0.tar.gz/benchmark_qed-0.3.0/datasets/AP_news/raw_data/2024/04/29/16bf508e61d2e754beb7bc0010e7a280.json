The 88-year-old Mujica says the tumor was discovered during a routine checkup last Friday. He says the diagnosis compounds his health problems as he also suffers from an autoimmune disease. Better known as \u201cPepe\u201d Mujica, the former president, once a Marxist guerrilla, governed Uruguay from 2010 and 2015. His government was best known for legalizing same-sex marriage in the predominantly Roman Catholic country, boosting women's rights and making Uruguay the first nation in the world to fully legalize recreational marijuana. His folksy and self-effacing style made him into a leftist-liberal hero known around the world.",

He said the tumor discovered in his esophagus is particularly dangerous because he also suffers from an autoimmune disease.</p><p>\u201cThis is obviously very complicated and doubly so in my case,\u201d the ex-president who governed Uruguay from 2010 to 2015 told reporters Monday. He said doctors were assessing the best course of action but warned him that chemotherapy and surgery posed challenges.</p><p>Known among both fans and detractors as \u201cPepe\u201d Mujica, the folksy leader of Uruguay, a country of just 3.3 million people, was first a leader of the Tupamaros, the Marxist guerilla group that drew inspiration from the Cuban revolution.</p><p>In the 1960s and early 1970s, Mujica wielded weapons on Montevideo's streets in an effort to overthrow the government, getting shot by police several times and ultimately landing in prison until the fall of the country's dictatorship led to his release in 1985.</p><p>As Uruguay's 40th president, Mujica legalized same-sex marriage \u2014 a bold move in the predominantly Roman Catholic country \u2014 and boosted women's rights. He also made Uruguay the first nation in the world to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/legal-marijuana-uruguay-caribbean-latin-america-international-news-77d5e17147174241ae1d73529d42febc\">fully legalize recreational marijuana</a>.</p><p>He drew admiration in Uruguay and far afield as a politician who spoke with blunt honesty and lived up to his own values, shunning the presidential palace in favor of his modest house on the outskirts of Montevideo and donating most of his salary to charity.</p><p>\u201cI live as I think,\u201d <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/former-president-jose-mujica-nonreligious-secular-cd0b74cab9c5d7637e693c2b20a17b8b\">he told The Associated Press in an interview last fall</a>. \u201cWhen we have companions, we\u2019re not poor.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/international-international-general-news-5efa58e59035486286a0ddceb8e77bb3\">Although Mujica left the</a> Senate in 2020, he remained a powerful force in the Broad Front, a coalition of leftist parties and centrist social democrats.</p><p>In his characteristically charming and self-effacing style, Mujica turned the press conference on his diagnosis into a pep-talk for the country's youth.</p><p>\u201cI want to convey to all the young people that life is beautiful, but it wears you out and you fall,\" he said. \u201cThe point is to start over every time you fall. If there is anger, transform it into hope.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america\">https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america</a></p>",
