    "description_summary": "A trial for a mass environmental injury case is starting more than two years after a U.S. military fuel tank facility under ground poisoned thousands of people when it leaked jet fuel into Pearl Harbor's drinking water. The 17 plaintiffs represent more than 7,500 others, including service members. Lawyers for the plaintiffs argue Navy officials knew there was fuel in the water and failed to warn people not to drink it, even while telling residents the water was safe. Attorneys for the U.S. government dispute whether the plaintiffs were exposed to jet fuel at levels high enough to cause their alleged health issues.",

Crews went to homes and began taking water samples and officials shut down the Red Hill well as a precaution, she said.</p><p>They began \u201cflushing each and every home on the water line,\u201d to restore clean water, Yogiaveetil said. The Navy began providing bottled water and paid for months of hotel rooms for some affected families.</p><p>Lawyers for the plaintiffs argue Navy officials knew there was fuel in the water and failed to warn people not to drink it, even while telling residents the water was safe.</p><p>The families lost trust in the institutions they themselves served, Kristina Baehr, one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs, said in an opening statement.</p><p>\u201cHome was supposed to be a place they felt safe,\u201d especially during the pandemic, she said.</p><p>Nastasia Freeman, wife of a Navy officer and mother of three, described in her declaration how the family thought their vomiting and diarrhea was Thanksgiving food poisoning.</p><p>\u201cI had developed a rash on my arms with sores and lesions on my scalp, feet, and hands accompanied by a headache,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI had a very strange sensation that I had never had before \u2014 I felt like my blood was on fire.\u201d</p><p>Even their dogs were vomiting.</p><p>On Nov. 29, a nurse told her she received multiple calls all with a common theme: the tap water.</p><p>\u201cIt felt like we were being gaslit,\u201d Freeman's declaration said. \u201cWe knew the water wasn\u2019t safe, but the Navy was telling us that it was. They said they didn\u2019t know what was in the water and that they were \u2018investigating.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She was expected to be the first of the plaintiffs to be cross-examined in court Monday.</p><p>Experts will testify during the trial that the \u201cmyriad of injuries\u201d the plaintiffs claim were preexisting conditions or had no known link to the fuel exposure, Yogiaveetil said.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-poisoning-hawaii-world-war-ii-a72d487a44cdbf30875bad8b92036d46\">Navy investigation report</a> in 2022 listed a cascading series of mistakes from May 6, 2021, when an operator error caused a pipe to rupture and caused 21,000 gallons (80,000 liters) of fuel to spill while it was transferred between tanks. Most of this fuel spilled into a fire suppression line and sat there for six months, causing the line to sag. When a cart rammed into this sagging line on Nov. 20, it released 20,000 gallons (75,700 liters) of fuel.</p><p>When people started speaking up about the water, the Navy understood there had been a leak on Nov. 20, but at the time, they believed it was contained, Yogiaveetil said Monday.</p><p>The military eventually agreed to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hawaii-pearl-harbor-fuel-leak-poisoned-water-0fb1522c2bae09200494c1878fa6c155\">drain the tanks</a>, amid state orders and protests from Native Hawaiians and other Hawaii residents concerned about the threat posed to Honolulu\u2019s water supply. The tanks sit above an aquifer supplying water to 400,000 people in urban Honolulu.</p><p>Outside the courthouse Monday, activists calling themselves water protectors held signs in support of the plaintiffs.</p><p>A lot is riding on this trial.</p><p>\u201cA bellwether trial helps attorneys to understand the likely success or failure of the cases that are in the pipeline,\u201d explained Loretta Sheehan, a Honolulu-based personal injury attorney not involved in the water litigation.</p><p>The outcome can help determine future damages to be awarded or settlements, she said.</p>",
