It is designed to improve the accuracy and reliability of tests developed at large laboratories, including hospitals and universities. The FDA has warned for years that inaccurate test results can lead to unnecessary treatment and delays in getting proper care. Under the new requirements, labs will have about four years to win FDA approval for new tests. The FDA estimates there are about 80,000 medical tests already on the market. Those will not be required to get FDA approval.",

The goal is to ensure that new tests for cancer, heart disease, COVID-19, genetic conditions and many other illnesses are safe, accurate and reliable.</p><p>\u201cThe agency cannot stand by while Americans continue to rely on results from these tests without assurance that they work,\u201d FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told reporters on a conference call.</p><p>Califf said inaccurate tests can lead to unnecessary treatment or delays in getting proper care.</p><p>But in a significant move, the FDA decided that the tens of thousands of tests currently on the market will not have to undergo federal review. The agency said it will essentially grandfather those tests into approval to address concerns that the new rule \u201ccould lead to the widespread loss of access to beneficial\u201d tests.</p><p>Under the government's plan, most newly developed tests that pose a high risk \u2014 such as those for life-threatening diseases \u2014 will need to be FDA approved within 3 1/2 years. Lower risks tests will have four years to obtain approval.</p><p>All lab tests \u2014 old and new \u2014 will be required to register with the agency and report problems or errors. Based on this information, FDA officials said they will be able to target problematic tests.</p><p>\u201cIf we identify problems with the tests we can move forward to take action against them,\u201d said Dr. Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA's device center. \u201cWe think this overall strikes the right balance.\u201d</p><p>The agency also won\u2019t require approval of tests for which there are no alternatives, such as those for certain rare diseases.</p><p>The FDA already reviews tests and kits made by medical device manufacturers.</p><p>But labs, large hospitals and universities that develop their own in-house tests have been able to market them without each one undergoing agency review. The industry has resisted additional scrutiny for decades, saying it will stifle innovation and drive up costs.</p><p>There are an estimated 80,000 medical tests currently available from about 1,200 labs, according to the agency's estimate. They include tests for complex diseases, as well as simpler conditions like high cholesterol and sexually transmitted infections.</p><p>In the 1970s and \u201980s, most lab-based tests were \u201clower risk, small volume\u201d products used mostly for local patients, according to the FDA.</p><p>Over time, the tests have grown into a nationwide business, with labs processing thousands of blood, urine and other samples per week from hospitals and clinics. Others advertise directly to consumers \u2014 including some claiming to measure the risk of developing ailments like Alzheimer\u2019s and autism.</p><p>FDA officials have long voiced concerns about the accuracy of some tests, pointing to patients who have received inaccurate results for heart disease, Lyme disease and other conditions. Inaccurate tests can lead to patients getting an incorrect diagnosis, skipping treatments or receiving unnecessary medication or surgery.</p><p>More than a decade ago, the agency drafted tougher guidelines for the industry, but they were never finalized. For years, U.S. labs have successfully lobbied Congress and other federal institutions against tougher regulation.</p><p>When FDA released a draft of the new rule last September, a leading industry group argued the agency did not have legal authority to step into the testing market.</p><p>The American Clinical Laboratory Association said Monday it \u201chas grave concerns about this rule as a matter of both policy and law. The rule will limit access to scores of critical tests, increase health care costs, and undermine innovation in new diagnostics.\u201d</p><p>The group represents large testing chains such as Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp, as well as smaller labs and test makers.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
