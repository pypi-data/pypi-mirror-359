{"episode": "EP-30 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast with Collier Bloomberg bonus", "text": "KEVIN SCOTT: Hi, everyone.  Welcome to Behind the Tech.  I'm your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft. \n\nIn this podcast, we're going to get behind the tech.  We'll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did.  So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what's happening today.  Stick around.  \n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Hello, welcome to Behind the Tech. I\u2019m Christina Warren, Senior Cloud Advocate at Microsoft.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  And I\u2019m Kevin Scott.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And today our guests are Ben Bloomberg and Jacob Collier in a bonus episode of their conversation with Kevin. If you didn\u2019t catch the first half of their chat in the last show, definitely have a listen. \n\nAs many of you know, Jacob is a multi-Grammy Award-winning instrumentalist, songwriter, arranger and producer. He\u2019s up for three Grammys this year, including Album of the Year. And Ben is a creative technologist and recent PhD graduate from MIT.  Jacob and Ben began their collaboration about six years ago and have partnered to create music, and video, and a one-man stage tour\u2026well, you really just need to jump on YouTube and see for yourself because what they do is incredible.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, you have no idea how excited I was to do this interview. Like we\u2019ve been trying to get Jacob on the podcast for a while. I am an enormous fan of his and have been for several years now. I think like many people I discovered him on YouTube, where he began his musical career making these YouTube videos that were sort of visual and audio, just these rich, multilayered experiences, like everything from these sort of whimsical songs. Like he made this, video in a recording of The Flintstones, and won Grammy for that, like Flintstone\u2019s arrangement. But he\u2019s also like composed some incredibly compelling new music.\n\nThe thing that makes him relevant to this podcast, which is about technology, is that they use technology in such interesting ways to help Jacob realize his vision, and like part of that is like, you know, how you put a song together that is so layered and interesting, with you know, so many vocals and so many instruments. \n\nLike part of this is like how you translate that into a live performance which is very, very hard. And then part of that is like how he uses technology to create community and to collaborate, which I think is really, you know, interesting, and he\u2019s sort of a \u2013 you know, like an internet native, a YouTube native, a social media native, and you know, like he uses all of those things to an incredibly good creative effect. So, anyway, like, I\u2019m an enormous Jacob fan.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:\nAs am I. Ok so, the conversation got started before we even had a chance to do our sound check. But it was too good to not share. So next up you\u2019ll hear Kevin, Ben and Jacob first jumping on the line together. And then we\u2019ll pick up with the bonus episode from their extended interview. \n\n\n[MUSIC]\n\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hello!\n\nJACOB COLLIER: Hey Kevin!\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hey Jacob! And Ben. So nice to meet both of you.\n\nJACOB COLLIER: You too. This is amazing. And a privilege. And a treat indeed.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Oh goodness, it\u2019s such a privilege for me. You have no idea how many of your videos I\u2019ve watched.\n\nJACOB COLLIER: Jeez Louise.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: My wife and children and I have been running around all summer long listening to \u201cAll I Need\u201d and its variety of iterations. \n\nJACOB COLLIER:  There have been a few different versions at this point. That\u2019s amazing to hear. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s really interesting. I was, when I was a kid, a was an enormous \u2013 and I still am an enormous fan of classical piano, and one of my favorite pianists was Vladimir Horowitz. And he, you know, he had such a long performing career that he performed the same repertoire over and over and over again. But like, nothing was ever the same.\n\nLike other pianists, like everything had this consistency to it. And like his performances were just wildly different, sometimes just amazing. And sometimes like they were just total duds. But he just, he was fearless. Like, I don\u2019t even know if he was capable of performing the same thing the same way twice.\n\nI mean, is that. How do you think about a performance? Like they, they always seem to be, you know, mutating and changing, you know, with you?\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  Yeah, yeah, it\u2019s I guess it\u2019s something that you get addicted to after a while. You know, you can\u2019t do the thing you already did because that\u2019s already been done by you. So, you have to find something new. And, and Ben and I have been thinking in this way for, I guess a few years, I guess, since we met, you know, about six years ago now, whatever, whatever it was. But you know, once something has been done, you kind of seek the edge of it, and then you \u2013 you grow from there. You know, and so it\u2019s been a funny thing with \u201cAll I Need,\u201d but you know, I think it\u2019s eight \u2013 eight or nine different versions were in, so that song that now exists, and each one is \u2013 has, has taught us something new, and each one is kind of \u2013 evolves the song, and it evolves the concept, and gives me a clue about what it is that I like, and what it is that I \u2013 you know, I want to grow towards I guess. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  I really love you, the added a melodica to the \u2013 what was it, the Jimmy Kimmel performance?\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  Yeah, right.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  That was, that was a beautiful touch.\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  I appreciate it, like thanks so much.\n\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: All right, well that was just a little bit of 'behind the scenes.\u2019 You can see how great that conversation was and we hadn\u2019t even started yet. Now, let's get to the bonus episode, focused on AI and creativity.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  One of the things that I spend an enormous amount of my time on is AI. We are building very, very sophisticated systems for doing natural language and vision and speech. \n\nAnd, you know, increasingly AI is, you know, becoming a systems problem almost at the largest scales. So, like, we're building supercomputers to train models on.\n\nBut like, one of the things that\u2019s happening from all of that investment is AI is getting used in more and more places. And, you know, I\u2019m just really curious about how you all think about how AI plays a role in what it is that you\u2019re trying to create, like whether it\u2019s \u2013 you know, I\u2019ve seen AI systems that can imagine performances, like whole, like, actual performances, like, in the style of Chopin or Rachmaninoff or, like, pick your thing. \n\nLike, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s super interesting, but like, there are other ways that, like, AI is being used and, like, you know, you guys is like some of the best users of technology to create these experiences. I\u2019d just love to \u2013 love to hear how you\u2019re thinking about it.\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG:  Yeah, I think that\u2019s really interesting because there\u2019s \u2013 yeah, like you say, there\u2019s so many people trying to use AI to create sort of \u2013 sort of quote/unquote \u201ccreative performances\u201d or outputs. And it\u2019s really interesting because a lot of these systems, sort of the \u2013 the success metric for them is not being able to tell the original from, you know \u2013 or the output from the real thing, I guess we could say. So it\u2019s sort of a copy.\n\nAnd I think the big question that a lot of people have is whether it will ever get to the point where we value the AI for its own creativity rather than just sort of as an imitation.\n\nAnd, you know, one thing that we always say is, you know, you know, whether it\u2019s sort of style transcription or, you know, these models, Markov models and things that are combined to create these sort of very realistic, but not quite there representations of other things, all of that gets to what we would say is like maybe the 85th percentile of what we would call sort of good.\n\nAnd I feel like when you get to creativity, I think somebody like Jacob or \u2013 or anybody who\u2019s really coming up with truly new and groundbreaking sort of material is that\u2019s all in in the upper 5 percent of sort of what we can do. \n\nAnd so, you know, as a toolkit AI is really interesting to be able to sort of automate things that maybe would previously take a lot of work or would take a lot of, you know, sort of drudgery, but I have yet to see an application where it\u2019s going to come up with something, you know, necessarily truly new  or anything along the lines of, you know, like what Jacob would do, you know, where it\u2019s actually iterating. \n\nAnd, you know, of course, there\u2019s these things like GPT3 and, you know, even like Sony CSL and Francois Pachet\u2019s flow machines where people have gotten really far. And I think that has an application for like ads and cinema music, and things where we\u2019re not sort of really zeroed in, dialed in on \u2013 on, you know, on what this is. \n\nAnd then there\u2019s a whole, you know, genre of output where it\u2019s just completely surrealist and, you know, you look at like the half bird, half cow, you know, or all these faces that get generated. And that\u2019s kind of its own thing. It\u2019s, you know, different.\n\nBut Jacob and I talk a lot about, like, \u201cWell, could we create a harmonic intelligence that sort of like encodes Jacob\u2019s sense of composition and sort of harmony into an AI?\u201d And I think we could do that as a compositional tool for other people to use, but whether something is really going to actually be able to do what he does in the best way that we could do it, it would just be an imitation of what he had done up until that point and that would never be enough, I think.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Have you guys seen \u2013 so Google did this really cool thing called Blob Opera right around Christmas, which is, I think exactly what you\u2019re talking about. So it\u2019s more instrument than, you know, like a thing that\u2019s trying to create an entire performance or creative experience. \n\nAnd, like, it\u2019s sort of how we think about AI as well. Like, it\u2019s \u2013 like, I\u2019m not trying to \u2013 like, God knows, like, I would never try to replace someone like Jacob because, like, you know, the precious thing that we have in this world is our humanity. \n\nLike, what I want is to create more tools and more instruments to help us be more human, to enhance that humanity, not, you know, diminish it or like take the dignity away from it by, you know, sort of substituting for it. \n\nAnd, you know, I thought that Blob Opera, like in an artistic context, was like an interesting thing. You know, they trained it from a bunch of professional opera singers voices and, you know, like, they gave those voices an instrumentality for, you know, other people to play around with, which is interesting.\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  I love it when it applies to play and when it gives you ideas. From my perspective, you know, the half cow, half cat thing is wicked. I love that. I mean, I love hybrid animal images anyway. I have like a soft spot for them. But, you know, I think it\u2019s really brilliant when it\u2019s not trying to be reasonable because then it breaks me out of my show and something becomes possible for me that wasn\u2019t possible before, that I wouldn\u2019t have thought of it because I\u2019m only a human, you know. That\u2019s cool for me. \n\nI think AI trying to be serious is doomed to fail, partly because I think of the way that it would \u2013 the way that it would receive feedback, actually. If you go back to the feedback loop thing, if you put an AI on stage and you give it an audience response, I don\u2019t know if it would be able to read that. \n\nAnd I think that the amount of humanity that\u2019s needed to turn up and care about all the different levels of that kind of empathy mixed with confidence, mixed with kind of fearlessness, mixed with doubt, mixed with inspiration, the sort of combination of elements there, you know, plus collaboration if you\u2019re on stage with other people.\n\nAnd even, you know, it\u2019s a bit like comic timing. You know, it\u2019s like doesn\u2019t AI get better than a human at comic timing? Because a lot of being on stage is about this is the moment for this or now is the moment for this in just a moment. Or I\u2019m just going to wait a moment longer so the audience can laugh again or so the audience can feel what that meant or whatever.\n\nThose kinds of \u2013 that to me is why I love touring, not because, you know, people buy more tickets, for example, to the shows or because the applause is louder after a particular song, or there\u2019s more voices that sing along, you know, these kinds of things. And sure, these are metrics that I will judge the performance on to a point, like, everyone was singing in that last song, I must have done a good job. But actually I just don\u2019t think an AI would necessarily ever be subtle enough to and some ways imperfect enough to care. \n\nYou know, it takes a performer to be on stage and second guess what you\u2019re doing to make it special. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah.\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  You know, you can parrot something. It doesn\u2019t work so well. And that to me feels like one of the most fundamental differences is how \u2013 like how the kind of consequence of a creative action is reacted to and how that\u2019s received and then changed. \n\nBecause sometimes you stick \u2013 you say, I\u2019m not going to listen to you and you flirt and sometimes you say, yeah, okay, I\u2019ll go with you, audience, or you say, oh, okay, that\u2019s a good idea, I\u2019ll move with that. And sometimes you say\u2026 you know what I mean, just it\u2019s so dynamic and it\u2019s so able to be replicated.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. Look, and I think even if you could build an AI that would do all of those things, like, what I\u2019m chasing in music is goosebumps. And if an AI gives me goosebumps, it feels like manipulation. Whereas if a performer gives me goosebumps, it feels like connection. \n\nAnd like, I just don\u2019t even \u2013 like, even if you could have it, which I think you\u2019re right, like, it would be very, very, very hard, it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not looking to be manipulated. I want to be \u2013 I want a connection.\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  I think when I get goosebumps, I sense a fallibility in something that I relate to. I think that\u2019s almost \u2013 that is often what gives me goosebumps is like, \u201cWow, and you\u2019re still shining anyway, you know, wow. So lucky and so shiny. Wow. I can\u2019t \u2013\u201c Like I see a part of myself in some things, imperfections, or in some thing\u2019s kind of power or in some \u2013 I don\u2019t know, you can\u2019t \u2013 you can\u2019t articulate it, you can\u2019t, but AI by nature is not fallible because it\u2019s always the best iteration of itself.\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG:  It has to be articulated.\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  Exactly, yeah, everything has already been articulated, and the thing that\u2019s unspoken-\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG:  Yeah. And I think, Kevin, what you said at the beginning, you know, we\u2019re trying to have the technology get out of the way. And it\u2019s such a narrow balance of sort of feeling \u2013 you know, getting those goosebump moments and not pulling people out of the sort of immersion. And that\u2019s very difficult. And that\u2019s a very hard problem to quantify. There\u2019s a lot of unknowns and there\u2019s a lot of constraints.\n\nOn the other hand, if you can use something like AI to \u2013 you know, for example, with the looping show, we always talk about giving Jacob 12 arms so that he can play 12 instruments at the same time. That starts to get interesting. Or maybe, you know, there\u2019s a system out there now where you feed it a photo of a room and it gives you a reverb trail for that \u2013 for that room. Those tools start to start to be fun. So I think we\u2019re excited to explore that going forward.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Well, look, I think, you know, I\u2019m not a musician, so, like, I \u2013 maybe what I\u2019m about to say is just sort of nonsense, but, you know, it seems to me like there\u2019s just this distinct difference between a score and instruments and a performance. You know, like I can listen to Murray play that \u2013 you know, that \u2013 that Chopin G minor ballade, like, I can get goosebumps at the moment. Like, I can go look at the score and it\u2019s like, okay, like, you know, like, I and I have many, many times, like, all right, you know, what is going on here that is giving me goosebumps. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not the score because like, I can, like, put the score through a MIDI player and like it can, you know, robotically play the notes and it\u2019s like, \u201c All right, no goosebumps there.\u201d You know, I can listen to a whole bunch of other performers, play it, no goosebumps there. Like, there\u2019s just something about this very, like, very complex that \u2013 you know, and it just feels deeply human and, like, I don\u2019t want a machine trying to replicate that. You know, but if a machine could come in and, like, help a human, like, produce more of that, like great.\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  And sometimes it can be helpful to \u2013 to bounce off an \u2013 to bounce an idea off against something that\u2019s neutral as well. You know, if I\u2019m working on something and I share it with a friend of mine or someone in my family or whatever, then I kind of risk their judgment filtering into my own view of the song and then my mind being changed or whatever, you know. \n\nAnd that doesn\u2019t change, doesn\u2019t matter how old you are, you always have that slight fear when you show someone something that they might just say, oh, this is whatever. \n\nBut I can imagine a world where there\u2019s some kind of creative feedback from human to AI where the human gets a cool idea based off something that the human could never have imagined, if it generates ideas or makes space, then \u2013 then humans will fill it and that\u2019s cool. That\u2019s exciting.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, you know, this is the other thing, too, about \u2013 about AI, like imagining an AI that was trying to compose a thing or deliver a performance the same way that you do. \n\nLike you \u2013 you know, one of the things that I think is very interesting about what you do is you don\u2019t always give people what they\u2019re expecting in a song, like, you will \u2013 you\u2019ll be sort of trucking along and it\u2019s like, okay, like, you know, here\u2019s the \u2013 here\u2019s what we expect. And then you will, like, do this harmonic thing that\u2019s like, \u201cOh, crap, like, why is there dissonance here now?\u201d \n\nAnd, you know, and if you, like, the things that are really good at is sort of, like, reading, you know, reading someone\u2019s response to a thing and like giving them more of what they want. \n\nAnd like, the special thing that you do is, like, you are, like, challenging us to think more about the music by occasionally and strategically giving us something that we\u2019re not expecting. And like, I just don\u2019t know how you like build the projective function of the feedback loop for that. \n\nBEN BLOOMBERG:  Or like even literally making up new notes. \n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  And like I just don\u2019t know how you build the objective function of the feedback loop with that.\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG:  That\u2019s totally the challenge.\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  It\u2019s a really individual dance, isn\u2019t it. Like everyone has to do their \u2013 you know, my idea of what too much is or too dissonant or the right moment, like, that changes all the time. And I learn from things I like and from things I don\u2019t like and all this stuff\u2013 and then I just come out and I\u2019m a person, you know.\n\nAnd I think what can be moving about that, if it works well, is that a person is doing it all, you know, and as you say, you could take the same notes and something else can put them together in exactly that way, but something is kind of always lost. \n\nAnd yeah, there\u2019s that funny dance between, you know \u2013 and I \u2013 I struggle with this every single day when I write. It\u2019s like, how much do I give you what you want and pander to the thing that will do well or people like or is reasonable to do or makes \u2013 you know, it makes sense or you know, and then how much do I \u2013 do I\u2013 do the opposite, do I push you in the \u2013 in the other direction? That push-pull is magical. It really is interesting.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah. Have you guys seen this? There\u2019s a video of Bobby McFerrin at a neuroscience conference where they\u2019re sort of talking about, you know, what\u2019s built into our brains about music. \n\nAnd he gets up in front of the audience and he like hums a note on the pentatonic scale and points at the audience. And, like, he says nothing, but he points at the audience and then they parrot the note back to him.\n\nAnd then he does this thing where he grounds that note on the pentatonic scale to a position and then he jumps and he goes to the next note on the scale and hums it and then points at the audience and they hum it. And then like, they\u2019ve got the pattern. And then he like does this performance on the audience, where as he\u2019s jumping, they just automatically know, without him having to hum it, like, what\u2019s the next set of notes are on the scale. \n\nAnd it\u2019s like the most incredible thing. It\u2019s like \u2013 and, you know, he says at the end of it that no matter where he goes in the world, he can do this same experiment with an audience and, like, they all have the pentatonic scale in their head. \n\nAnd so, like we do have this expectation in our head about, you know, like what a musical performance is. And, like, you know, I think the things that you do are sort of interesting in that, like you sort of are pushing, you know, that inbuilt thing that we\u2019ve got in our head in, like, very compelling ways. You know, and again, like it\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s just about like, you know, giving people a new lens on, like, something that biologically even they may, like, just deeply understand and expect.\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  I guess you could say the same for storytelling. I love that \u2013 that video of Bobby\u2019s. I was bowled over the first time I saw it, and it gave me all sorts of ideas. \n\nBut I was going to say, it\u2019s the same with the stories in the sense that, you know, everyone kind of knows about, you know, departure and arrival, and everyone kind of knows about, you know, hate and love and kind of, yeah, just, I guess, tension and release in a primary color sense. People tend to feel that. \n\nAnd so, in some ways, our job as artists is to it could be with a completely new set of materials. It could be like, I\u2019m going to lay out the fundamental elements of this equation here. Like, this is the ground, the resting point. And then here is \u2013 and these are the elements that are attached to that. And then maybe one of these elements is to make a journey away to a different place. And this is the other. And then maybe there\u2019s some complication or there's a tension or a change of speed or something is inverted or whatever. \n\nAnd then, you know, something happens over here and \u2013 and eventually you may be moved to a new place or maybe whatever. And then maybe at the end, you come back home and you land home and you think, oh, I remember \u2013 I remember what this feels like. This is some kind of resolution. Now, obviously, not all stories are like that and so forth.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  But \u2013 but a lot \u2013 a lot of them are. I mean, like, it\u2019s very interesting. I mean, so, you know, you have this Joseph Campbell, you know, Hero with a Thousand Faces, you know, like so many of our stories, like fit this pattern.\n\nAnd so, like, there\u2019s just something, you know, again, like the pentatonic scale almost, like, it\u2019s almost like we\u2019re sort of built in with this, you know, this narrative framing of what a story ought to be. \n\nYou know, and on the one hand, that\u2019s amazing. And on the other hand, it\u2019s sort of depressing. Like, you don\u2019t want to think that every story has to fit that pattern in order to be interesting.\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  I think people just \u2013 people keep on iterating different ways of making tension and then releasing the tension. And that\u2019s, like, so interesting in kind of like an infinite way and has unlimited potential for innovation and kind of new feelings, new spaces, new whatever. \n\nBen, what do you think?\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG:  I actually think that that\u2019s true for designing the \u2013 the production technology and the instruments as well. Because you really \u2013 you know, you really are trying to create the sort of infrastructural pieces that support that through the performance.\n\nAnd, yeah, you know, you can spend all this time on engineering and trying to sort of get all of your details correct. And in the end, it\u2019s really about sort of supporting that kind of story and that kind of experience.\n\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, and maybe even building the infrastructure in a way, I mean, like I think you said this earlier, like, you don\u2019t want the instrument to dictate the performance. Like, you don\u2019t want to make too many assumptions about what the performance is going to be, you know, that you are constrained by the instrumentality or the \u2013 you know, like the \u2013 you know, yeah, I don't know, it\u2019s like fascinating.\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG:  It\u2019s actually interesting, it\u2019s a funny balance because we sort of say \u2013 this is sort of slightly related, is that there\u2019s this balance between something being too obvious and sort of not obvious enough.\n\nSo when it comes to technology on stage, if you are \u2013 if the audience can\u2019t tell how the technology is sort of connected to what the performer is doing and what the music is doing, that\u2019s not great because they\u2019ll get \u2013 you know, they \u2013 it\u2019s just confusing. If it\u2019s really obvious that, like, you push this button and it makes that noise, it\u2019s also \u2013 it gets kind of boring really fast. And so there\u2019s this middle ground where you\u2019re sort of playing with expectation and you kind of draw people in, and that\u2019s something that we chase. Like, we really are trying to find things that are complex in an interesting way. \n\nAnd I think in terms of building the Harmoniser, that was sort of the \u2013 that was the most important piece is to find something that\u2019s sort of infinite in very connected ways to what Jacob is doing. So \u2013 so using the voice as an input, for example, is \u2013 does that because there\u2019s so much variability, sort of continuous and it\u2019s so directly connected to what Jacob\u2019s doing. But it\u2019s also very clear what that connection is. \n\nSo I think that --that\u2019s \u2013 yeah, that\u2019s a huge thing that we care a lot about when we\u2019re building all this stuff.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  That\u2019s so fascinating. So, we\u2019re almost out of time here, although I could talk to you guys all day long, like this is so great. Maybe the last question I\u2019ll ask is, you did this fellowship or residency at MIT. I watched some of the video there, like one of the things that you did is give an orchestral performance of \u201cHideaway.\u201d I don\u2019t know, Ben, if you were like \u2013 obviously you were a PhD student at MIT. When did you defend your dissertation, like recently?\n\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG:  Yeah. In February. In November.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Congratulations, man! That is unbelievably awesome. You should be so proud of yourself, like it\u2019s just great. \n\nBut so, like in that residency at MIT, like for me, I felt like you just did this incredibly moving thing. Like \u201cHideaway\u201d is-- like I watched a bunch of your videos before and I\u2019m like, my god, these are so interesting and entertaining. \u201cHideaway\u201d was moving, like I don\u2019t know what it is--the lyrics. And then translating that to this orchestral thing with this big group of people, it\u2019s just super interesting. Did you realize there was something special going on with that song, and that whole experience of creating a thing with so many people?\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  I didn\u2019t think too much about it, honestly. I think I knew the song was special when I wrote it because I was opening a real door to my own creative process. Because I\u2019d never done anything like that before. I\u2019d never written a song, funnily enough. It was almost like I said, well, what if I gave myself permission to just write a song? And like a few times I\u2019ve done this, it starts being kind of simple and ends up kind of complex and detailed and stuff. So, it starts with this kind of simple melody, and takes you on another journey and it moves away. I was very excited about that, and it felt like I was touching something that felt new and felt interesting. You know when you\u2019ve just gone further out on a limb than you\u2019ve ever gone, you\u2019re just walking and you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going to go? That feeling, and an idea, it was a special moment with \u201cHideaway.\u201d\n\nI remember, Ben, when we say and put it together in my room, I mean, we\u2019re mixing everything and we were thinking about how that song felt. We both kind of felt this was a song that we loved. But I think our job at that point was just to see the song as what it was at that point and put it on the album, which we did. The orchestral arrangement thing was such a whole other level. Because I\u2019ve sat in my room and made music, and kind of done it alone for so long. The feeling of taking a song like \u201cHideaway,\u201d which is almost about that space, about this space of making music here, being alone and the trust within that, and the questioning within that \u2013 all that. To take that and to kind of walk up on the other side of the world, and have such kind of wonderful, enthusiastic, warm-hearted people who were there to play it, it was really, really crazy for me. Because it\u2019s important to remember at that time, I had very little experience of meeting anybody who had listened to my music outside of my friends. I\u2019d basically just left home, kind of thing.\n\nIt was like I was just \u2013 you know. When I went to meet Ben, that was my first flight alone without my mom ever, to the States in 2015. It was only about a year later that we were doing those songs in Kresge Hall at MIT. It\u2019s a spectacular feeling, and you feel very small and very big at the same time. You know, you feel like you\u2019re kind of \u2013 your values are resonating, quite literally, in a space filled with people. But you feel you\u2019re one of a great number, and the whole thing is much bigger than you are. So, it\u2019s a mixture of kind of humbling, and joyous, and I suppose almost like a celebration of what life is about.\n\nYou know, you slave away at these ides, these songs, these concepts, these technological accomplishments, these things we build and dream up, and then there\u2019s a moment where you have to take your hands off the wheel and say, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s put this in the world and see what happens, and let\u2019s see what people make of it.\u201d\n\nI remember playing \u201cHideaway,\u201d and I\u2019ll never forget playing \u201cHideaway\u201d at that particular gig, and it was really slow. We did it really, really slowly. We did it way slower on the gig than we\u2019d ever done it in rehearsal. It was like 30 BPM, really slow, but it felt really special and really good. We were really swimming in the spirit of it. It\u2019s almost the moment where you look back and you say, \u201cSo that\u2019s what the song was about. I didn\u2019t know it until now.\u201d You kind of have to jump into the water, see what happens with something, to be able to look back and say, huh. That\u2019s what it was all about.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  You know, this is one of the things that I love so much about music, because there\u2019s just this mysterious element to it. We can talk about all the things, like the harmony, the music theory, the technical aspects of playing the instruments, like the software, the harmonizer, the mixing.\n\nBut then you have this performance, right? There\u2019s a handful of things in music that literally give me goosebumps, like right down my spine. It\u2019s just a handful. So, Murray Perahia playing Chopin\u2019s G Minor ballade, like right around bar 63 where the tension is building up and then it just blows out. Like goosebumps, every time. Like Mozart\u2019s the Adagio, beginning of the Adagio for the Clarinet Concerto, goosebumps every time. Like that performance of \u201cHideaway,\u201d like goosebumps every time. I can\u2019t explain it, I don\u2019t know why, I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s that performance and not the video. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s that song and not others. I don\u2019t even understand what\u2019s going on there. But it\u2019s like something that obviously, there\u2019s something neurobiologically going on in your brain, and it feels like a connection. It\u2019s incredibly special, and I don\u2019t think anybody knows how to replicate it. It\u2019s just great.\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  Thanks so much for saying that. Yeah, I was goosebumps all over in performance, which is always a sign that I\u2019m doing something right. But yeah, as Ben and I try to think about things sometimes, I think we just sort of follow our goosebumps into the next thing that we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll follow it and see where it goes.\u201d We don\u2019t know. No one knows. I think if there\u2019s one thing the last 12 months have taught us, it\u2019s whatever you think you knew, you don\u2019t know. But you can still turn up, you know? And you can still find joy in stuff, and you can still play.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  That\u2019s so fascinating. Again, like I could\u2013 I could talk all day with you all. Again, I\u2019d love to meet you all in person and just spend \u2013 spend a bunch of good time chatting. \n\n\nJACOB COLLIER:  Yeah, that sounds brilliant. I\u2019d love to. I\u2019d absolutely love to, yeah.\n\nBEN BLOOMBERG:  Yeah, thank you. Thank you.\n\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: \nWell, that was Kevin\u2019s conversation with Ben Bloomberg and Jacob Collier. \nKevin, you didn\u2019t talk too much about AI in your conversation, although you were talking about technology and how things have evolved. But I was just curious, from your perspective, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen the Jukebox project from OpenAI, it\u2019s basically a neural net that generates music. And I curious if you had any thoughts about that project or projects like it and how those worlds could interact in the future with people who are doing and creating things like the work that Ben and Jacob are so good at.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, I think it\u2019s an incredibly interesting space. We got into it a little bit right at the very end of the episode, and, like, maybe that\u2019s the, you know, the next episode if we can persuade them to be back on. \n\nI think that these AI technologies have an enormous potential to help power the creativity of artists and entrepreneurs and makers of all ilks, and, you know, Jukebox is really interesting. \n\nYou know, one of the things that we talked about is to me, the application of that AI will be most interesting when it puts a tool into the hands of a creator that helps them to expand their creative possibilities and opens up their horizons to new things that they couldn\u2019t do before. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Yeah.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  The thing that\u2019s not interesting to me is, like, things that you\u2019re trying to do where you make the AI itself like the sole creative agent. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  Right. Right. Yeah, no, I totally agree with you, and  I think it would be great if we could have Ben and Jacob back to talk more about that, because I totally agree with you, it\u2019s not that interesting for the AI to be the creator, but if the AI could be used to make the tools better, so that the output could be even more new and different, that could be really, really special.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  Yeah, and look, I think we\u2019re at the point now where the tools are capable of a lot. Things like Jukebox and, like, there have been a few other experiments. Like, we\u2019ve even done some things at Microsoft Research. And I know Huawei has done a few interesting things where you can have an AI now compose a piece of classical music in the style of your favorite composer. You can say, you know, write me a piano piece that\u2019s in the style of Rachmaninoff or Chopin, and it can do something that is stylistically very much like Rachmaninoff or Chopin. And you just sort of listen to it the first time and you\u2019re like, wow. \n\nThere\u2019s this YouTube channel called TwoSet Violin that are these two professional violinists who, like, comedically have these conversations on YouTube about classical music, and on one of their episodes, they looked at, I think, that Huawei AI that was trying to write the third movement of Schubert\u2019s Unfinished Symphony.\n\nAnd, like, it\u2019s just sort of staggering, like what the AI did, like it, you know, it in that third movement, like really picked up the, you know, sort of the stylistic things that made Schubert special and, like, gave him a unique voice as a composer. \n\nWhether or not the thing was compelling, like, who knows? But, you know, I think what we really need to do is to get these tools into the hands of artists who will actually figure out the interesting things to do with the technology. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN:  One hundred percent, 100 percent. And that\u2019s the thing that makes me excited as somebody who loves both music and art.\n\nAll right, well, that\u2019s all for today. We were so delighted to have Ben and Jacob on the show. So, thank you again to both of them.\n\nSend us a message anytime at BehindtheTech@microsoft.com, and thank you for listening.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT:  See you next time!\n\n"}
