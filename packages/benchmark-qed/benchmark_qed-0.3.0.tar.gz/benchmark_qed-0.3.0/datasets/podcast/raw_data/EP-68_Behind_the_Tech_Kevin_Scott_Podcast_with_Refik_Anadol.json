{"episode": "EP-68 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast with Refik Anadol", "text": "REFIK ANADOL: Digital artists like myself, the movement that\u2019s enjoying computation, games and creativity with AI and so forth, we were the blind spot for the museums and galleries, super honestly. And it\u2019s quantifiable for many reasons, because it\u2019s a new movement. It\u2019s a new reaction to the like field. The art world has a concrete base, like centuries old techniques and tools. And it\u2019s this revolution, it\u2019s this renaissance happening right now we are all living in.  \nKEVIN SCOTT: Hello, welcome to Behind the Tech. I'm your host, Kevin Scott. My co-host, Christina Warren, is out doing some really cool things at GitHub, so it's just me today. Before I introduce our guest, anyone who has been watching the world even a bit over the past month is aware of the horrifying destruction wreaked by Hurricane Helene in the US Southeast. One of the most devastated areas was in northern and western North Carolina, in particular the Asheville region. \nAs I've been delving more and more into the art and craft of ceramics in my personal life, I've learned that one of the strongest concentrations of ceramic craft and artisans in the country is right there in Asheville. There are a bunch of folks in that community who really could use your help to start pulling their lives and livelihoods back together after such a terrible loss. Namely those at East Fork and Mud Tools, as well as individual artists like Akira Satake and John Britt. \nWe'll share their information in the show notes and anyone who is inclined to support would be playing a huge part in helping them get back on their feet. And we're still accepting questions for our upcoming Ask Me Anything episode. If you have questions for me, please send us an email at behindthetechatmicrosoft.com. \nSo on the podcast today is Refik Anadol. I met Refik at an event that both of us had the pleasure of attending earlier this year. And one of the things that we were discussing at that event was the nature of art. Refik is an incredible artist and is using AI in really adventurous and creative ways. I've been a big fan of his work for a long while. \nWhat he is doing and what he's done over the past few years as these new AI tools have created new possibilities for art and artists has been just extraordinary. So I'm really delighted that we've got him on the show today and I'm really looking forward to this conversation. So let's dive right in.\n[MUSIC]\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Refik Anadol is an internationally renowned media artist, director and pioneer in the esthetics of data and machine intelligence. He\u2019s the director of Refik Anadol\u2019s Al Studio in Los Angeles and a lecturer in UCLA\u2019s Department of Design, Media Arts. \n \nAnadol\u2019s projects consist of data-driven, machine learning algorithms that create abstract, colorful environments. His work addresses the challenges and possibilities that ubiquitous computing has imposed on humanity, exploring how the perception and experience of time and space are radically changing in the digital age.\n \nAnadol\u2019s immersive and audio/visual installations, and live audio visual performances have been exhibited worldwide, transforming entire buildings and creating dynamic perception of space. His work has been featured in venues such as the Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Dongdaemun Design Plaza in Seoul.\n \nAnadol holds a BA in Photography and Video and an MFA in Visual Communication Design from Istanbul Bilgi University, as well as a second MFA from the Design Media Arts program at UCLA. \n \nAnd I will say, personally, I adore your work, so it is a real pleasure to have you here with us today. And I think we\u2019re going to have a really important conversation because the intersection of art and artificial intelligence is, you know, a hot topic of debate right now. \n \nSo but maybe we can just sort of start by talking about how it is you got interested in both art and technology and, like, where for you did those two things first, intersect.\n \nREFIK ANADOL: Absolutely. Kevin, first of all, again, thank you so much for this wonderful moment. We had incredible conversations before, and I\u2019m so again honored to share the journey with you and everyone. \n \nSo it is like, truly, I will say, a very childish start. I was eight years old in Istanbul, and my mom one day, completely randomly, we thought, I guess guessing, she brought home a Commodore, a very first computer. And it was a fascinating eight years old, you know, moment, right, like the first time seeing a computer. There was like a small, like booklet from it that, like, shows how to, like very much basically basic like programing. And then I think the part I\u2019m still super in love with, of course, games. I love games so much. And that was a beautiful start. \n \nAs a child, I think we always respond back to reality as positive as possible, as hopeful as possible. And I watched my first dystopian science fiction movie, Blade Runner, same age, and I think it was this moment, okay, the machines can like, become a friend, like a game, a companion or imagination part, and then we can see the future of architecture in Blade Runner, such as the media architecture, flying car and android tells the other android that these are not your memories; this is someone else\u2019s. I mean, as a child, I still cannot forget this  epiphany. \n \nAnd I didn\u2019t stop with computers, I would say the life and imagination. So grateful that in my undergrad year, 2008 in Istanbul, I was a very beautiful moment with a mentor of mine, Peter Weibel, which we lost this year.\n \nHe was the founder of the world\u2019s first art, science and technology museum called ZKM. And in his class, it\u2019s the first time I was able to use a software called Pure Data, which is like a very early open source visual programing language that I will say that I very much get so inspired at visualizing the sensors, which is making invisible/visible moments and seeing like literally ultrasound sensors and be able to take like a light, a point and line geometry of the sensor. \n \nAnd I think in that class I coined the term data painting, the idea of data can become a material, if you think that is a form of memory, and that memory can take any shape and form. \n \nSo since then, now 16 years, I was able to work with the heartbeat data, skin conductance, brain signals, weather data. Pretty much anything we can quantify, I believe, can be a form of art. \n \nAnd that journey is still keep going now as a studio in Los Angeles, California. We are 20 people, can speak 15 languages and 10 countries. \n \nAnd I\u2019m also grateful that I received the Microsoft Research Award 2013. I was at the UCLA, and that was a moment that I remember truly connect with the academia as an artist to think about art, science, technology together can create work.\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So I want to talk a little bit more about your journey as an artist, because, I mean, it\u2019s really interesting. I think you and I had approximately the same exposure to computers. I think I\u2019m older than you, but, you know, like a very similar experience. Like, I got one of these consumer computers when I was a teenager, and I was just fascinated by the device, but also like really intrigued by how you could use this technology to make games. Like, I was really into Dungeons and Dragons, I was into video games. \n \nLike, I was \u2013 you know, and I also, you know, at the time, I didn\u2019t know I was going to become a computer scientist. The thing that I really wanted to do when I was 12 years old is I wanted to be a comic book illustrator. But for, you know, reasons I don\u2019t even quite understand, like as I got older and older, I gravitated more towards not just technology, but kind of the utilitarian aspects of the technology. So, like, I just really loved using computers to make tools for other people to use. \n \nSo how do you think it is that you, like, chose the vector that you\u2019re on, or did the vector choose you, or like, I mean these questions always are fascinating to me.\n  \nREFIK ANADOL: That\u2019s a great question. I think very, very similar, I think, feeling. I felt that  as a person, I really, truly enjoyed this idea of a discovery and innovations. Like, I feel like, but more in the creative side of like, for example, I mean, I still remember like finding an exciting hack of like a machine is as inspiring as, like, hey, like, you know, like I can do that, and you can \u2013 like this sharing moment was never, never was a question. \n \nBut what I felt so inspiring is when I start to combine multiple elements such as, you know, computation, architecture, or like most importantly, I will say, as soon as I start to see the buildings as canvas, for example, like because I think that architecture is an incredible form of surfaces. I believe that any form of architecture can become a canvas, the building facades, the  floor, the ceiling, the window of the door. \n \nBecause as soon as we liberate this idea of a material, which means what happens if you take the light and data together and imagine this new non-Newtonian material maybe that can disappear if you don\u2019t want it, but we can program it through algorithms and data that can take any shape and form. As soon as like that create that epiphany moment, I couldn\u2019t stop imagining. \n \nAnd I feel like the future of architecture is so inspiring because they can reflect as humanity. Of course, there\u2019s lots of function to protect us from the Mother Nature, but also they can have a function of like other imaginations. And since that moment, like it\u2019s so fun. \n \nAnd then the computation in general, I mean, I\u2019m a digital artist. That means that I don\u2019t have a connection so much with the physical world, even though I cannot draw properly or write, but I know how to compute geometrically, you know, the voxels, the pixels. And like really living in digital space became this so inspiring. \n \nAnd then on top of that, I really inspired from the science so much. Huge respect, you know, to the research going on in computer science, in other sciences. Super in love with and respectfully looking how incredible people are pushing forward technology, and just try to capture that positivity and just blend it with this imaginary materials is, I think, where I get so excited. And then learn programing and then on top of it computer graphics. And I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about neuroscience because I believe that buildings can dream and hallucinate one day, if you do it right. So all these, like connected together naturally, I will say. \n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, so I \u2013 the two things that I really want to chat about later is, I think you and I were at an event together earlier this year where, you know, we in a group were being asked to ponder the question, like, what is art? And, like, you know, I definitely want to talk about that later. And I also want to talk about your work in particular. \n \nBut before we do that, like how did you decide that this is what you wanted to do for your career? Like, did you have encouragement from your parents? Like, did you have some concept that I\u2019m going to be able to do this and make money, you know, so I can pay my rent and you know?\n  \nREFIK ANADOL: An amazing question because for generally, I have two, again, I think, breaking points. First of all, truly grateful for the family because I have 14 teachers in my family. So I grow up with like a learning to learn as the fundamental layer of like fabric of life. So I don\u2019t remember saying \u201cI don\u2019t know something\u201d because it felt always not right before researching, learning like what is my capacity of understanding of that specific topic.\n \nAnd then on top of it, it just became this, I mean, yeah, people say, you know, nerding about the topic, but it\u2019s actually learning about a topic. And then when you learn about it, it becomes, you know, an extension of life, and our cognitive capacity of life. So I never quit that moment of like learning. \n \nAnd then I\u2019m so grateful that in the journey, as soon as I know that, I think I feel myself art, science, technology in that \u2013 a point of interest and nobody stop in the family. Like, they just trusted that this can be the right thing. So very grateful. \n \nBut the financial part was really challenging because generally speaking, art world is a relatively challenging environment for artists to create a value with their work, for many reasons. There\u2019s like a gallery world, there\u2019s a museum world, and there\u2019s a collector world that\u2019s like where the financial value comes to the art making. \n \nSo I am an artist without a gallery representation, meaning independent, which makes it much harder because that means that I have to navigate through the whole, like in my own social media, like my self and studio, which was a much more entrepreneurial challenge on top of the journey.\n \nBut I find it so inspiring because over the last 10 years as a studio, we honestly, openly like shared everything online that what happened, happened wherever we go and that like, naturally grow. \n \nBut I\u2019m so grateful that, again, I come back to the Microsoft Research Award as a student 2013. I knew that I want to open a studio. I know that I\u2019m not an alone person; I should be a team of people exploring the concept, context. I know that as a human myself, I have a capacity of like cognitive limits. But if I become a team, maybe we can invent new ways of imagination, computation, AI research, neuroscience, and so forth. That was like, well, oh, this is like, totally a dream. \n \nAnd it started very hard in the beginning. But people who have been understanding the movement, pioneers of technology, or the people who have been creating important products and services about technology, they completely got it. They directly understand that a new art form, a new speculation about an idea, a dream, a sculpture, a painting completely fit very well. \n \nAnd so, I\u2019m so grateful to Los Angeles, UCLA and all our supporters across the journey that grow very naturally and very challenging but very grateful that turn into a value.\n  \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. And I know a lot of artists. Yeah, stage one, it seems like, is like you just sort of have to figure out, you know, any sort of economics, like, how can I get paid at all to, like, you know, do this creative thing. And then, you know, once you figured that out, like, I know a bunch of artists who the next question is like, how do I make sure that I\u2019ve got the real creative freedom that I want? So, you know, like basically, you know, being sponsored to just do whatever versus like, you know, doing things like taking commissions where you have like a very rigid set of constraints that you\u2019re operating in. And you seem to have navigated that super well, but like, how tricky has that been?\n \nREFIK ANADOL: Ooh, it is very, very. So first of all, I will be super honest that digital artists like myself, the movement that\u2019s enjoying computation, games and creativity with AI and so forth, we were the blind spot for the museums and galleries, super honestly. And it\u2019s quantifiable for many reasons, because it\u2019s a new movement. It\u2019s a new reaction to the like field. The art world has a concrete base, like centuries old techniques and tools. And it\u2019s this revolution, it\u2019s this renaissance happening right now we are all living in. \n \nBut as an artist, I was so naturally saying this, too, all the time, that I witnessed the birth of internet, web one, web two, web three, AI, quantum. I mean, that\u2019s naturally what I reflect back as a form of imagination. \n \nSo I think there was this rejection for a while, I would say, or blind spot. But then as soon as the more we created works that, you know, bring people together, like our project in Walt Disney Concert Hall, which was also the back-in-time MFA project, thanks to really Lili Cheng, like that she was also like one of the early mentors and advisors. And suddenly, that became a reality that brought 100,000 people together, that became a tangible idea. \n \nOr Casa Batll\u00f3 project in Gaudi\u2019s building in \u2013 in Barcelona, 65,000 people, or at MoMA, our show received 3 million people \u2013\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Incredible.\n \nREFIK ANADOL: \u2013 the largest audience in the MoMA history, with a 38 minutes average viewing. \n \nAnd that all, I think made these tangible results. And as soon as they become an experience in life, a memory, I think that really binded the context into like from a dream to reality.\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So let\u2019s talk about your work. Maybe we can start with one of your more recent things. So like, you have this like, really exciting thing called Dataland that you\u2019re doing. Like, you want to describe that a little bit?\n \nREFIK ANADOL: Yes. So I mean this is like truly the joy project. So first of all, very grateful, again. Over the years as a studio, we thought that last almost 10 years coming, we got so excited about like what else can we do with our knowledge and experience so far? \n  \nSo as I mentioned, we are very grateful. We work with MoMA, Guggenheim, Pompidou. I mean, these are amazing museums in the world. But there\u2019s only a couple of them. But there\u2019s so many artists like myself. \n \nSo number one was like, how can we be sure that this medium, which is very hard to think about, like, I mean, an AI model as a living artwork? Like, I don\u2019t think even museums knows how to preserve an AI model. I mean museums are still discussing how to preserve a painting which is already physically in the world. So there\u2019s like lots of distance from what is coming right now. So we just want to be an example in the field. \n \nAnd second, I really want to like always imagine, like what is the truly and honestly the most complex architectural manifestation of a museum in the age of AI and data and so forth, not necessarily physically, but in this living system that can see us, feel us, have conversations with like, you know, different levels, can do incredible level of computation in real time, and also, you know, curate these beautiful narratives and with neural networks, and doing a great work also for an example for the humanities, such as nature. As I\u2019m a huge lover of nature, I believe that nature is the most important thing we have and the most inspiring thing we have. \n \nHow can we make an AI research by collecting data by ourselves, giving back to the community, open source data exchange, work with the pioneers and also educate AI to the public and even collect the AI work? \n \nSo we found that just a moment this becomes a museum actually, because it\u2019s not only creating art, it is collecting art as sharing, learning and education, and also bringing other artists together. \n \nSo I find that it\u2019s a very incredible and even maybe ways of imagination. So it\u2019s that joy and inspiring place to imagine in Los Angeles, California, opening hopefully next year in a Frank Gehry building. So excited and so happy to, like, join many forces together.\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: It\u2019s really super cool to think about, you know, the community aspect of it. Like, I think it\u2019s truly wonderful. But, you know, like, just technically I want to double-click on preservation. \n \nLike, one of the things, I think, when you and I were younger, there was this idea that because everything was transitioning from analog to digital media, that like, it was going to be so much easier to preserve everything forever. Like, you know, like as soon as the bits were there, like it\u2019s just trivially easy to preserve them. \n \nBut I think we are kind of seeing exactly the opposite. So the bits endure, but like the bits are only useful when you can sort of reduce them onto like a particular set of hardware to, you know, render them in some way to like play back a piece of music or to \u2013 and like your works are like really complicated because they\u2019re these, you know, crazy assemblages of technology. \n  \nAnd so, you know, I do think the preservation challenge just seems to me like really, really daunting because, you know, imagine 100 years from now, like trying to find the hardware to go run the bits on. \n \nREFIK ANADOL: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally agree. And by the way, in our conversations, you mentioned so much beautiful response to the physical, like the joy that you also enjoy physical craftsmanship. And I completely agree with you because by the way, yes, I\u2019m a digital artist, but I love physical world so much. So I didn\u2019t detach from the physical beauty of life, and I feel like it\u2019s a great time still, I think, for us to, like remind us, like how beautiful the physical world. \n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. \n \nREFIK ANADOL: And instead of replacing it or like, you know saying just there\u2019s another alternative world, it\u2019s so beautiful to, like capture the beauty of the world. \n \nAnd I think \u2013 especially I think in pandemic, I asked this question a lot. Like, we could go to nature, but could nature come to us? And that was when I realized that actually, there\u2019s so much we can do. \n \nAnd especially so we are traveling 16 rainforests around the world and working with incredible people living in the forest, such as the Yawanaw\u00e1 people in Amazonia. So they are teaching us like how to live in the forest, for example. Incredible feeling, like when there is no technology that we know around us, but their technology that how they live for thousands of years in the forest. Like, they show us this beautiful species that\u2019s barely known or ever or maybe never like discovered in the Latin or English world. Like there\u2019s so much discovery. \n \nAnd also what I found that as soon as I think the AI models are so inspiring research, and also we learned. So we were able to receive 3.5 million species by asking the museums and institutions who have been preserving them. But the funny thing is, they are incredible silos. I mean, they are independently incredible, but they never merged. \n \nSo we \u2013 what we tried is like, what happens if this intellectually physical world representation comes together, and then suddenly this AI becomes incredibly perfect about nature, and then suddenly it creates this new encyclopedia context. I mean, it\u2019s so funny that something from physical world to the virtual world, but to appreciate the physical world is really so inspiring.\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, yeah, I totally agree. \n \nSo it\u2019s sort of hard to talk about your work because it is so sensual in nature that like, it\u2019s really hard to, you know, have an abstract conversation in English that does it justice. \n \nBut I wonder, you know, maybe to give listeners an idea, you know, maybe you could sort of describe what AI has allowed you to do with a piece of art or like with the making of the art that you couldn\u2019t do before with paint brushes or Photoshop or, you know, you know, whatever the tool set was before. \n \nREFIK ANADOL: Yeah. I think it\u2019s a great question. So it was 2016 when I was very fortunate to work with, very first time, 1.7 million documents, from a library that is mostly cultural documents. And our curator was very much in love with archives. And of course, as an archivist, they always have challenge. For nine years, six researchers have been trying to sort these data. It\u2019s really like challenging. \n \nAnd as soon as we apply a machine learning algorithm, very early embedding models, data synthesis, I was shocked by the result of seeing that 1 million, 1.7 million documents in the form of three-dimensional plottings. This was this moment of like, okay, but this is a new sculpture. But this sculpture is seen through the AI\u2019s mind and applied to human\u2019s mind\u2019s eye by giving those line and points a reasoning that suddenly make that millions of documents visible. \n \nAnd the second question was, of course, if the machine can learn, can it dream? I see these questions all the time in the history, right? Artists ask the question, what is beyond reality? \n \nI mean, that question now with AI, I find that so easier to answer by using a memory context. This can be nature, urban, culture, buildings, cities. I\u2019m so obsessed with all these topics. But I mean, they are topics that belongs to humanity, right? \n \nFor example, nature. We were able to work with 75 million flowers from the Amazonian to like and any creatures exist in the nature and train a model on that. And then suddenly, I have a brush that remembers all the colors of the species, that can paint with infinite possibilities of these beautiful creatures.\n \nSo I see that it\u2019s not so different than Monet back in time, inspired from the atmosphere, but now we have a thinking brush that can, still in the same context, but in different technology. So I see that we have so much similarities.\n \nAnd of course we can go next level there, and this time the artwork can be never the same, which can be a living works by using sensors, you know, weather data, heartbeat, brain signals, and we can give a different context of conversation. \n \nAnd then that can also apply on top of it, by the way, I believe, if one day data becomes a pigment. I don\u2019t think it is dry. It can be non-Newtonian. It can be ever-changing. So I love fluid dynamics so much. In our work we have these small molecules that I am programing them to give a movement context. They can be in any fluidity. They can remember the previous frame. They can \u2013 they will predict the next colors of the frame. So they become this like living, small organisms that are driven by the colors of nature or so forth. \n \nSo \u2013 and plus music that we can also train the model. And then recently we are playing with the scent last four years, like because I felt that we were missing something in those works. And as soon as we introduced the scent molecules, suddenly there is this new form of art, which I\u2019m calling it generative reality. It\u2019s just kind of a new experience that all the time ever changing and living forms of experiences. So it\u2019s fascinating to imagine in this mind space.\n  \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Well, you know, maybe this is a good point to start talking more philosophically about what it is that you\u2019re doing. Like, you\u2019ve already said one thing about art, which is artists are and have historically been searching for things that are outside of reality. Like, you\u2019re making a thing that\u2019s new, new to human experience like.\n \nBut I guess, you know, one of the questions there is why? To what end? You know, and it gets back even to, you know, this thing that we were discussing earlier this year, which is what is art? \n \nBecause, like a lot of people, when a new tool shows up, and it doesn\u2019t need to be AI but AI is the particular tool that we\u2019re discussing right now, they\u2019re like, okay, well, I don\u2019t know what this means. Like, does this mean it\u2019s the end of art? Does it mean that, you know, art is all of a sudden going to become, you know, more vital and different? \n \nAnd it\u2019s happened in every generation. Like, as soon as someone deviates from, you know, what the standard practice is, what the canon is, like everyone\u2019s like, oh my God, like, you know, this is kind of the end. \n \nSo I mean, maybe we should start with that. Like, in your mind, like, why do you do what you do? Like, what is the purpose?\n \nREFIK ANADOL: Incredible aspects and thank you for the question because I always felt that, so first of all, I think to me art is humanity\u2019s capacity of imagination. And I feel that we as humans, we push to the edge of imagination, and that\u2019s what we found there. \n \nAnd I think that\u2019s the quest is I believe in our DNA, in our genes, in our like practice of life and centuries and more. And I think this is, like all evolving with other parts of the life itself. And I think we are all artists. We are all like basically artists. And what we do with our artistic capacity is really just unique and for everyone\u2019s. \n \nAnd I also feel that, to me, art is something when the idea touches both mind and soul at the same time. And I really find that very challenging, actually, because the mind is something we operate in another like reality. We have soul concepts, spirituality and emotions. And as humans, we have so complex like fabric of life. So I feel like art is always intertwining these universes in \u2013 in different and unexpected most unlikely places. \n \nAnd I really got so inspired by the idea of technology for humanity always and always make that a mirror effect. \n  \nBut in this case, AI is the mirror itself. It truly can become an exactly, in my mind at least, the most nearest material I can imagine is a mirror. It really reflects us, our thoughts, our feelings, if you want and if you program it. And it\u2019s the first time we have a technology that has a cognitive capacity, has a reasoning capacity. It\u2019s a fascinating time to be alive to really imagine with this technology. \n \nBut I also feel that, in my mind, my purpose of like as I mentioned, as a child, I never stopped bringing inspiration, joy and hope to life. So that\u2019s always like these layers of imagination and values and belief. \n \nSo I use this technology to make those forms of art, and I believe that was also triggered, this beautiful community around the idea. And also, I felt that sometimes it\u2019s really easy to go like the dark mode in our, like civilization. But I also felt that much harder is what else can we do with that? But like, what else can we like, create and what else can we imagine? So I found myself in that purpose a lot with these beautiful moments. \n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I think I\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot because, you know, people are so energized right now about the intersection of AI and art. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about what, you know, a definition of art is, and I think the only conclusion that I\u2019ve been able to reach, after reading a whole bunch about art history and talking to a bunch of artists, is there really isn\u2019t one definition for art. \n \nYou know, some people have defined it, like you already alluded to this, it\u2019s like art is like what can be collected. You know, so, like, if you can\u2019t like, you know, put something in a gallery or a museum, like, you know, not art. I think that\u2019s a bad definition of art, by the way. \n \nREFIK ANADOL: Absolutely.\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: You know, but it strikes me that there is some, like, really interesting things about art, which is, you know, for me at least, art seems to be a thing that you are trying to express, that there just isn\u2019t another good way to express. And it\u2019s in you and you\u2019ve got to get it out. And like, you must get it out. \n \nAnd, you know, it has value and meaning and worth whether or not anyone else sees it, or, you know, gets to experience it, but it can be enriched when other people experience it, and like, they sort of \u2013 because I think we all sort of seek out art, like we seek out this novelty and like, we look at what other people are expressing to us through their art and try to understand, you know, what is it that they\u2019re trying to express? Like, what did they mean? Like, what does this mean to me? \n  \nAnd so, like, it just feels like this unbelievably human thing. Like, if you sort of take these things out of it, that like you have a human being who has something in them they need to express, and you have another human being who has something in them that like, you know, needs to connect, then, like, I don\u2019t know, like, is it art? \n \nLike, you know, so in a sense, you know, like an AI like making an image that, you know, it shares with another AI, like, you know, maybe that\u2019s art, but I don\u2019t know that I care. \n \nREFIK ANADOL: Yeah, exactly. Totally agree with you. Totally agree. \n \nAnd this moment that you mentioned, the care moment, I feel like it\u2019s exactly where it\u2019s so inspiring because as you mentioned, I think, you know, at the end of the day, I always believe it\u2019s all about being human. I mean, I think that\u2019s, I hope, the common fabric of humanity and our conscious model. \n \nAnd I feel like even yes, you mentioned like maybe multiple AIs can be in conversation. Sure, multiple AIs can do things together. But like, do we have a meaning and purpose there? Like, is it like a new form of imagination versus there\u2019s always this human intellect and quest, right, nature of quest? And I feel like that\u2019s where the super inspiring and infinite possibilities comes in the game. \n \nSo I think the good news, I will say, for the feeling of art making, I agree with you, is this like urgency to create, also like any output, I mean a beautiful food to beautiful music to like poetry to \u2013 and craftsmanship, that I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any limit at all in our, I guess, capacity.\n \nAnd so but that\u2019s just enablers in this case that what we couldn\u2019t play with the reasoning before that we \u2013 I mean, we never have a tool that doesn\u2019t forget before. Like, you know, we have all these, like, amazing breakthroughs back to back for human intellect, right, and  imagination. So I think it\u2019s very inspiring to be alive, to push those new frontiers every single moment. \n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So what are you excited about, like in the next handful of years? Like, what do you hope AI will allow you to do, and like, what do you hope it will allow other people to do artistically?\n \nREFIK ANADOL: Yeah, I think I\u2019m really so inspired by this AI atelier concept. So even though respect to the amazing research with like, you know, incredible resources, incredible minds, but I also like so much about this more atelier mindset where things are relatively humble, relatively small scale maybe, but there\u2019s still some this discovery and innovations that where, you know, like, for example, we are right now working with incredible datasets about some heroes like Frank Gehry, for example, for Guggenheim Museum. So we are experimenting like much smaller domain imaginations, maybe. \n  \nBut there is so much beauty in that more smaller scale data sets. But try to find what else can we like reimagine in this space? And definitely multimodality is so inspiring, sound, image, video, text, but also scent. As soon as we brought the scent together, and there is this memory lane that just never opened before, and it\u2019s so fascinating. \n \nAnd the other part I am so inspired recently is really like this Dataland especially like, how can we go beyond? I mean, first of all, I respect that now the language becomes a software, which is incredible, and it\u2019s a new form of imagination. But now I\u2019m expressing what happens beyond the language, like what happens? Like at the MoMA project, we try to prompt the work through the camera of the movement of the people or the loudness of the space or the weather data. \n \nSo now we are experimenting with this, you know, fun ways of what else can we truly, poetically explore, the language of nature that turns into beautiful artworks that are still reflecting different modalities of nature. I will say obsession with finding the language of nature, I will say, through these neural networks and possibilities. \n \nAnd then lastly, I hope to help other artist friends, because it\u2019s really what I see that it\u2019s beautiful to have these incredible tools, but they are the breakthroughs, right? They are the breakthroughs. That means that artists sometimes want a new breakthrough to make a new breakthrough in art form. So can we help and imagine new collective compute? That\u2019s like I\u2019m really inspired about, like how can we achieve this collective unlocking for more smaller scale imaginations?\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: And do you think the tools are getting democratized fast enough for artists? Because I\u2019m guessing one of the things that you had to overcome is like the tools, at least in the beginning and maybe this is still true now, I\u2019m guessing it is, like are still technically more complicated than they need to be. \n \nREFIK ANADOL: Yeah.\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Which can make them inaccessible.\n \nREFIK ANADOL: I mean, first of all, I mean, absolutely yes. I mean, first of all, it must have a GitHub user. Like, it must have like, open source culture person. I learn from open source culture, huge respect and love for the field, and a massive like respect to the current tools that now we can really quickly. I mean, I\u2019m literally \u2013 you know, half of our team is saying always like, okay, copilot every \u2013 I mean, imagine of the productivity of the friends in the studio that just as programmers that improved last one and a half year. Remarkable. Like, we feel so empowered and not any more feeling behind or lack of knowledge. I mean, that feeling is turning into this beautiful creativity. It\u2019s incredible. The joy is incredible. And that\u2019s a huge respect and love for the community, for sharing. And that\u2019s why we also try to share through our humble experiments. \n  \nAnd I\u2019m so happy to say that it\u2019s so accessible. I mean, now accessing an AI model is relatively cheaper than a book. I mean, that\u2019s fascinating. I mean, that is just the beautiful knowledge base that is there for you, for, you know, for a while it is accessible very much easily. And that\u2019s, I think, fascinating because this makes people, I will say, more equal to have access to knowledge and experience and with reasoning. So I\u2019m so happy to say that that\u2019s a beautiful, positive path of, I think, human intellect with AI. \n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and I think it is interesting that there is this open source community of people out there, because I think a challenge to it with a new toolset is if you want to be in \u2013 if you want to be a painter, you go to the art store, you buy some tubes of paint, you buy some brushes, you buy a canvas, and like, you can start painting. Like, you probably won\u2019t be any good in the beginning, but like, you can get started relatively easily. And like, that pattern is so well understood and has been for so long, that like, there just isn\u2019t any confusion about how to go get started. \n \nAnd so, I think it\u2019s just super important, like what you\u2019re doing to try to share learnings and to contribute back, you know, data and tools and all of the building blocks that you need to add AI to your \u2013 like, your toolkit and your creative repertoire. Like, it\u2019s just super, super important.\n \nREFIK ANADOL: Thank you. And it really makes beautiful conversations. And again, huge respect for complex systems, but this is all about like more smaller systems and like, really demystify them. \n \nAnd by the way, there is something I found so great that so last eight years, as soon as we have an installation using AI and data, we always put the process wall, which we call it process or video or something, or process artwork, where we demystify the name of the algorithm, the people who researched for it, where data comes from and so on. \n \nAs soon as we put this demystification, I guess, artworks next to the artwork itself, it\u2019s so remarkable to make this safe and secure space for the public, that I think they get much more and much more, much more involved. \n \nAnd this really makes me much more make it grounded that we should just do it more. And then the more we do it in an atelier and education context \u2013 again, as a professor, I can\u2019t stop that part of the world. It really creates a beautiful space.\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. Well, look, you know, I would highly, highly encourage you to do more of that because, like, sometimes, like, I\u2019m such an engineering dork. \n  \nSometimes I actually like the view into the process more than I like even the, you know, the thing that comes out of the other end of it. And like, and I can love the thing that came, but I\u2019m just fascinated by the process. Like, how on earth did these people make the things that they made? It\u2019s just fascinating.\n \nREFIK ANADOL: Totally. And again, huge respect to your work. And Kevin, like, I cannot imagine how it can be things can be very, you know, complex systems and engineering and imagination. And it\u2019s so now I feel that because of the AI tools that are allowing, you know, people, curious minds.\n \nLike, I mean, in the beginning, I don\u2019t know how much it resonates, but I remember opening the like, you know, inside of a radio, of early TVs, that like, you know, just dismantle the system and try to look at, like, how it works, right? I mean, the similar mindset that, I mean, now we can apply to the incredible systems and so forth. It\u2019s really, really it\u2019s just similar mindset, but just in different time of the domain, I guess.\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, yeah, for sure. And look, I think it\u2019s everywhere. Like, I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019ve been doing \u2013 doing a bunch of ceramics work for the past I guess it\u2019s been about nine months now, and \u2013\n \nREFIK ANADOL: Fascinating.\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, it\u2019s super fascinating, and it\u2019s like one of the oldest crafts, oldest art forms that humanity has because it was like one of these ancient necessities that people needed. You needed, you know, cups to drink out of and plates to eat on and pots to cook in. \n \nBut it really is, like the whole process of it is just endlessly fascinating, and still, you know, even though \u2013 like, this is the thing that gives me real hope about AI and art. Like, you can even have a thing like ceramics that every culture on earth has been practicing for millennia, and like, you can still have novelty and innovation and creativity and people, you know, saying new things through this medium that have not been said before, that resonate in ways that have never resonated before. And so, if it\u2019s true for that, like I \u2013 it definitely will be true for like this new medium. \n \nREFIK ANADOL: Yeah. I completely agree. And I had, as we discussed, in that amazing event also, I was very fortunate also I met with four years ago a young Yawanaw\u00e1 artist in the forest, that they\u2019ve been painting with this technique called their Kano\u00ea is their graphical language in the forest, that they took the pigments from the nature and then transform certain species into certain colors, mostly red and black, and they have these incredible reds and blues from \u2013 I have no idea how they create this, but they were like, you know, paint these beautiful things. \n \nAnd we were able to train a model, as they requested to join forces, and we were still like, enjoy so much how, as you mentioned, beautiful there for hundreds of years of like practice still relevant. \n \nAnd also, as you said, like I really felt the same thing when we train these artworks for their village to raise funding to make their first museum and schools. By the way, this February, hopefully, there will be 1,000 \u2013\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome.\n \nREFIK ANADOL: \u2013 spiritual leaders in the forest to celebrate their life in the forest. \n \nSo that\u2019s where I felt completely like how beautiful the physical context, but gracefully and ethically connect with the virtual world and imagination and turn it into a value back to the communities. It\u2019s a fascinating feeling.\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: It\u2019s awesome. Super, super cool stuff that you\u2019re doing. \n \nSo maybe one last question before you go. And I ask this of everyone who comes on the show, and it\u2019s always a hard question because everybody who comes on the podcast does really fascinating stuff. \n \nSo outside of the thing that you do in your professional life, what do you do for fun?\n \nREFIK ANADOL: Oh, great. So I have a huge, huge true joy with my wife. And together we have been traveling across the world. So she is our compass, like discovering new cultures, new places. It\u2019s truly a joy of travel to, like, you know, lower the barriers of, like, borders and so forth, like, truly like travel across the world. It\u2019s a beautiful journey in life that, like really opens up how incredible the world is and also how incredible the humanity is, like really understand that diversity. And so, that\u2019s really a joy. \n \nAnd on top of that, it\u2019s kind of a mix with work, but I really, truly \u2013 my life truly changed when I live in the forest for several weeks in Amazonia, There is this infinite, beautiful quest there, and it\u2019s really beautiful to see people of a forest that have their own beautiful way of living, to culture, to technology. Like really understanding who they are is very special. And I really hope everyone in life can visit and feel the true joy of living in the forest. It\u2019s something I can promise life changing in the most positive way. So that\u2019s a joy of fun.\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: That\u2019s amazing. Well, thank you so much for taking time out of a busy schedule to chat with us today. and just so inspired by what it is you\u2019re doing and can\u2019t wait to see you do more of it.\n \nREFIK ANADOL: No, Kevin, thank you so much. There was so many incredible people with you here, and I\u2019m honored to be here. And thank you for the incredible questions and time. \n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Awesome.\n \n[MUSIC]\nKEVIN SCOTT: All right. What a great conversation with Refik Anadol. I think, you heard him say over and over and over again, this word imagination. And I don't know many people who have a more extraordinary imagination than Refik does. So I think he has a really boundless curiosity and a kind of creative fearlessness. \nYou know, despite whatever daunting technical obstacles there might be, like he can see the possibility in these new tools like AI and couple them with a really amazing creative vision to do stuff that I think really does actually speak to a huge number of people. You know, you just sort of given the large audiences that have been through some of his bigger installations and you know what the critical reception and the popular reception have been to his work. It's just really extraordinary. \nAnd I think he's so early in his career and so early in really utilizing the full possibility of these tools that he's a pioneer of that, you know, there's going to be years of really extraordinary work coming out of him and his team in the future. So it was a real joy and privilege to be able to chat with him today. \nSo I think that is all for today. I want to again, thank Refik Anadol so much for joining us. \n \nRemember, you can send me your questions to BehindTheTech at Microsoft.com and please check out the show notes for a few of those people and organizations in North Carolina who need your help.
