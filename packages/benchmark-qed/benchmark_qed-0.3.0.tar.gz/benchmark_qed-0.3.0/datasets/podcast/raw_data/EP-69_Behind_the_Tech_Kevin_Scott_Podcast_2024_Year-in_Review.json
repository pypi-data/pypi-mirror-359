{"episode": "EP-69 Behind the Tech Kevin Scott Podcast 2024 Year-in Review", "text": "CHRISTINA WARREN: Welcome to Behind the Tech. I'm your co-host, Christina Warren, Senior Developer Advocate at GitHub.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: and I'm Kevin Scott.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And it is that time of year once again for our year in review episode. So obviously this past year, AI was a huge part of the conversations. Like probably every single episode we did either touched on AI or dug in really deep into what's happening in AI right now, or some of the really exciting possibilities that is opening up as we see it out in the world now for a year and a half, maybe two years, almost two years.\n\nBut maybe the most exciting thing that we got to look at with AI this year was how it connected to creativity, especially in music and art.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I mean, I, I mean, this is of very high personal interest to me. I think there is this beautiful thread of creativity that goes through what we all do, whether we're an engineer, an artist, a teacher, you know, just sort of pick your profession, everybody has to be creative in their own unique way.\n\nAnd it's been really exciting for me to see how this new tool that we're building, Generative AI and the infrastructure that surrounds it is being used in such phenomenal ways to support that creative impulse that everybody has. Just last month, we talked to Refik Anadol, who is creating these incredible, huge art installations using datasets of everything from weather patterns to heartbeats.\n\nREFIK ANADOL: digital artists like myself, the movement that\u2019s enjoying computation, games and creativity with AI and so forth, we were the blind spot for the museums and galleries, super honestly. And it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s quantifiable for many reasons, because it\u2019s a new movement. It\u2019s a new reaction to the like field. The art world has a concrete base, like centuries old techniques and tools. And it\u2019s this revolution, it\u2019s this renaissance happening right now we are all living in. \n \nBut as an artist, I was so naturally saying this, too, all the time that I witnessed the birth of internet, web one, web two, web three, AI, quantum. I mean, that\u2019s naturally that \u2013 that\u2019s what I reflect back as a form of imagination. \n \nSo I think there was this rejection for a while, I would say, or \u2013 or blind spot. But then as soon as the more we created works that, you know, bring people together, like our project in Walt Disney Concert Hall, which was also the back-in-time MFA project, thanks to really Lili Cheng, like that she was also like one of the early mentors and advisors. And suddenly, that became a reality that brought 100,000 people together, that became a tangible idea. \n \nOr Casa Batll\u00f3 project in Gaudi\u2019s building in \u2013 in Barcelona, 65,000 people, or at MoMA, our show received 3 million people \u2013\n \nKEVIN SCOTT: Incredible.\n \nREFIK ANADOL: \u2013 the largest audience in the MoMA history, with a 38 minutes average viewing. \n \nAnd that all, I think made these tangible results. And as soon as they become an experience in life, a memory, I think that really binded the context into like from a dream to reality.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Refik's work is so incredible. It lets you see what it can mean for AI and humans to truly collaborate. Really, the AI can process and interpret a volume of data that's just ways beyond a human's capacity. But the human is, I think as Refik puts it, is then getting to use that data as a paintbrush, which I think is really beautiful.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, and this is where I get so excited about this moment right now that we're living through seeing this explosion of creativity that's happening with people like Refik. And I just love to hear the ways that artists are thinking about this, just fascinated by the creative process and, you know, obviously the engineering process of these things. Not everybody might know this about me, but I'm a huge classical piano nerd, and a couple episodes ago I got to really dig into this with a fellow piano nerd, Ben Laude.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I want to talk about the \u2013 I want to talk about the\u2026 you know, the instrument and the art as, like, you know two different things, because I think, you know, when you think about something like AI, like, if you think about, you know, AI as both instrument and art together, like, you just are getting confused. But if you think about AI as an instrument for an artist to use to go make something, it becomes altogether interesting.\nAnd so, I was watching this morning, Murray Perahia doing a master class in 2022 on the G minor Ballade, Chopin, which is my favorite piece of music. And Murray, like, one of his performances is my very favorite performance of that. And, you know, there\u2019s a \u2013 you know, the part of that ballade that is \u2013 that moves me the most is, like, the lead up to bar 106, you know? So, like, you know, when you release all of the tension, it\u2019s like that double fortissimo. It\u2019s the big dramatic moment in the middle of the piece. \nAnd what he was asking this student to do is, like, there\u2019s this chord in the lead up to 106. And he\u2019s like, \u201cWhat does death sound like?\u201d (Laughter.) And he\u2019s like, \n\u201cThis is death.\u201d And he\u2019s like, you know, \u201cYou need to, like, have this passage, this line that you\u2019re playing, you know, like, be foreboding and, like, as if death is chasing you.\u201d\nAnd not everybody has that in their mind, like, when they\u2019re playing that particular passage.\nBEN LAUDE: It\u2019s also interesting that there\u2019s almost no spoilers in classical music. It\u2019s almost the reverse. It\u2019s knowing what\u2019s coming that builds the anticipation and the goosebumps. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes!\nBEN LAUDE: And for me, it\u2019s knowing a piece really well that makes, if it\u2019s a great piece, that makes repeated listenings so meaningful. But yeah, it\u2019s interesting to compare what you\u2019re describing to AI. And you would know much more about this than I would, but at least from what I can tell, classical piano and the literature and the art of interpreting it, I mean, these are expressions of human consciousness. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yes.\nBEN LAUDE: And Chopin\u2019s first Ballade is an expression of his organized consciousness, and he\u2019s expressing something. And the only way we can agree about the piece is if we just speak in generalities. Well, it\u2019s dramatic. It seems to tell a story, whatever. But the moment you get into details and you want to talk about how this phrase should be rendered, it\u2019s death for Murray Perahia. It\u2019s life affirming for somebody else. It\u2019s dark for this interpreter. It\u2019s bright. I mean, it\u2019s dry for Glenn Gould, it\u2019s wet for Horowitz, right? It\u2019s \u2013 suddenly the interpreter\u2019s consciousness is then mixed with the composer\u2019s, and you get a new cocktail of whatever thing we can\u2019t describe, you know? \n\nAnd, yeah, I mean, maybe one day we will be sort of comparing Horowitz and Perahia\u2019s Chopin Ballade to AI\u2019s different version of it. And we can input, well, I want to hear an AI sort of play it with this kind of expression. I don\u2019t know. I mean, I\u2019m not \u2013 you might have a comment on that. Is that coming? Should we be concerned, or what do you think? \nKEVIN SCOTT: No, no. Look, I\u2019ve had this conversation with people, and I don\u2019t think it does, because I think the point of a thing like classical piano is you have something inside of you that you\u2019re trying to express that\u2019s difficult or impossible to express any other way. And it\u2019s, like, part of, you know, your humanity. And you are \u2013 you know, it has meaning if you just play it for yourself, and it has a different meaning if you play it for an audience, who are going to receive it in probably a different way than you are maybe even intending when you play it. \nBEN LAUDE: Right.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Like, I\u2019d never thought of death before hearing Murray\u2019s performance until I saw him teach that master class. So, like, that\u2019s not the thing I\u2019m thinking of. It\u2019s like, you know, just this incredible emotional response that I get to it that I can\u2019t really put words on. And, like, I think that\u2019s a beautiful connection that, you know, you\u2019ve made, even though maybe that\u2019s not even what he was intending to do.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Okay, let's talk a little bit about another one of your passions, which is learning and education. And this is another place where I think AI is kind of breaking the field wide open and potentially really transforming the way we think about it. And you know, and of course, when we talk about AI and education, that kind of the first instinct for many folks is to worry about cheating. That's where everybody's mind always goes. But I think so many of our guests this year have really helped bring a different perspective to the conversation.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, absolutely. It was super cool that we got to talk with Sal Khan about this. He's the founder of Khan Academy and definitely a person who's been leading the way in online education for many years now.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I think one of the, you know, interesting things about Generative AI in education is some people\u2019s kneejerk reaction to it has been, oh, my God, like, this thing is bad, like let\u2019s get it out of the classrooms, it\u2019s just going to help students cheat. And like, you\u2019ve got a very different take on it, like, I think, you know, informed by all of the leverage work that you\u2019ve been trying to do over the years with the core of Khan Academy. So talk about that a little bit.\nSAL KHAN: Yeah, big picture, even broader than education, technology just amplifies human intent. And if your intent is to be evil, you will find ways to make the technology evil. If your intent is to be lazy, you\u2019ll find ways that technology can empower your laziness. But if you want to learn, or if you want to help people learn, there\u2019s always ways that technology can be valuable. You know, the same video technology that might, you know, have people watch not so great stuff, we can also use to teach them. And so, it\u2019s all about how do you mitigate the harms and maximize the benefits. \nAnd I tell everyone who is a well-intentioned person, just checking out and running the other way, that just means only the bad folks or the lazy folks are going to be using technology, especially now with these very powerful technologies like generative AI. \nAnd so, it\u2019s obvious things like teaching \u2013 cheating, and then, you know, there\u2019s issues sometimes with AI potentially around maybe bias, errors, hallucinations. What if students want to use it for unproductive ends, they want to, you know, help making a bomb or something like that or they want to harm themselves. \nSo what I told our team at Khan Academy is like, look, those aren\u2019t reasons not to work with Generative AI. Those are reasons to just put guardrails around it and turn those into features. Let\u2019s make it so the teacher can see what the students are doing if they\u2019re under 18. Let\u2019s make it so our AI doesn\u2019t cheat, but it can Socratically nudge you in the right direction. \nLet\u2019s make it so that we can support students in, say, writing an essay, making the student do the work, but acting as an ethical writing coach. And if the student goes to ChatGPT or someplace else to get their essay written for them and brings it into our system, then our system, when it talks to the teacher, is going to say, well, you know, Kevin and I didn\u2019t work on this essay together. And by the way, it\u2019s not consistent with his other writing. We should double-click on whether Kevin really did this work. So I actually think the AI can actually be used to undermine AI cheating itself. \nSo any tool can be used for good or for bad. And so, that\u2019s kind of like the big theme of the book. Here\u2019s all of the ways that it can be used w aell, here\u2019s all of the fears and risks that people have, but here\u2019s how we should mitigate those and actually turn them into benefits.\nKEVIN SCOTT: So, you know, maybe last couple of questions here. So what is your advice for people, as they\u2019re sort of thinking about maybe not even just AI, but like, you know, we have an interesting future headed our way because some technologies like AI are developing like really, really quickly. \nYou know, you have done a really tremendous job in your career using technology to, like, help yourself. You know, so like, computer sciences was your gateway into, you know, big Silicon Valley companies and startups and, like, eventually into, like, a hedge fund. Like, technology is sitting at the center of this nonprofit that you\u2019ve created, is having big impact. Like, what\u2019s your advice to people you know, for the future?\nSAL KHAN: You know, my advice is, and I write about this in the book, you know, there\u2019s people who think, \u201coh, well, the calculator exists, kids don\u2019t need to know arithmetic. Or computers exist, you know, it\u2019s one less thing that you have to learn how to do. The internet exists, search exists; you don\u2019t have to learn knowledge anymore.\u201d And now with AI, people are like, well, \u201cdo people even need to learn how to write?\u201d etcetera. But I always point out, if you look at any of these inflection points of technology, it has accrued the most benefit to the people with the deepest skills. \nAnd so, I think the answer is this is a reason to double down on, for sure, the traditional skills, the math, the reading and the writing, but also now augment that so that you learn how to creatively use these tools that can really amplify you, I mean, giving you almost godlike powers to do things that, you know, would have looked like science fiction even five, 10 years ago. \nSo \u2013 and I also write in the book, like this isn\u2019t like a nice-to-have. It\u2019s an imperative now because the status quo, unfortunately, most people aren\u2019t going to be in a position to leverage the AI because the AI is better than...you know, we\u2019re already seeing the AI is operating at the 80th percentile of the LSAT. Like, I would be worried if I was a 50th percentile lawyer\u2013 of where this is going. Now, if I\u2019m a 1 percentile lawyer, I know that there\u2019s certain things, yeah, the AI can help me draft a contract, etcetera, but I have certain expertise. I\u2019ve fought certain cases. I know the nuances that no AI can have. You\u2019re going to be superpowered. You\u2019re going to be able to get the AI to write your contracts. Maybe you\u2019ll hire fewer paralegals or whatever. But your expertise is going to be magnified even more. While if all you could do is draft a boilerplate contract, you\u2019re going to be in trouble. \nSo more people \u2013 I think, you know, the job market is going to broadly become kind of bipolar. The knowledge economy, if you want to be in the knowledge economy, and that\u2019s probably where the bulk of the value of AI is going to accrue, you need to upskill even more. And hopefully maybe you can use AI to help you get there, use Khanmigo, use, you know Khan Academy. \nI think there\u2019s also you know, people shouldn\u2019t panic. I think even if you can\u2019t be a 1% lawyer, I also think there\u2019s going to be a lot of, let\u2019s call it very human work, that as we have a more abundant society, we should have more resources so that we can have, you know, more caregivers, more people to fight loneliness, more people to, you know, provide help to the sick or to the elderly, whatever. So I think there\u2019s actually going to probably be work there, too.\nCHRISTINA WARREN: And here's maybe an interesting behind the scenes tidbit for listeners here. We actually used Copilot as we were starting to put this year in review episode together. And it was able to identify some of the high level themes that came up all over with our guests this year. And that's a lot like the ways that educators like Sal Khan talk about using AI. And it's this idea of co-intelligence, which was certainly one of the themes that came up over and over again. And it's something that you talked about with Ethan Mollick, who's a professor at the Wharton School.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I really appreciate the way Ethan super clearly talks about this.\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: So at least at the current stage, AI really works like a form of co-intelligence. Like, it is a booster to your activities. It is a threat to some parts of your job, but not the parts you want to do. And it is something that is usable right now. \nAnd I think a lot of people and a lot of the books about AI have tended to focus on future, and especially sort of scary versus, you know, like, are we all saved or all doomed? And I think that that is an important conversation, but in some ways, the least interesting conversation to have about AI that\u2019s already here. \nAnd it\u2019s fascinating because when you talk to people who are using it, they want to talk about how to use it. It feels like the 80s again, right? Like, people want to figure out what are the tips. They\u2019re exchanging information. There\u2019s excitement in the air among users. \nAnd I think that I wanted to try and bring that conversation to people and give people ways of getting started. And also to realize, like, this is kind of a big deal, right? It\u2019s a big deal in lots of ways that we would never have expected AI to be a big deal. And it\u2019s a big deal right now. Like, it out-innovates most innovators. It out-writes most writers. Like, you know, elite consultants, it does a really good job. Like, this is weird stuff that is going to have weird effects. And it is accessible. And that\u2019s part of why it\u2019s gonna have such a weird effect.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: So let's bring this conversation back into the physical world for a moment here. Maybe we're just going through all of your hobbies and obsessions, which we love having. But the next one is the world of makers on YouTube. And earlier this year, we talked with Xyla Foxlin.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I was so excited to talk with, with Xyla. She makes just the most incredible stuff. And I think she's also obsessed with learning and education and really breaking open the ways we traditionally think about how we learn.\n\nXYLA FOXLIN: I think that when I was a kid, it was sort of like you were interested in engineering or you were interested in art. And it was a little bit gender segregated, but it was also just like those were separate categories. And the maker movement has kind of combined the two.  \n\nXYLA FOXLIN: I was never good at classroom learning. I have to physically do something to really understand it, or I have to apply something to a project, and then I\u2019ll like, really understand why or how something works.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: But you know, if a kid gets a chance, whatever brings the chance, but if they get the chance to discover that they are interested in and good enough at something where they just want to go put the work in, like you were talking about before, where you just get better and better and better \u2013\nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah.\nKEVIN SCOTT: \u2013 like that virtuous cycle is sort of the most important thing in the world. \nAnd like the thing that \u2013 the thing that is so unfortunate is how often kids don\u2019t even get a chance to get on the trailhead, like, they just don\u2019t \u2013 you know, like they don\u2019t have your wonderful fifth grade teacher or, you know, like my bad parenting and Grey\u2019s Anatomy. And like, they just don\u2019t figure out that, like, hey, here\u2019s the hook. And that, you know, hard things are hard, like \u2013 but, like, you\u2019ve just got to be interested enough to, like,  go do the work to get good. \nXYLA FOXLIN: Yeah, and they have to be in, like, a safe enough environment where they can try things and they can fail. And I think most school systems are not like that. And so, it takes like a family environment or a really special teacher, like you said, to create that environment. And it\u2019s just so hard to do en masse. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I guess it is with math like hard because the way that we grade mathematics is like, you know, there\u2019s a right and a wrong answer to a problem. And if you get it wrong, like oftentimes you don\u2019t get an awful lot of feedback about what to do to get better. And then you just see the bad score at the end, and it\u2019s like, okay, well, I\u2019m bad at this, which is like wrong.\nXYLA FOXLIN: Right. Like it feels very black and white. Until you get up to like, calculus or even pre-calc, where now you\u2019re having \u2013 or geometry actually is a great one where, like you start \u2013 you could get halfway through proving a theorem or you can kind of get most of the way there, and then it feels like there\u2019s some kind of progress. It\u2019s not like a multiplication problem where you either got it right or you got it wrong. But you have to get through that hump.\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, I think, too, with math, like I get frustrated with how we teach it because we sort of very frequently introduce the mathematical concepts, absent any kind of motivation for why this thing is important. And like, that\u2019s not how the mathematical concepts are invented. I mean, there\u2019s some things in, you know, pure mathematics that, you know, get invented just for the sake of the math. But like most math got invented because somebody was trying to solve a problem, and like, they needed a way to model something in the real world or, you know. \nXYLA FOXLIN: Right. Yeah.\nKEVIN SCOTT: And like, we just don\u2019t do a good job sharing that with kids early. Unless you have an exceptional teacher. \nXYLA FOXLIN: Right, right. But even an exceptional teacher is working within the bounds of the fact that they\u2019re like, teaching math class. And then the students are going to leave class and go to English class. And they\u2019re going to leave class and go to like science class. And there\u2019s only so much, at least in my experience, there\u2019s only so much the math and the science teachers can do to make their curriculums match up, especially if you\u2019re trying to meet state regulations and state requirements for testing and stuff. \nYeah, I think even in engineering school, when you think like the whole curriculum is designed to be applied to the real world, the math was still so separate. \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. So you got through the gauntlet. \nXYLA FOXLIN: I did. Barely.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Okay, so while we're still here in the physical world, we also got to talk with someone who is deeply connected with the physical hardware that powers everything that we do in the virtual world. Your conversation with Lisa Su of AMD was fantastic and really got into some of those questions about the physical world and hardware versus software.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, Lisa was teasing me a little bit about the different paths she and I have taken and this like classical, sometimes almost comical tension between hardware and software people.\n\nLISA SU: No offense. Software is very interesting, but at the time, hardware was much more sexy to me, and I had the opportunity to see how you could, you know, build chips, and build, you know, they weren\u2019t the most advanced chips in the world, but to me, it was like amazing. It was amazing that you could build, you know, some transistors on something the size of a coin. You could look at it in the microscope. You could measure it on a test system, and you know, that\u2019s how I got into hardware, and that\u2019s how I got into semiconductors, actually. \n  \nLISA SU: it\u2019s so important to see the results of what you\u2019re doing, and you know, I love the fact that I can build products that I can touch and feel, and you know, walk into Best Buy and see those products, or walk into your data center and see those products, so that\u2019s what I enjoy.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So something that's just so honestly mind boggling about the moment that we're in right now is how these tools are not just adding a little bit onto our past capabilities, but they're multiplying and transforming what's possible. We talked to Mike Volpi about this.\n\nMIKE VOLPI: humans are in some sense the pinnacle of biological technology. Like we are, as far as we know, at the top of the pyramid of biological technology. And I felt like a system that would not copy it, but attempted to emulate how humans worked, and did so via computer system, had to have a really, really bright future. Like it just was sort of like saying the horse is the best instrument we have to move around. If I only could build a mechanical system that mimicked a horse, I could actually improve productivity a lot. And somebody invented a car, right?  And in the same way, like a human is the best brain system that we know of. And if you try to, you know, like a car is not a horse. They\u2019re very different instruments, but they serve a similar purpose.  And that\u2019s at least how I think of AI, which is actually AI systems don\u2019t really work like the human brain. They sort of loosely, but they serve the same benefit at the end. They just, because of the nature of scaling and computing, they can be much bigger.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: So maybe last couple of questions. What do you think is interesting going forward, either in AI or, you know, like anything else that\u2019s sort of happening in technology that you think is interesting, that people ought to be paying more attention to than they are?\nMIKE VOLPI: Look, I think there\u2019s a couple things in the AI side that I pay attention to. One is the physical embodiment of AI, which is interesting. I think the AI we experience through Bing Chat or ChatGPT or Cohere or whatever is the purely digital experience right now. \nAnd I think that, you know, we are analog beings, and at some level there needs to be a physical experience associated with that of some variety. So whether it\u2019s, you know, robotics or it\u2019s devices or, you know, other things that allow a more physical embodiment of what we perceive to be AI, I think is super interesting. \nI do pay attention to technologies other than transformers. I think this is an investor bias. I don\u2019t see how investors can, you know, startup investors can win in transformers now anymore because of the capital requirements of it. And I would say for now, there is no obvious scaling boundaries to transformers, but maybe there might be. And if so, might there be a different approach? \nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah.\nMIKE VOLPI: Maybe, maybe not. But it\u2019s my job to explore.\nKEVIN SCOTT: And for listeners who may not be AI people, like when we \u2013 when Mike is saying transformers, he\u2019s not talking about Optimus Prime. Like, this is the \u2013 \nMIKE VOLPI: Oh yes.\nKEVIN SCOTT: This is the prevailing architecture for deep neural networks that is basically driving all of this crazy scale-based progress right now.\nMIKE VOLPI: Yeah, exactly. I mean, everything that everybody experiences today in AI is largely based on this technology called transformers. And it has very good scaling characteristics, meaning that, you know, if you throw more computing power at it, it just gets better and better and better. \nThat\u2019s not generally true with technology. Technology usually has a plateauing effect. Like, you can throw more resources at it, but the pace at which it improves flattens over time. And this particular technology has not shown characteristics of flattening so far. \nBut it also means that the resources required get massive. So it needs a lot of power, a lot of computers, a lot of data centers, all that stuff. Very hard for a small company to survive.\n\n\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: It's really exciting to start to think about and imagine what all the creative people out there are going to do with this stuff in the next few, say five or 10 years.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Yeah, and like that makes me think of something that Ethan Mollick said that I think he had a really great way of thinking about this.\n\nETHAN MOLLICK: And the model I always think about is the Industrial Revolution, and in the way people don\u2019t usually think about, which is steam power came to a lot of factories in England at the same kind of time. The ones that won were not \u2013 were not the ones that were like, hey, we could still make pots, but with less people. Those companies got destroyed, right? The ones that succeeded were the ones we can now use the same number of people and make 10,000 more pots and ship them all over the world, right?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah, absolutely. That's the metaphor we should be thinking about. And let's bring in one more guest here, Mike Schroepfer. Schrep talks about technology as leverage.\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: I love the idea of leverage. I mean, technology is leverage. You know, I would always say that technology is one of those few things that - that - that removes constraints. So many problems in life, you know, if you\u2019ve ever, like, the Economics 101 you take in high school or it\u2019s like, all right, you have $100 city budget. You know, you can either fund the libraries or the police or the fire department, but you can\u2019t fund all three fully. Like, a lot of people live in a world every day where our problems are tradeoffs. I can do this or I can do that. And technology is one of the only things that\u2019s like, oh, hey, it\u2019s now half the price.\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. It\u2019s really interesting, I think there\u2019s a related thing with smart people where sometimes it\u2019s very enjoyable to wallow in complexity to, like, take a very hard thing, and like even to make it harder, and like, there\u2019s this joy you can get from \u2013 from spending cycles there. But like, those overly complicated things are almost never really useful.\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: A hundred percent. I think \u2013 I often describe when I\u2019m working with people \u2013 I \u2013 this took me a long time to figure out, but I think there\u2019s complex-ifiers and there are simplifiers. There\u2019s someone you give a big, hard problem, they go, like, \"Here\u2019s 30 pages, but you really only need to understand 3 things.\" Like, \"Here\u2019s the three biggest things that matter here, and if you want to get into details, I got it, but like here\u2019s the thing.\" \n\nThere\u2019s other people that come out with, \"Here\u2019s 26 pages of detail. I\u2019ve covered every base on this thing.\" And you\u2019re like, \"That\u2019s not actually helpful. That\u2019s actually much a worse.\" And like, I find simplifiers are a secret weapon of a lot of organizations. It\u2019s what we sought in our PMs at Meta. That\u2019s what I look for in the founders I back. And it, like repeatedly has been successful for me in finding people who take a big, complex gnarly thing, and say, \"But these are the only things that matter.\u201d\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Yeah. I mean, I feel like you\u2019re giving the listeners sage advice here, so like, you compound these things and they get very interesting. So folks who have high learning rate, who know how to, like, experiment quickly, who are simplifiers, like, you just sort of stack these together, and like those, really the union of those things are just superpowers.\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: Yeah, a hundred percent. \n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: Okay, so Kevin, if you had to sum up all of these amazing conversations that we've had over the podcast this year and think about this moment in technology, what comes up for you?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: I think it's really clear at this point that we're in a moment of platform shift. It's not just that technology is becoming incrementally faster or more efficient or cheaper. It's very dramatically changing and breaking apart the ways we operate, whether that's in creative things, software, medicine, everyday life, education. And I think it presents some really exciting opportunities to address big thorny complicated challenges like climate change. Let's play one last clip from Shrep here, because I think he put it really well.\n\nMIKE SCHROEPFER: Climate is this thing that\u2019s going - it\u2019s a platform problem. It\u2019s going to impact tens or hundreds of millions of people, and the people most impacted are the least equipped to deal with the impacts. And so, it\u2019s like, here I am with a bunch of resources. Like, isn\u2019t it just an obligation for me to go off and do this?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: Hearing that, thinking about the things I'm thinking and seeing and learning, it leaves me feeling hopeful about what's coming next.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: So I've got to ask you, are you going to make any New Year's resolutions, any predictions for what's coming in 2025?\n\nKEVIN SCOTT: God, that's so hard. think, you know, one of the one of the mistakes that, you know, maybe it's hubris that we all make is just being quick with the predictions. You know, I think the thing that's just super clear is the AI platform shift will keep rolling. And I think if anything, we'll pick up speed. I sort of look at the time that we're recording this like we've got brand new models that have hit the hands of developers like O1 that are just extraordinary leaps forward in capability. And I'm already seeing the amazing things that people are doing as soon as they get access to that. And so, you know, the year ahead, we will have even more capable models coming and we will have more exciting things that people are doing with it. you know, I think given that some of the\n\nAI applications are kind of trailing indicators of where the model capability actually is that, like next year we're going to start seeing some really incredible things happen that have just taken, you know, a while, a couple of years to sort of percolate through the, you know, through the system and get ready to launch and have wide scale impact. So I think it's going to be a super exciting year. And, know, like my personal new year's resolution is to try to continue every day to come in, learn something new, about how people are using AI in creative ways. and to, you know, try to do something just a little bit creative every day myself.\n\nCHRISTINA WARREN: I love that. think that's a great resolution and I might take some cues from you and try to do something similar. I really like that. Okay, that is all of our time that we've got for today.
