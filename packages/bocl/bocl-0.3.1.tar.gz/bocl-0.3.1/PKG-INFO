# BESSER Object Constraint Language Interpreter

**B-OCL** is a tool designed to parse and evaluate the OCL constraints designed on **BESSER** models.
It is a python based implementation, that utilises parser and listener generated with the ANTLR4 grammer.

**BESSER** is a low-modeling low-code open-source platform built on top 
of our Python-based personal interpretation of a "Universal Modeling Language"

## Basic Installation
We have tested B-OCL with python 3.9+. We recommend creating a virtual environment using `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_, or
`conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_).

Dependencies
************
B-OCL depends on BESSER for parsing the OCL constraints and providing a concrete syntax tree (CST) to evaluate. The latest stable version of BESSER is available in the Python Package Index (PyPi) and can be installed using


    $ pip install besser


# B-OCL Installation


Stable version of B-OCL interpreter can be installed via

    $ pip install bocl
