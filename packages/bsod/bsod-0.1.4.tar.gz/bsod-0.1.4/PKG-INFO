### Introduction

Welcome to the `bsod` (Blue Screen of Death) Python Package â€“ a silly lighthearted tool that pops up a bsod screen, that's it.

### Installation

To install this package, simply use pip:

```bash
pip install bsod
```

### Usage

Unleash the whimsy of the Blue Screen of Death with a single command:

```bash
bsod
```

Now, you can also add a timer, here's an example:
```
bsod -t 20
```
Note: the time is supposed to be passed in seconds.

Now sit back and watch until the BSOD screen pops up.
