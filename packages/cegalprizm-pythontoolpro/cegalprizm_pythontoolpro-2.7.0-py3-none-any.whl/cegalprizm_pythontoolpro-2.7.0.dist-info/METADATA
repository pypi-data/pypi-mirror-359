# Introduction

A Python library for interfacing with Petrel.

# Usage

Python Tool Pro requires a connection to be established from the preferred client-side Python IDE to the Python Tool Pro server in Petrel. Petrel domain objects are accessed from the external Python IDE and the scripts are executed outside of Petrel. The results of the Python scripts are then streamed back to Petrel.

# Basic Example - Open connection

```python
from cegalprizm.pythontool import PetrelConnection
petrel = PetrelConnection()
project_name = petrel.get_current_project_name()
print(f'Name of currently active Petrel project is "{project_name}"')
petrel.close()
```
