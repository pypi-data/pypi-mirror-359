Outputs
=======

The tool creates several files and folders in the specified output directory.
It generates separate directory for each fold (e.g. 2.image_embedding_fold1, 2.image_embedding_fold2).
Below is the list and description of each output generated by the tool.

- ``image_emd.tsv``:
    A tab-separated file containing the generated embeddings for each image. Each row corresponds to an image and the subsequent columns contain the embedding vector.

- ``labels_prob.tsv``:
    This tab-separated file contains probability scores for each of the 28 possible protein labels (e.g., Nucleoplasm, N. membrane, etc.) for each image.

- ``model.pth``:
    The pre-trained Densenet model used for image embedding.

- ``blue_resize``:
    This directory contains images that are processed in the blue channel.

- ``green_resize``:
    This directory contains images that are processed in the green channel.

- ``red_resize``:
    This directory contains images that are processed in the red channel.

- ``yellow_resize``:
    This directory contains images that are processed in the yellow channel.

Logs and Metadata
-----------------

- ``output.log``:
    A log file detailing the activities and potential issues encountered during the image embedding process.

- ``error.log``:
    If any errors occur during the execution of the script, they will be recorded in this log file.

- ``ro-crate-metadata.json``:
    Metadata in RO-Crate_ format, a community effort to establish a lightweight approach to packaging research data with their metadata.

    The main object contains identifier (@id), type (@type), name, descriptions, keywords and isPartOf, that describes the hierarchical relationship (organization and project).

    Graph: The @graph key contains an array of objects that detail other entities related to the main dataset.
    a. Metadata, Datasets, Software
    b. Output Files: details of output files generated by the tool.
    c. Images: details about specific image files, including keywords, descriptions, formats, and content URLs.
