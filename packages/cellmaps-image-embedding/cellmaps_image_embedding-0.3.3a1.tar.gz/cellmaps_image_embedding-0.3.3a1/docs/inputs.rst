=======

The tool requires a path to a ro-crate (directory) passed in ``--inputdir`` parameter as its input.
The directory should contain following files:

- ``blue``, ``red``, ``green``, ``yellow``:
    Directories containing downloaded images in different color spectrum.

- ``1_image_gene_node_attributes.tsv``:
    A TSV file containing attributes for image genes generated during the first fold of execution. ``2_image_gene_node_attributes.tsv`` corresponds
    to the second fold of execution etc.

    It is necessary that the file contains ``name`` and ``filename`` columns as they are directly referenced in the code,
    but it will usually also have other columns described below:

    * name - contains the gene symbol. In some cases, it can contain an ensembl ID or another query, that mygene was queried with.
    * represents - a comma-separated list of Ensembl gene IDs that the gene symbol represents.
    * ambiguous - a comma-separated list of gene symbols/ queries that are considered ambiguous for the given antibody.
    * antibody - the ID of the antibody used in the experiment.
    * filename - the filename where the image associated with the gene and antibody can be found.
    * imageurl - the url of the image if found

- ``ro-crate-metadata.json``:
    Metadata in RO-Crate_ format, a community effort to establish a lightweight approach to packaging research data with their metadata.

    The main object contains identifier (@id), type (@type), name, descriptions, keywords and isPartOf, that describes the hierarchical relationship (organization and project).

    Graph: The @graph key contains an array of objects that detail other entities related to the main dataset.
    a. Metadata, Datasets, Software
    b. Output Files: details of output files generated by the tool.
    c. Images: details about specific image files, including keywords, descriptions, formats, and content URLs.
