`cifkit` is designed to provide a set of fully-tested utility functions and
variables for handling large datasets, on the order of tens of thousands, of
`.cif` files.

## Features:

`cifkit` provides higher-level functions in just a few lines of code.

- **Coordination geometry** - `cifkit` provides functions for visualing
  coordination geometry from each site and extracts physics-based features like
  volume and packing efficiency in each polyhedron.
- **Atomic mixing** - `cifkit` extracts atomic mixing information at the bond
  pair level—tasks that would otherwise require extensive manual effort using
  GUI-based tools like VESTA, Diamond, and CrystalMaker.
- **Filter** - `cifkit` offers features for preprocessing. It systematically
  addresses common issues in CIF files from databases, such as incorrect loop
  values and missing fractional coordinates, by standardizing and filtering out
  ill-formatted files. It also preprocesses atomic site labels, transforming
  labels such as 'M1' to 'Fe1' in files with atomic mixing.
- **Sort** - `cifkit` allows you to copy, move, and sort `.cif` files based on
  attributes such as coordination numbers, space groups, unit cells, shortest
  distances, elements, and more.

### Example usage 1 - coordination geometry

The example below uses `cifkit` to visualize the polyhedron generated from each
atomic site based on the coordination number geometry.

```python
from cifkit import Cif

cif = Cif("your_cif_file_path")
site_labels = cif.site_labels

# Loop through each site label
for label in site_labels:
    # Dipslay each polyhedron, .png saved for each label
    cif.plot_polyhedron(label, is_displayed=True)
```

### Example Usage 2 - sort

The following example generates a distribution of structure.

```python
from cifkit import CifEnsemble

ensemble = CifEnsemble("your_folder_path_containing_cif_files")
ensemble.generate_structure_histogram()
```

![structure distribution](docs/source/img/histogram-structure.png)

Basde on your visual histogram above, you can copy and move .cif files based on
specific attributes:

```python
# Return file paths matching structures either Co1.75Ge or CoIn2
ensemble.filter_by_structures(["Co1.75Ge", "CoIn2"])

# Return file path matching CeAl2Ga2
ensemble.filter_by_structures("CeAl2Ga2")
```

## Quotes

Here is a quote illustrating how `cifkit` addresses one of the challenges
mentioned above.

> "I am building an X-Ray diffraction analysis (XRD) pattern visualization
> script for my lab using `pymatgen`. I feel like `cifkit` integrated really
> well into my existing stable of libraries, while surpassing some alternatives
> in preprocessing and parsing. For example, it was often unclear at what stage
> an error occurred—whether during pre-processing with `CifParser`, or XRD plot
> generation with `diffraction.core` in `pymatgen`. The pre-processing logic in
> `cifkit` was communicated clearly, both in documentation and in actual
> outputs, allowing me to catch errors in my data before it was used in my
> visualizations. I now use `cifkit` by default for processing CIFs before they
> pass through the rest of my pipeline." - Alex Vtorov `
