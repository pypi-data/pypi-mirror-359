## ü§ù Code of Conduct

By participating in this CloudThat project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct:

- **Be Respectful**: Treat all community members with respect and kindness
- **Be Constructive**: Provide helpful feedback and suggestions
- **Be Inclusive**: Welcome newcomers and help them get started
- **Be Professional**: Maintain a professional tone in all communications
- **Be Patient**: Remember that everyone has different experience levels

## üöÄ Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**

- **Python**: 3.10 or higher
- **Git**: Latest version
- **GitLab Account**: For accessing CloudThat's GitLab repository
- **Jenkins Instance**: For testing (optional but recommended)
- **IDE**: VS Code, PyCharm, or similar with Python support

### **Development Setup**

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   # Fork the repository on GitLab first, then:
   git clone https://gitlab.cloudthat.com/your-username/jenkins_mcp.git
   cd jenkins_mcp
   
   # Add upstream remote
   git remote add upstream https://gitlab.cloudthat.com/cloudthat-oss/jenkins_mcp.git
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Development Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install the package in development mode with all dependencies
   pip install -e ".[dev,test]"
   
   # Install pre-commit hooks
   pre-commit install
   ```

4. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   # Run tests to ensure everything is working
   pytest
   
   # Check code style
   ruff check .
   
   # Run type checking
   mypy jenkins_mcp_server/
   ```

5. **Set Up Test Environment** (Optional)
   ```bash
   # Create .env file for testing
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env with your Jenkins test instance details
   JENKINS_URL=http://your-test-jenkins:8080
   JENKINS_USERNAME=test-user
   JENKINS_TOKEN=your-test-token
   ```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### **Branch Naming Conventions**

Use descriptive branch names following this pattern:

```
<type>/<short-description>

Types:
- feature/    # New features
- fix/        # Bug fixes
- docs/       # Documentation updates
- refactor/   # Code refactoring
- test/       # Test improvements
- chore/      # Maintenance tasks
```

**Examples:**
- `feature/add-pipeline-validation`
- `fix/build-trigger-timeout`
- `docs/update-installation-guide`
- `refactor/improve-error-handling`

### **Commit Message Format**

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(handlers): add pipeline validation support

Add server-side Jenkinsfile validation before pipeline creation
to catch syntax errors early and provide better user feedback.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(build): resolve parameterized build triggering issue

The build_job method was not properly handling parameter
serialization for complex parameter types.

Fixes #456
```

## üìè Code Standards

### **Python Code Style**

We use **Ruff** for code formatting and linting:

```bash
# Format code
ruff format .

# Check for linting issues
ruff check .

# Fix auto-fixable issues
ruff check --fix .
```

### **Code Quality Requirements**

1. **Type Hints**: All functions must have proper type hints
   ```python
   def create_job(self, job_name: str, job_type: str) -> JobResult:
       """Create a new Jenkins job."""
       pass
   ```

2. **Docstrings**: All public functions must have docstrings
   ```python
   def trigger_build(self, job_name: str, parameters: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> BuildResult:
       """Trigger a Jenkins build.
       
       Args:
           job_name: Name of the job to trigger
           parameters: Optional build parameters
           
       Returns:
           BuildResult: Result of the build trigger operation
           
       Raises:
           JenkinsError: If the build fails to trigger
       """
       pass
   ```

3. **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling with specific error types
   ```python
   try:
       result = await self.jenkins_client.build_job(job_name)
   except jenkins.JenkinsException as e:
       raise JenkinsConnectionError(f"Failed to trigger build: {e}")
   ```

4. **Logging**: Use structured logging with appropriate levels
   ```python
   logger.info(f"Triggering build for job: {job_name}")
   logger.debug(f"Build parameters: {parameters}")
   ```

### **Import Organization**

Organize imports in this order:
1. Standard library imports
2. Third-party imports
3. Local application imports

```python
# Standard library
import asyncio
from typing import Dict, List, Optional

# Third-party
import httpx
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Local
from jenkins_mcp_server.exceptions import JenkinsError
from jenkins_mcp_server.models import BuildResult
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### **Test Structure**

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test end-to-end functionality
- **Mock Tests**: Use mocks for external dependencies

### **Writing Tests**

1. **Test File Naming**: `test_<module_name>.py`
2. **Test Function Naming**: `test_<functionality>_<scenario>`
3. **Test Organization**: Group related tests in classes

```python
class TestBuildHandler:
    """Test cases for BuildHandler."""
    
    async def test_trigger_build_success(self):
        """Test successful build triggering."""
        # Arrange
        handler = BuildHandler()
        
        # Act
        result = await handler.trigger_build("test-job")
        
        # Assert
        assert result.triggered is True
        assert result.queue_item_id is not None
    
    async def test_trigger_build_with_invalid_job_name(self):
        """Test build triggering with invalid job name."""
        handler = BuildHandler()
        
        with pytest.raises(ValidationError):
            await handler.trigger_build("")
```

### **Running Tests**

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=jenkins_mcp_server --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_build_handler.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run tests in parallel
pytest -n auto
```

### **Test Coverage Requirements**

- **Minimum Coverage**: 85%
- **New Code Coverage**: 90%
- **Critical Paths**: 100% (authentication, build triggering, etc.)

## üìö Documentation
