[CDF-24991] üåç Asset profiler try 2 (#1662)

# Description

Stacked on <del>#1653 #1655 #1660 #1664 </del>

The goal of this profiler is to get an overview over the linage of an
Asset Hierarchy.
It works by selecting an hierarchy, the profiler will then for each
resource (assets, events, timeseries, files, sequences) do the following
* Count the resources
* Find the used data sets.
* Count resources in each dataset
* Find the transformations writing to the datasets.
* Find the RAW tables used as the source.
* Find the size of the raw tables.
