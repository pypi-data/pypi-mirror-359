# ComfyFusion Engine - 智能化 ComfyUI 工作流执行引擎

🚀 基于 FastMCP 2.0+ 的 ComfyUI 智能代理服务，采用创新的三工具协作架构和流式协议设计。

## 🌟 核心特性

### 三工具协作架构
- **工具1 (`list_workflows`)**：工作流枚举器，提供可用工作流清单
- **工具2 (`analyze_and_execute`)**：智能分析器，分析用户需求并生成工作流补丁
- **工具3 (`execute_workflow`)**：纯执行引擎，执行三层融合和ComfyUI调用

### LLM引导的工具链协作
- 工具2不直接调用工具3，而是通过返回引导信息让Client LLM自动调用工具3
- 实现真正的MCP协议合规的工具链协作
- 符合FastMCP最佳实践

### 流式协议支持
- 所有工具函数支持 `AsyncGenerator` 流式返回
- 提供实时执行反馈和进度跟踪
- 支持流式错误处理和状态更新

### 三层融合架构
```
用户输入层 (Dynamic Patch)   [最高优先级]
    ⬇️ 覆盖合并
静态配置层 (Template)        [中间优先级] 
    ⬇️ 覆盖合并
基础工作流层 (Workflow)       [基础蓝图]
```

## 🛠️ 技术栈

- **FastMCP** >= 2.0.0 - MCP服务器框架
- **Pydantic** >= 2.0.0 - 数据验证
- **HTTPX** >= 0.24.0 - 异步HTTP客户端
- **aiofiles** >= 23.0.0 - 异步文件操作
- **deepmerge** >= 1.1.0 - 深度合并
- **watchdog** >= 3.0.0 - 文件系统监控

## 📦 安装

### 环境要求
- Python >= 3.9
- ComfyUI 正在运行（默认 http://127.0.0.1:8188）

### 安装步骤

1. **克隆项目**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mcp-comfyui-anything
```

2. **安装依赖**
```bash
pip install -e .
```

3. **配置设置**
```bash
# 可选：修改配置文件
cp config/settings.json config/settings.local.json
```

## 🚀 快速开始

### 1. 启动服务器
```bash
python run_server.py
```

### 2. 添加工作流

在 `workflows/` 目录中添加工作流文件对：

**基础工作流** (`workflows/my_workflow.json`):
```json
{
  "3": {
    "inputs": {
      "seed": 12345,
      "steps": 20,
      "cfg": 8.0,
      "model": ["4", 0],
      "positive": ["6", 0],
      "negative": ["7", 0],
      "latent_image": ["5", 0]
    },
    "class_type": "KSampler"
  }
  // ... 更多节点
}
```

**模板文件** (`workflows/my_workflow_tp.json`):
```json
{
  "_meta": {
    "description": "我的工作流",
    "category": "image_generation",
    "tags": ["text2image"],
    "version": "1.0"
  },
  "6": {
    "inputs": {
      "text": "{prompt}"
    }
  },
  "5": {
    "inputs": {
      "width": "{width}",
      "height": "{height}"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. 使用工具

#### 查看可用工作流
```python
result = await client.call_tool("list_workflows")
```

#### 智能分析执行
```python
result = await client.call_tool("analyze_and_execute", {
    "user_request": "生成一只可爱的橘猫，动漫风格",
    "workflow_name": "text2image_v1"
})
```

#### 执行工作流
```python
result = await client.call_tool("execute_workflow", {
    "workflow_name": "text2image_v1", 
    "workflow_patch": {
        "prompt": "a cute orange cat, anime style",
        "width": 1024,
        "height": 1024
    }
})
```

## ⚙️ 配置

### 基础配置 (`config/settings.json`)
```json
{
  "comfyui": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 8188,
    "timeout": 300
  },
  "mcp": {
    "server_name": "comfyfusion-engine",
    "description": "ComfyUI 智能工作流执行引擎",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "protocol": "streaming",
    "enable_streams": true
  },
  "paths": {
    "workflows": "./workflows"
  },
  "logging": {
    "level": "INFO"
  }
}
```

## 🔧 工作流管理

### 文件命名规范
- 基础工作流：`{工作流名称}.json`
- 模板文件：`{工作流名称}_tp.json`

### 模板设计最佳实践

1. **使用 `_meta` 字段**描述工作流信息
2. **参数化占位符**使用 `{参数名}` 格式
3. **合理分组**相关参数到同一节点
4. **提供默认值**确保基础工作流可独立运行

### 示例模板结构
```json
{
  "_meta": {
    "description": "工作流描述",
    "category": "分类",
    "tags": ["标签1", "标签2"],
    "version": "1.0",
    "author": "作者",
    "created_at": "2024-01-01",
    "updated_at": "2024-01-01"
  },
  "节点ID": {
    "inputs": {
      "参数名": "{占位符}"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🌊 流式特性

### 实时进度反馈
```python
async for update in client.call_tool_stream("execute_workflow", args):
    print(f"进度: {update.get('progress', 0)}%")
    print(f"状态: {update.get('status', 'processing')}")
```

### 错误流式处理
- 异常和错误信息通过流式协议实时反馈
- 支持优雅降级和自动重试
- 详细的错误追踪和调试信息

## 🔄 工具协作流程

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[用户请求] --> B[工具2: 智能分析]
    B --> C[生成工作流补丁]
    C --> D[返回引导信息]
    D --> E[Client LLM 理解]
    E --> F[自动调用工具3]
    F --> G[执行三层融合]
    G --> H[调用ComfyUI API]
    H --> I[返回结果URL]
```

## 🛡️ 错误处理

### 监控与日志
- **流式监控**：实时状态和性能指标
- **审计日志**：完整的操作记录
- **错误追踪**：详细的异常信息

### 资源管理
- **并发控制**：合理的任务队列管理
- **资源限制**：CPU、内存和执行时间限制
- **自动清理**：临时文件和缓存管理

      in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
      direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
      character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
      to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
      commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
      the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
      acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
      and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
      obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
      responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
      agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
      liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
