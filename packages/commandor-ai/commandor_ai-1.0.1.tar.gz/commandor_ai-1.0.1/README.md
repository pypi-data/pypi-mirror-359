🚀 COMMANDOR - Your AI-Powered Terminal Assistant 🚀

Commandor $ /ai list all python files
🤖 AI → find . -name "*.py" -type f

Commandor $ /ai create a directory called projects
🤖 AI → mkdir projects

Commandor $ /ai show disk usage
🤖 AI → df -h

Commandor $ /ai find large files over 100MB
🤖 AI → find . -type f -size +100M -exec ls -lh {} \;
```

### ✨ NEW: Direct AI Questions

Ask the AI assistant anything directly without generating commands:

```bash
Commandor $ /ask What is the difference between Python and JavaScript?
🤔 Thinking...

🤖 AI Response:
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Python and JavaScript are both popular programming languages but serve different purposes:

**Python:**
- General-purpose language, great for data science, AI, web backends
- Interpreted, readable syntax
- Strong in scientific computing and automation
- Used for desktop applications, web servers, data analysis

**JavaScript:**
- Originally for web browsers, now also server-side (Node.js)
- Essential for web development and interactive websites
- Event-driven and asynchronous
- Used for frontend, backend, and mobile apps

Both are beginner-friendly but excel in different domains!
──────────────────────────────────────────────────

Commandor $ /ask How do I optimize my Python code for better performance?
🤔 Thinking...

🤖 AI Response:
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Here are key strategies for Python optimization:

1. **Use built-in functions** - They're implemented in C and much faster
2. **List comprehensions** - Faster than traditional loops
3. **Avoid global variables** - Local variables are accessed faster
4. **Use appropriate data structures** - Sets for membership testing, deques for queues
5. **Profile your code** - Use cProfile to find bottlenecks
6. **NumPy for numerical operations** - Vectorized operations are much faster
7. **Cache expensive function calls** - Use @lru_cache decorator
8. **Use generators** - For memory-efficient iteration

Focus on the biggest bottlenecks first for maximum impact!

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found

If you get "commandor: command not found":

1. **Check if the package is installed:**
   ```bash
   pip show commandor
   ```

2. **Check your PATH:**
   ```bash
   echo $PATH
   ```

3. **Find where pip installs scripts:**
   ```bash
   python -m site --user-base
   ```

4. **Add to PATH if needed (add to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`):**
   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:$(python -m site --user-base)/bin"
   ```

### API Key Issues

- Make sure your `.env` file contains: `GEMINI=your_actual_api_key`
- Verify the API key is valid at [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- Check that the `.env` file is in your home directory or current working directory

### Windows Users

For better experience on Windows, install pyreadline3:
```bash
pip install pyreadline3
```
