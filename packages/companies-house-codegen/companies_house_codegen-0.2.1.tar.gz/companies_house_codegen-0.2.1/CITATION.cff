  Companies House is an executive agency of the Department
  for Business and Trade, a department of the British
  Government. This official UK agency is responsible for
  incorperating and dissolving companies, and maintaining a
  register of information of limited companies (and some
  other companies) under the Companies Act and related
  legislation to be made available for public access.


  Companies House hosts a JSON REST API called the Companies
  House API, which makes it possible for software developers
  to create application to retrieve information from
  Companies House's database (e.g. searching and retrieving
  public company data), as well as, interact with Companies
  House's database (e.g. manipulating company information,
  givem you have authority to do so). The full documentation
  for Companies House API can be found at the Companies
  House Developer Hub.


  Unfortunately, the Companies House API does not come with
  an official SDK. Fortunately, the API is documented fully
  defined in OpenAPI (specifically Swagger 2.0)
  specifications - an open source standard for defining
  APIs. Since OpenAPI is industry standard there are many
  tools that exist that produce high quality SDKs from
  OpenAPI definitions. For example, Cloudflare, OpenAI,
  Anthropic and many define their SDKs in OpenAPI3 and
  generate them using Stainless. Unfortunately, these
  definitions are distributed amongst many files (i.e. the
  API is broken down into several smaller API products, with
  the Companies House Public Data API product by itself
  being distributed over 22 files!). Moreover, these
  definitions contain various errors that make them
  unusable.


  This small, configurable and simple tool fetches the
  OpenAPI for Companies House API, formats them to fix
  errors found in them.
