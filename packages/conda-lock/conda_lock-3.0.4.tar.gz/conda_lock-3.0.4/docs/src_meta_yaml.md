# meta.yaml

[Conda build][condabuild] defines package recipes using the [meta.yaml][metayaml] format.

Conda-lock will attempt to make an educated guess at the desired environment spec in a meta.yaml.

This is **not** guaranteed to work for complex recipes with many selectors and outputs or complex use of jinja templates.

For multi-output recipes, conda-lock will fuse all the dependencies together.  If that doesn't work for your case fall back to specifying the specification as an [environment.yml](src_environment_yml.md)

```{.yaml title="meta.yaml"}

{% set version = "1.0.5" %}

package:
  name: foo
  version: {{ version }}

build:
  number: 0
  script:
    - export PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1  # [ppc64le]
    - {{ PYTHON }} -m pip install --no-deps --ignore-installed .
  skip: True  # [py2k]

requirements:
  build:
    - {{ compiler('c') }}
    - {{ compiler('cxx') }}
  host:
    - python
    - pip
    - cython >=0.28.2
    - numpy
  run:
    - python
    - {{ pin_compatible('numpy') }}
    - python-dateutil >=2.6.1
    - pytz >=2017.2
    - zlib     # [unix]

test:
  requires:
    - pytest
```

## Categories

- `build` requirements are ignored
- `host` and `run` dependencies are treated as **main**
- `test.requires` dependencies are treated as **dev**

By default conda-lock will include dev dependencies in the specification of the lock (if the files that the lock
is being built from support them).  This can be disabled easily

```sh
conda-lock --no-dev-dependencies --file meta.yaml
```

## Preprocessing Selectors

You may use preprocessing selectors, but there are currently some limitations to be aware of:
- Only OS-specific selectors are currently supported. See Conda's [documentation][selectors] for the list of supported selectors. Selectors related to Python or Numpy versions are not supported
- conda-lock supports an additional unique selector `osx64`. It is true if the platform is macOS and the Python architecture is 64-bit and uses x86.
- `not`, `and`, and `or` clauses inside of selectors are not supported
- Comparison operators (`==`, `>`, `<`, etc) are not supported


## Extensions

### Channel specification

Since a meta.yaml doesn't contain channel information we make use of the following `extra` key to specify channels

```yaml
extra:
  channels:
    - conda-forge
    - defaults
```
