# Connect Python

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/connect-python/badge/?version=latest)](https://connect-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

A Python implementation of the Connect RPC framework.

This provides an asynchronous client runtime, as well as a client code
generator, to let Python programs communicate with Connect servers.

## Features

 - Straightforward, simple client backed by urllib3
 - *and also* async, `aiohttp`-powered client for efficient use in
   real production servers.
 - Fully type-annotated, including the generated code, and verified
   with mypy.
 - Verified implementation using the official
   [conformance](https://github.com/connectprc/conformance) test
   suite.

## Usage

With a protobuf definition in hand, you can generate a client. This is
easiest using buf, but you can also use protoc if you're feeling
masochistic.

Install the compiler (eg `pip install connect-python[compiler]`), and
it can be referenced as `protoc-gen-connect_python`.

A reasonable `buf.gen.yaml`:
```yaml
version: v2
plugins:
  - remote: buf.build/protocolbuffers/python
    out: .
  - remote: buf.build/protocolbuffers/pyi
    out: .
  - local: .venv/bin/protoc-gen-connect_python
    out: .
```

If you have a proto definition like this:

```proto
service ElizaService {
  rpc Say(SayRequest) returns (SayResponse) {}
  rpc Converse(stream ConverseRequest) returns (stream ConverseResponse) {}
  rpc Introduce(IntroduceRequest) returns (stream IntroduceResponse) {}
  rpc Pontificate(stream PontificateRequest) returns (PontificateResponse) {}
}
```

Then the generated client will have methods like this (optional arguments have been elided for clarity):
```python
class ElizaServiceClient:
    def __init__(self, base_url: str, http_client: urllib3.PoolManager):
        ...

    # Unary (no streams)
    def say(self, req: eliza_pb2.SayRequest) -> eliza_pb2.SayResponse:
        ...

    # Bidirectional (both sides stream)
    def converse(self, req: Iterator[eliza_pb2.ConverseRequest]) -> Iterator[eliza_pb2.SayResponse]:
        ...

    # Server streaming (client sends one message, server sends a stream)
    def introduce(self, req: eliza_pb2.IntroduceRequest) -> Iterator[eliza_pb2.IntroduceResponse]:
        ...

    # Client streaming (client sends a stream, server sends one message back)
    def pontificate(self, req: Iterator[eliza_pb2.PontificateRequest]) -> eliza_pb2.PontificateResponse]:
        ...
```

which you can use like this:

```python
eliza_client = ElizaServiceClient("https://demo.connectrpc.com", urllib3.PoolManager())

# Unary responses:
response = eliza_client.say(eliza_pb2.SayRequest(sentence="Hello, Eliza!"))
print(f"  Eliza says: {response.sentence}")

# Streaming responses: use 'for' to iterate over messages in the stream
req = eliza_pb2.IntroduceRequest(name="Henry")
for response in eliza_client.introduce(req):
	print(f"   Eliza: {response.sentence}")

# Streaming requests: send an iterator, get a single message
requests = [
	eliza_pb2.PontificateRequest(sentence="I have many things on my mind."),
	eliza_pb2.PontificateRequest(sentence="But I will save them for later."),
]
response = await eliza_client.pontificate(requests)
print("    Eliza responds: {response.sentence}")

# Bidirectional RPCs: send an iterator, get an iterator.
requests = [
	eliza_pb2.ConverseRequest(sentence="I have been having trouble communicating."),
	eliza_pb2.ConverseRequest(sentence="But structured RPCs are pretty great!"),
	eliza_pb2.ConverseRequest(sentence="What do you think?")
]
for response in eliza_client.converse(requests):
	print("    Eliza: {response.sentence}")
```

### Servers

This library also supports running Connect servers. Currently, only
synchronous servers running as WSGI applications are supported, but
ASGI-based servers are planned.

The generated code includes a function that you can use to mount an
object which implements your service as a WSGI application:

```python
def wsgi_eliza_service(implementation: ElizaServiceProtocol) -> WSGIApplication:
    ...
```

That `ElizaServiceProtocol` is also defined in the generated code, and
it describes the method set that your object needs to implement:

```python
@typing.runtime_checkable
class ElizaServiceProtocol(typing.Protocol):
    def say(self, req: ClientRequest[eliza_pb2.SayRequest]) -> ServerResponse[eliza_pb2.SayResponse]:
        ...
    def converse(self, req: ClientStream[eliza_pb2.ConverseRequest]) -> ServerStream[eliza_pb2.ConverseResponse]:
        ...
    def introduce(self, req: ClientRequest[eliza_pb2.IntroduceRequest]) -> ServerStream[eliza_pb2.IntroduceResponse]:
        ...
```

That is, each RPC method becomes a method you need to implement. The
input and output types have little wrappers:

 - `ClientRequest` bundles the protobuf message (as
   `ClientRequest.msg`) with request metadata (headers and trailers)
   as well as any client-requested timeout.
 - `ClientStream` provides headers and a timeout, and is an iterator -
   you can do `for msg in stream` with a ClientStream. 
 - `ServerResponse` gives a way to return header and trailer metadata
   alongside the response message (or alongside a `ConnectError`
   error).
 - `ServerStream` gives a way to return header and trailer metadata
   alongside an iterator of response messages. The iterator is also
   allowed to yield a `ConnectError` at any point to interrupt
   streaming and abort with the given error.
   
These docs are immature, and more is to come on them. I'd like to get
a Read the Docs site up, this README is getting unwieldy.

### Advanced usage

#### Sending extra headers

All RPC methods take an `extra_headers: HeaderInput`
argument. `HeaderInput` is defined in
[connectrpc.headers](./src/connectrpc/headers.py), and is a type
alias; you can use a `dict[str, str]`.

So if you want to send a header like `X-Favorite-RPC: Connect` in your
`say` request, you'd do this:

```python
eliza_client.say(req, extra_headers={"X-Favorite-RPC": "Connect"})
```

#### Per-request timeouts

All RPC methods take a `timeout_seconds: float` argument. When passed,
the timeout will be used in two ways:

 1. It will be set in the `Connect-Timeout-Ms` header, so the server
    will be informed of the deadline you have set.
 2. `aiohttp` will be informed, and will close the request if the
    timeout expires.

So for example:
```python
eliza_client.say(req, timeout_seconds=2.5)
```

#### Async Client

The code generator also produces an async client. This thing is
substantially harder to use, but will allow for concurrent operations,
which should be much more efficient under real load: while you wait
for one call to return, your program will do other useful things, then
come back to the RPC when data is available.

```python
class AsyncElizaServiceClient:
    def __init__(self, base_url: str, http_client: aiohttp.ClientSession):
        ...

    # Unary (no streams)
    async def say(self, req: eliza_pb2.SayRequest) -> eliza_pb2.SayResponse:
        ...

    # Bidirectional (both sides stream)
    def converse(self, req: StreamInput[eliza_pb2.ConverseRequest]) -> AsyncIterator[eliza_pb2.SayResponse]:
        ...

    # Server streaming (client sends one message, server sends a stream)
    def introduce(self, req: eliza_pb2.IntroduceRequest) -> AsyncIterator[eliza_pb2.IntroduceResponse]:
        ...

    # Client streaming (client sends a stream, server sends one message back)
    def pontificate(self, req: StreamInput[eliza_pb2.PontificateRequest]) -> eliza_pb2.PontificateResponse]:
        ...
```

which you can use like this:

```python
async def main():
    with aiohttp.ClientSession() as http_client:
        eliza_client = AsyncElizaServiceClient("https://demo.connectrpc.com")

        # Unary responses: await and get the response message back
        response = await eliza_client.say(eliza_pb2.SayRequest(sentence="Hello, Eliza!"))
        print(f"  Eliza says: {response.sentence}")

        # Streaming responses: use async for to iterate over messages in the stream
        req = eliza_pb2.IntroduceRequest(name="Henry")
        async for response in eliza_client.introduce(req):
            print(f"   Eliza: {response.sentence}")

        # Streaming requests: send an iterator, get a single message
        requests = [
            eliza_pb2.PontificateRequest(sentence="I have many things on my mind."),
            eliza_pb2.PontificateRequest(sentence="But I will save them for later."),
        ]
        response = await eliza_client.pontificate(requests)
        print("    Eliza responds: {response.sentence}")

        # Bidirectional RPCs: send an iterator, get an iterator
        requests = [
            eliza_pb2.ConverseRequest(sentence="I have been having trouble communicating."),
            eliza_pb2.ConverseRequest(sentence="But structured RPCs are pretty great!"),
            eliza_pb2.ConverseRequest(sentence="What do you think?")
        ]
        async for response in eliza_client.converse(requests):
            print("    Eliza: {response.sentence}")

```



#### Low-level Call APIs

Connect supports response headers and trailers, and has a rich error
system. To get access to these, use the low-level `call` APIs.

Each generated RPC method has an associated `call_` method. For
example, the `say` RPC will have `eliza_client.call_say`, and the
`converse` RPC will have `eliza_client.call_converse`, and so on.

These `call` methods return types which represents the nitty-gritty
details, and can be used to access response header and trailer
metadata

 - for unary requests and client-streaming requests, the response `T`
   is wrapped in a `connectrpc.unary.UnaryOutput[T]`.
 - for server-streaming and bidirectional requests, you get
   `connectrpc.streams.StreamOutput[T]` (or `AsyncStreamOutput[T]`, if
   you're using the async client).

##### Accessing messages

For `UnaryOutput`, the message is easy to get - it's under a `message()` accessor:

```python
output = eliza_client.call_say(req)
response = output.message()
print(response.sentence)
```

`StreamOutput`s require a little more work. In order to avoid leaking
HTTP connection resources, AsyncStreamOutputs need to be cleaned up after
use with `output.close()`. You can handle that by using them as a
context manager:

```python
output = eliza_client.call_introduce(req)
with output as stream:
    ...  # All IO will happen inside this block
```

The stream from this context manager is an iterator - you can iterate
over the messages this way:

```python
messages = []
output = eliza_client.call_introduce(req)
with output as stream:
    for response in stream:
        # each element in stream is the protobuf message type,
        # already deserialized
        messages.append(response.sentence)

if output.error() is not None:
    raise output.error()
```

The async client has exactly analagous capabilities:

```python
messages = []
output = async_eliza_client.call_introduce(req)
async with output as stream:
    async for response in stream:
        # each element in stream is the protobuf message type,
        # already deserialized
        messages.append(response.sentence)

if output.error() is not None:
    raise output.error()
```

##### Response metadata

`UnaryOutput` and `StreamOutput` provide access to metadata in the same way:

```python
headers = output.response_headers()
trailers = output.response_trailers()
```

These are
[`CIMultiDict[str]`](https://multidict.aio-libs.org/en/stable/multidict/#multidict.CIMultiDict)
objects - that is, case-insensitive multiple-valued
dictionaries. Basically, you can think of them as `dict[str,
list[str]]` with case-insensitive keys and a few conveniences.

Note that the `response_trailers` of a `StreamOutput` are only
accessible after the stream has been fully consumed. Iterate over all
responses in the stream before trying to access the trailers, or else
you'll get an exception.

##### Errors

`UnaryOutput` and `StreamOutput` both give you errors through the
`error()` accessor function, which returns a
`connectrpc.errors.ConnectError` exception, which includes a code,
message, and optionally extra details.

Note that the error in a `StreamOutput` might not be available until
you've consumed all messages in the stream. For `UnaryOutput`, it is
available right away.

The `call` APIs do not generally raise errors. It's up to you to
`raise output.error()` if you so desire.

## Current State

### Client Supported Features

The client supports the Connect Protocol over HTTP 1.1, verified with
the official conformance test suite.

Unary, client streaming, and server streaming RPCs are fully
supported.

Only half-duplex bidirectional streaming is supported. This means the
client sends _all_ of its stream messages before yielding any of the
server's responses. This is because we're on HTTP 1.1, and is the case
for both synchronous and asynchronous clients.

The client correctly handles response headers, trailers, and all error
codes.

### Server supported features

The server supports the Connect Protocol over HTTP 1.1, verified with
the official conformance test suite.

Unary, client streaming, and server streaming RPCs are fully
supported.

Only half-duplex bidirectional streaming is supported. This means the
client sends _all_ of its stream messages before yielding any of the
server's responses. This is because we're on HTTP 1.1, and is the case
for both synchronous and asynchronous clients.

The server correctly handles compression and client-set timeouts. It
provides client headers and allows setting response headers and
trailers.

### Not yet supported (but definitely planned)

- Client Compression
- Client Conformance tests of TLS
- Async server built on ASGI

### Not yet supported (and maybe never will be?)

- http/2 client transport
- gRPC server compatibility

## Installation

For basic client functionality:
```bash
pip install connect-python
```

For code generation (protoc plugin):
```bash
pip install connect-python[compiler]
```

### Development

We use `ruff` for linting and formatting, and `mypy` for type checking.

We rely on the conformance test suit (in
[./tests/conformance](./tests/conformance)) to verify behavior.

Set up development dependencies:
```sh
uv sync --extra dev --extra compiler
```

Install the package in editable mode to produce a local `protoc-gen-connect_python` plugin for use with `protoc`:
```sh
uv pip install -e .[compiler]
```

Then, use `uv run just` to do development checks:
```
Available recipes:
    all                    # Run all checks (format, check, mypy, test, integration-test)
    check                  # Check code with ruff linter
    conformance-test *ARGS # Run conformance tests (requires connectconformance binary). Usage: just conformance-test [ARGS...]
    fix                    # Fix auto-fixable ruff linter issues
    format                 # Format code with ruff
    integration-test       # Run integration test against demo.connectrpc.com
    mypy                   # Run mypy type checking
    mypy-package
    mypy-tests
    protoc-gen *ARGS       # Run protoc with connect_python plugin (development mode). usage: just protoc-gen [PROTOC_ARGS...]
    test                   # Run tests
```

For example, `uv run check` will lint code.
