- Remove CWE URL from JSON `content` body.
  I don't think it has been very useful over the last year.
  Not exposed in GitLab MRs and just makes the JSON file larger.

### Added

- Add "[cppcheck]" prefix to issue message, to quickly identify the
  tool which produced the warning. May put this in 'engine_name' field
  in the future, but GitLab won't show that in MRs. So prefix the issue
  message for now. (MR !6)
