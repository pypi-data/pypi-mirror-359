UI for darq async task manager - <https://github.com/seedofjoy/darq>

# <img src="./docs/darq_ui.png" alt="Darq UI" width="800"/>

## Installation

[PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/darq-ui/)

```bash
pip install darq-ui
```

Or with extra dependencies:

```bash
pip install darq-ui[aiohttp]
# or
pip install darq-ui[fastapi]
```

## Integration

Use `setup` function like this `from darq_ui.integration.<framework> import setup` to integrate darq-ui with your application.

For example, to integrate with FastAPI:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from darq.app import Darq
from darq_ui.integration.fastapi import setup

app = FastAPI()
darq = Darq()

setup(app, darq)
```

### Web UI

Once you have your server running, you can access the web UI at `http://host:port/darq`.

You can pass the `base_path` parameter to the `setup` function in order to change the base path of the UI.

```python
setup(app, darq, base_path="/my-path")
```

You can disable the web UI by passing `web_ui=False` to the `setup` function (it can be usefull if you want to embed darq_ui and use it only that way).

### Embedding

If you already have a UI (admin UI for example) and you can embed darq-ui into it using `<iframe />`.

```python
setup(app, darq, base_path="/admin/darq", embed=True)
```

`embed=True` will enable special endpoint `/admin/darq/embed` (if you set `base_path="/admin/darq"`).

Then you can use it in an iframe:

```jsx
export const Tasks = () => {
  const url = "http://localhost:3000/admin/darq/embed";
  return <iframe title='Darq UI' style={{ border: '0px' }} src={url} height='100%' width='100%' />;
}
```

### Logging link

If you have a logging system (kibana for example), you can pass `logs_url` to `setup` function. One requirement is that the url should have the `${taskName}` placeholder which will be replaced with the task name.

```python
setup(app, darq, logs_url="https://mylogserver.com/taskname=${taskName}")
```

#### Kibana url example

If you have kibana, you can use the following url:

```
https://kibana.corp/app/discover#/?_g=(time:(from:now-15m,to:now))&_a=(filters:!((('$state':(store:appState),meta:(key:task_name,params:(query:'%22${taskName}%22')),query:(match_phrase:(task_name:â€™${taskName}')))))
```

In this url, `task_name` is a field name and `${taskName}` will be replaced with the task name value. (This is just an example. You
may need to adjust it according to your kibana configuration.)

## Securing the UI

Since darq-ui is a part of your application, and can run any task, you should consider protecting it with authorization middleware or firewall.

## Dropping tasks

Darq UI allows you to drop running tasks. You can only drop a task that is written to work in batches and calls itself at the end.

> For now we can not drop currently running task, only the next one.

```python
BATCH_SIZE = 10

@darq.task
async def notify_users(last_id: int = 0) -> None:
    users = await session.scalars(select(User).where(User.id > last_id).limit(BATCH_SIZE))
    for user in users:
        notify_user(user)

    if len(users) == BATCH_SIZE:
      await notify_users(users[-1].id)
    else:
      log.info("All users notified")
```

In this example, after you `drop` the task, on the next run worker won't run it again by raising an exception.

In order to enable **task dropping**, you need to call special function from `darq_ui` lib in `on_job_prerun` darq callback.

```python
from darq.app import Darq
from darq_ui.darq import maybe_drop_task

darq = Darq(... on_job_prerun=on_job_prerun)

async def on_job_prerun(
    ctx: dict[str, Any],
    arq_function: Any,
    args: Sequence[Any],
    kwargs: Mapping[str, Any],
) -> None:
    # your code here
    await maybe_drop_task(darq, arq_function.name)
```

In the example above, `maybe_drop_task` will check if the task is in the drop list and if so, it will raise `DarqTaskDroppedError` exception.

When you are ready, remove task from droplist in the UI and run task again.

## Examples

In order to run examples you need to install the dependencies:

```bash
cd examples
pdm install
```

And then run the server from the repo root:

```bash
lets run-fastapi 
# or 
lets run-aiohttp
```

* [FastAPI example](examples/fastapi_server.py)
* [Aiohttp example](examples/aiohttp_server.py)

## Development

* pdm package manager - <https://pdm.fming.dev/>
* lets task runner - <https://lets-cli.org>

### Run client build

In root directory run:

`build-ui` will build production version of assets and copy them to `src/darq_ui/static` directory.

```bash
lets build-ui
```

`build-ui-dev` will build and watch development version of assets and copy them to `src/darq_ui/static` directory.

```bash
lets build-ui-dev
```

Now you can run the server and it will serve the UI from the `src/darq_ui/static` directory.

```bash
lets run-fastapi
```

### Run linters, formatters and other checks

```bash
pdm run ruff
pdm run ruff-fmt
pdm run mypy
```

### Changelog

When developing, add notes to `CHANGELOG.md` to `Unreleased` section.

After we decided to release new version, we must rename `Unreleased` to new tag version and add new `Unreleased` section.

## Publishing

`darq-ui` supports semver versioning.

* Update the version number in the `src/darq_ui/__init__.py` file.
* Update the changelog in the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
* Merge changes into master.
* Create a tag `git tag -a v0.0.X -m 'your tag message'`.
* Push the tag `git push origin --tags`.

All of the above steps can be done with the following command:

```bash
lets release <version> -m 'your release message'
```

When new tag pushed, new release action on GitHub will publish new package to pypi.
