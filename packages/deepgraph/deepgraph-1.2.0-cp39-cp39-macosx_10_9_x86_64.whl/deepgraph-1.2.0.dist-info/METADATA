DeepGraph
=========

DeepGraph is a scalable, general-purpose data analysis package. It implements a
`network representation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory>`_ based
on `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_
`DataFrames <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html>`_
and provides methods to construct, partition and plot networks, to interface
with popular network packages and more.

It is based on the network representation introduced
`here <http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00971>`_. DeepGraph is also capable of
representing
`multilayer networks <http://deepgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/terrorists.html>`_.


Main Features
-------------

Utilizing one of Pandas' primary data structures, the
`DataFrame <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html>`_,
DeepGraph represents the (super)nodes of a graph by one (set of) table(s), and their
pairwise relations (i.e. the (super)edges of a graph) by another (set of) table(s).
DeepGraph's main features are

- `Create edges <https://deepgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html#creating-edges>`_:
  Methods that enable an iterative, yet
  vectorized computation of pairwise relations (edges) between nodes using
  arbitrary, user-defined functions on the nodes' properties. The methods
  provide arguments to parallelize the computation and control memory consumption,
  making them suitable for very large data-sets and adjustable to whatever
  hardware you have at hand (from netbooks to cluster architectures).

  Note: the documentation provides a
  `tutorial <https://deepgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/pairwise_correlations.html>`_
  on how to compute large correlation matrices in parallel using DeepGraph.

- `Partition nodes, edges or a graph <https://deepgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html#graph-partitioning>`_:
  Methods to partition nodes,
  edges or a graph by the graphâ€™s properties and labels, enabling the
  aggregation, computation and allocation of information on and between
  arbitrary *groups* of nodes. These methods also let you express
  elaborate queries on the information contained in a deep graph.

- `Interfaces to other packages <https://deepgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html#graph-interfaces>`_:
  Methods to convert to common
  network representations and graph objects of popular Python network packages
  (e.g., SciPy sparse matrices, NetworkX graphs, graph-tool graphs).

- `Plotting <https://deepgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html#plotting-methods>`_:
  A number of useful plotting methods for networks,
  including drawings on geographical map projections using `basemap <https://github.com/matplotlib/basemap>`__.


Quick Start
-----------

The source code is hosted on GitHub at: https://github.com/deepgraph/deepgraph.

Binary installers are available at the
`Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/deepgraph>`_
and on
`conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/deepgraph>`_.

DeepGraph can be installed via pip::

   $ pip install deepgraph

or if you're using `Conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/>`_,
install with::

   $ conda install -c conda-forge deepgraph

Then, import and get started with::

   >>> import deepgraph as dg
   >>> help(dg)
