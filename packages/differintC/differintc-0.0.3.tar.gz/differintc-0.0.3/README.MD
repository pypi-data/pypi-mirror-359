# differintC

`differintC` is a high-performance C++ library with Python bindings for computing fractional differintegrals (derivatives and integrals of arbitrary real order) using numerical methods.

This package implements optimized versions of the Riemann–Liouville and Grünwald–Letnikov (GL) fractional differintegral operators, inspired by the original [DifferInt project](https://github.com/differint/differint).

> ⚙️ Built with modern C++17 and exposed to Python via `pybind11`, this library is significantly faster than pure-Python equivalents, especially for large arrays and high-precision needs.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install differintC
````


---

## 🚀 Usage

```python
from differintC import RLpoint, RL, GLpoint, GL

# Example 1: Riemann–Liouville at a single point
result = RLpoint(0.5, lambda x: x**2)
print("RLpoint(0.5, x^2) =", result)

# Example 2: RL on a whole domain
import numpy as np
x = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
f = x**2
out = RL(0.5, f)

# Example 3: Grünwald–Letnikov pointwise
gl_res = GLpoint(0.5, lambda x: np.sqrt(x))

# Example 4: Full array version (fastest)
gl_array = GL(0.5, lambda x: np.sqrt(x))
```

All functions support either a NumPy array or a Python callable as the `f_name` argument.
