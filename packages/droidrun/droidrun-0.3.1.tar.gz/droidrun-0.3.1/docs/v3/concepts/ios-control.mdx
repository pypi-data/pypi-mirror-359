# üì± iOS Control

DroidRun provides capabilities for controlling and interacting with iOS devices through the iOS Portal, which exposes device automation through a RESTful HTTP API.

## üîå Device Connection

Before controlling an iOS device, establish a connection:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Developer Mode">
    Enable Developer Mode in Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Developer Mode (iOS 16+)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trust Computer">
    Connect via USB and trust your computer when prompted
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install iOS Portal">
    Clone and run the [DroidRun iOS Portal](https://github.com/droidrun/droidrun-ios-portal) via XCode or ./device.sh "iPhone Name"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Connection">
    The portal will start an HTTP server on port 6643 on your iOS device. You can find your device's ip under Settings > Wifi > Info
  </Step>
</Steps>

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool System

DroidRun communicates with iOS devices through HTTP API calls to the portal:

```python
from droidrun import DroidAgent, IOSTools

# Load tools for an iOS device 
tools = IOSTools(url="http://i-phone-ip:6643")

# Create agent with iOS tools
agent = DroidAgent(
    goal="Your task",
    llm=llm,
    tools=tools
)
```

## üñ±Ô∏è Interaction Tools

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Touch Gestures">
    ```python
    # Get indexed clickable elements
    elements = await tools.get_clickables()
    
    # Tap at index
    await tools.tap(index=0)
    
    # Swipe gestures
    await tools.swipe(start_x=100, start_y=200, end_x=100, end_y=300)
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Text Input">
    ```python
    # Type text into focused field
    await tools.input_text(text="Hello world")
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Hardware Keys">
    ```python
    # Press device keys
    await tools.press_key(0)  # Home button
    await tools.press_key(4)  # Action button
    await tools.press_key(5)  # Camera button
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## üì± App Management

Launch and manage iOS applications:

```python
# Launch app by bundle identifier
await tools.start_app("com.apple.mobilesafari")
await tools.start_app("com.example.myapp")
```

## üîç UI Analysis

Extract device state and UI information:

```python
# Get current phone state
state = await tools.get_phone_state()
# Returns: {"current_activity": "com.example.app - Screen Title", "keyboard_shown": false}

# Take screenshot
type, screenshot = await tools.take_screenshot()  # Returns PNG data
# type = "PNG" screenshot = bytes
```

## üß† Memory and Task Management

Store important information for future use:

```python
# Remember important information
await tools_instance.remember("User logged in successfully")

# Get all remembered information
memory = tools_instance.get_memory()

# Mark task as complete
tools_instance.complete(success=True, reason="Task completed successfully")

# Mark task as failed
tools_instance.complete(success=False, reason="Could not complete the task")
```

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Use Coordinate-Based Interactions**
   - The iOS Portal uses coordinate-based tapping and swiping
   - Extract coordinates from accessibility tree or screenshots

2. **Handle App State**
   ```python
   # Check current app state before interactions
   state = await tools.get_phone_state()
   if "com.example.app" in state["activity"]:
       # App is active, proceed with interactions
       pass
   ```

3. **Use Screenshots for Visual Verification**
   ```python
   # Take screenshot to verify UI state
   screenshot = await tools.take_screenshot()
   # Process screenshot for visual confirmation
   ```

## üîß Troubleshooting

1. **Connection Issues**
   - Ensure iOS device is in Developer Mode
   - Check device trust relationship
   - Verify iOS Portal app is installed and running
   - Confirm HTTP server is accessible on port 6643

2. **Interaction Problems**
   - Use correct coordinate system (iOS points, not pixels)
   - Ensure target elements are visible and not covered
   - Check accessibility tree for accurate coordinates

3. **App Control Issues**
   - Use correct bundle identifiers
   - Ensure app is properly installed
   - Check for iOS permission restrictions

## üåê iOS Portal App

The DroidRun iOS Portal is a comprehensive iOS automation portal that provides HTTP API access to iOS device UI state extraction and automated interactions. It consists of two main components:

1. **Portal App** (`droidrun-ios-portal`): A minimal SwiftUI application that serves as the host
2. **Portal Server** (`droidrun-ios-portalUITests`): XCTest-based HTTP server providing automation APIs

The portal runs an HTTP server on port 6643 and offers RESTful endpoints for:
- **UI State Extraction**: Accessibility trees, screenshots, and app state
- **Automation Capabilities**: Touch interactions, gestures, text input, and hardware keys
- **App Management**: Launch apps by bundle identifier and manage app lifecycle
- **Smart Features**: Automatic app switching, keyboard detection, and error handling
