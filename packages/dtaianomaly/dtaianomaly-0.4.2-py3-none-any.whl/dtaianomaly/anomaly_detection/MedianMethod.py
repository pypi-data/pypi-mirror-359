class MedianMethod(BaseDetector):
    """
    Anomaly detection based on the Two-sided Median Method :cite:`basu2007automatic`.

    The Median Method computes the deviation of a sample
    compared to its neighborhood. This neighborhood is computed as a window
    around the sample. The deviation is consequently measured as the number
    of standard deviations the observations deviates from the mean of its
    neighborhood.

    In contrast to the original paper, this implementation allows to define a
    different neighborhood size before and after the sample, to fine tune how
    much lookahead is allowed. In the ultimate case, if ``neighborhood_size_after = 0``,
    then the Median Method is a purely online anomaly detector. Note, however,
    that this case differs from the One-Sided Median Method discussed in the
    original paper, which also uses the first order difference to detect anomalies.

    Parameters
    ----------
    neighborhood_size_before: int
        The number of observations before the sample to include in the neighborhood.
    neighborhood_size_after: int, default=None
        The number of observations after the sample to include in the neighborhood.
        If None, the same value as ``window_size_before`` will be used.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from dtaianomaly.anomaly_detection import MedianMethod
    >>> from dtaianomaly.data import demonstration_time_series
    >>> x, y = demonstration_time_series()
    >>> median_method = MedianMethod(10)  # No fitting is necessary
    >>> median_method.decision_function(x)  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    Notes
    -----
    MedianMethod only handles univariate time series.
