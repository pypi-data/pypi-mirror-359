    Computes the Event-Wise Precision score :cite:`el2024multivariate`.

    Precision measures how accurately the model identifies anomalies.
    For the Event-Wise Precision, the true and false positives are
    considered at the event-level:

    - :math:`TP_e`: the number of ground truth anomalous events that fully or partially
      overlap with a detected segment.
    - :math:`FP_e`: the number of detected segments that do not overlap with any ground
      truth anomalous event.

    The precision is corrected by the false-alarm rate (FAR) to avoid a model which predicts
    all observations as anomalous to have a high score. The FAR is computed on the point-level:

    - :math:`FP`: the number of detected anomalous **points** that are not actually anomalous.

    We then compute the Event-Wise Precision as (with :math:`N`: the total number of normal points):

    Computes the Event-Wise :math:`F_\\beta` score :cite:`el2024multivariate`.

    The :math:`F_\\beta` combines both precision and recall into a single
    value. It provides a balanced evaluation of a modelâ€™s performance,
    especially in anomaly detection, where there is often a trade-off
    between catching all anomalies (high recall) and minimizing false
    alarms (high precision). The parameter :math:`\\beta` controls the balance
    between precision and recall. A :math:`\\beta > 1` gives more weight to
    recall, useful when missing anomalies is costly, while :math:`\\beta < 1`
    emphasizes precision, reducing false positives.

    The :math:`F_\\beta` score is the harmonic mean of the Event-Wise Precision
    and Event-Wise Recall.

    ----------
    beta: int, float, default=1
