    """
    Rescale raw time series to a [0, 1] via min-max scaling. The
    minimum and maximum is computed on a training set, after which
    these values can be used to transform a new time series. Therefore,
    there is no guarantee that the values of the transformed test set
    will actually be in the range [0, 1].

    For multivariate time series, each attribute will be normalized
    independently, i.e., the minimum and maximum of each attribute in
    the transformed time series will 0 and 1, respectively.

    If the minimum and maximum of an attribute is the same (the time
    series consists of only one value), then the transformation will
    not do anything.

    Attributes
    ----------
    min_: array-like of shape (n_attributes)
        The minimum value in each attribute of the training data.
    max_: array-like of shape (n_attributes)
        The maximum value in each attribute of the training data.

    Raises
    ------
    NotFittedError
        If the `transform` method is called before fitting this MinMaxScaler.
