class MovingAverage(Preprocessor):
    """
    Computes the moving average of a time series. This is the unweighted
    average of the observations within a window.

    To compute the moving average at time :math:`t`, the window is centered at
    position :math:`t`. For an odd window size, the number of measurements taken
    before and after :math:`t` is equal (namely ``(window_size - 1 ) / 2``. For an
    even window size, there is one additional observation taken before :math:`t`,
    to ensure a correct window size.

    For multivariate time series, the moving average is computed within
    each attribute independently.

    Parameters
    ----------
    window_size: int
        Length of the window in which the average should be computed.
