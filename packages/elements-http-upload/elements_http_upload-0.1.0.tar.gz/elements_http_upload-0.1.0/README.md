A small convenience command-line utility to upload files via HTTP to an elements instance

The command-line utility provided by this package has been tested with an [ELEMENTS](https://elements.tv/) installation
of v25.1.2. It mimics the upload of the web interface when uploading a file via HTTP(S). The file is split into
chunks and uploaded one by one.
