# Encrypted Text File Search

- Encrypt any `.txt` file (entire file, as a single document).
- Search for a keyword (exact/Boyer-Moore and approximate) in the encrypted text.
- All data is stored only in encrypted form (`data.enc`).

## Usage

1. `pip install cryptography`
2. `python main.py`
3. Encrypt a `.txt` file, then search keywords as you wish!
