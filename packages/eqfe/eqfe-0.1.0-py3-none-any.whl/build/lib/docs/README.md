# Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Environmental Quantum Field Effects (EQFE) project.

## Project Evolution

EQFE represents the rigorous, physics-compliant evolution of earlier consciousness-field research. While the initial Consciousness-Field Hypothesis (CFH) provided valuable insights and inspiration, it contained fundamental theoretical flaws that necessitated a complete reformulation. EQFE maintains the core insight about environmental field effects on quantum correlations while adhering strictly to established physics principles.
