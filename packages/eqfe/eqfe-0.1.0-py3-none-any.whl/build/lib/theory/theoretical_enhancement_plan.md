## Integration Plan

All these enhancements will be integrated into a comprehensive theory document that serves as the authoritative reference for the EQFE framework. This will include:

1. Mathematical appendices with complete derivations
2. Clear specifications of assumptions and limitations
3. Connections to standard quantum field theory and open systems literature
4. Experimental validation requirements with statistical criteria

This enhanced theoretical framework will be completed by August 1, 2025, coinciding with the completion of Phase 1.
