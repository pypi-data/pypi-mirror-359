# Minimal Viable Experiment for EQFE Validation

## Experimental Objective

To provide the si### 2. Enhancement Verification
   - Calculate enhancement factor relative to Markovian baseline using the ratio:
     
     $E_f = \frac{\max_{t \in [0,T]} C_{EQFE}(t)}{\max_{t \in [0,T]} C_{Markov}(t)}$
     
   - Verify statistical significance using bootstrapping:
     1. Generate N=1000 resampled datasets
     2. Calculate enhancement factor for each resampled dataset
     3. Compute 99% confidence interval (p < 0.01)
     4. Verify lower bound of CI exceeds 1.0
     
   - Confirm temporal pattern matches EQFE predictions using reduced chi-square test:
     
     $\chi^2_r = \frac{1}{n-p}\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{[C_{exp}(t_i) - C_{theory}(t_i)]^2}{\sigma_i^2}$
     
     with target $\chi^2_r \leq 1.5$ for acceptable fit

3. **Parameter Dependence Analysis**
   - Extract functional dependence of enhancement on key parameters using non-linear regression
   - For coupling strength (g): fit to theoretical form $E_f(g) = 1 + Ag^2e^{-Bg^4}$ 
   - For correlation time (τ): fit to form $E_f(\tau) = 1 + C\tau/(1+D\tau^2)$
   - For temperature (T): fit to form $E_f(T) = 1 + E(T/T_{opt})^2e^{1-T/T_{opt}}$
   - Compare with EQFE theoretical curves using normalized root-mean-square deviation:
     
     $NRMSD = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}}{\bar{y}}$
     
     with target NRMSD ≤ 0.15 for validationible demonstration of environmental quantum field effects (EQFE) by showing enhanced quantum correlations in a controlled environment with engineered non-Markovian noise.

## Expected Outcomes and Interpretation

1. **Positive Result**: Observation of statistically significant correlation enhancement in parameter regions predicted by EQFE would provide strong initial evidence for the theory.

2. **Negative Result**: Failure to observe enhancement would suggest either:
   - Theoretical refinement of EQFE is needed
   - Experimental parameters are outside the enhancement regime
   - Environmental engineering is insufficient to create required conditions

3. **Partial Result**: Enhancement observed but with different parameter dependence than predicted would indicate need for model refinement while still supporting the core EQFE concept.

This minimal viable experiment establishes a clear, achievable path to testing the fundamental prediction of EQFE while minimizing experimental complexity and resource requirements.
