Dummy client runner

This module implements a stand-alone launcher for stress-testing
an Evennia game. It will launch any number of fake clients. These
clients will log into the server and start doing random operations.
Customizing and weighing these operations differently depends on
which type of game is tested. The module contains a testing module
for plain Evennia.

Please note that you shouldn't run this on a production server!
Launch the program without any arguments or options to see a
full step-by-step setup help.

Basically (for testing default Evennia):

 - Use an empty/testing database.
 - set PERMISSION_ACCOUNT_DEFAULT = "Builder"
 - start server, eventually with profiling active
 - launch this client runner

If you want to customize the runner's client actions
(because you changed the cmdset or needs to better
match your use cases or add more actions), you can
change which actions by adding a path to

   DUMMYRUNNER_ACTIONS_MODULE = <path.to.your.module>

in your settings. See utils.dummyrunner_actions.py
for instructions on how to define this module.

DO NOT RUN THIS ON A PRODUCTION SERVER! USE A CLEAN/TESTING DATABASE!

This stand-alone program launches dummy telnet clients against a
running Evennia server. The idea is to mimic real accounts logging in
and repeatedly doing resource-heavy commands so as to stress test the
game. It uses the default command set to log in and issue commands, so
if that was customized, some of the functionality will not be tested
(it will not fail, the commands will just not be recognized).  The
running clients will create new objects and rooms all over the place
as part of their running, so using a clean/testing database is
strongly recommended.

Setup:
  1) setup a fresh/clean database (if using sqlite, just safe-copy
     away your real evennia.db3 file and create a new one with
     `evennia migrate`)
  2) in server/conf/settings.py, add

        PERMISSION_ACCOUNT_DEFAULT="Builder"

     This is so that the dummy accounts can test building operations.
     You can also customize the dummyrunner by modifying a setting
     file specified by DUMMYRUNNER_SETTINGS_MODULE

  3) Start Evennia like normal, optionally with profiling (--profile)
  4) Run this dummy runner via the evennia launcher:

        evennia --dummyrunner <nr_of_clients>

  5) Log on and determine if game remains responsive despite the
     heavier load. Note that if you activated profiling, there is a
     considerate additional overhead from the profiler too so you
     should usually not consider game responsivity when using the
     profiler at the same time.
  6) If you use profiling, let the game run long enough to gather
     data, then stop the server cleanly using evennia stop or @shutdown.
     @shutdown. The profile appears as
     server/logs/server.prof/portal.prof (see Python's manual on
     cProfiler).

Notes:

The dummyrunner tends to create a lot of accounts all at once, which is
a very heavy operation. This is not a realistic use-case - what you want
to test is performance during run. A large
number of clients here may lock up the client until all have been
created. It may be better to connect multiple dummyrunners instead of
starting one single one with a lot of accounts. Exactly what this number
is depends on your computer power. So start with 10-20 clients and increase
until you see the initial login slows things too much.
