Roleplaying base system for Evennia

Contribution - Griatch, 2015

This module contains the ContribRPObject, ContribRPRoom and
ContribRPCharacter typeclasses.  If you inherit your
objects/rooms/character from these (or make them the defaults) from
these you will get the following features:

- Objects/Rooms will get the ability to have poses and will report
  the poses of items inside them (the latter most useful for Rooms).
- Characters will get poses and also sdescs (short descriptions)
that will be used instead of their keys. They will gain commands
for managing recognition (custom sdesc-replacement), masking
themselves as well as an advanced free-form emote command.

In more detail, This RP base system introduces the following features
to a game, common to many RP-centric games:

- emote system using director stance emoting (names/sdescs).
    This uses a customizable replacement noun (/me, @ etc) to
    represent you in the emote. You can use /sdesc, /nick, /key or
    /alias to reference objects in the room. You can use any
    number of sdesc sub-parts to differentiate a local sdesc, or
    use /1-sdesc etc to differentiate them. The emote also
    identifies nested says and separates case.
- sdesc obscuration of real character names for use in emotes
    and in any referencing such as object.search().  This relies
    on an SdescHandler `sdesc` being set on the Character and
    makes use of a custom Character.get_display_name hook. If
    sdesc is not set, the character's `key` is used instead. This
    is particularly used in the emoting system.
- recog system to assign your own nicknames to characters, can then
    be used for referencing. The user may recog a user and assign
    any personal nick to them. This will be shown in descriptions
    and used to reference them. This is making use of the nick
    functionality of Evennia.
- masks to hide your identity (using a simple lock).
- pose system to set room-persistent poses, visible in room
    descriptions and when looking at the person/object.  This is a
    simple Attribute that modifies how the characters is viewed when
    in a room as sdesc + pose.
- in-emote says, including seamless integration with language
    obscuration routine (such as contrib/rpg/rplanguage.py)

Installation:

Add `RPSystemCmdSet` from this module to your CharacterCmdSet:

```python
# mygame/commands/default_cmdsets.py

# ...

from evennia.contrib.rpg.rpsystem.rpsystem import RPSystemCmdSet  <---

class CharacterCmdSet(default_cmds.CharacterCmdset):
    # ...
    def at_cmdset_creation(self):
        # ...
        self.add(RPSystemCmdSet())  # <---

```

You also need to make your Characters/Objects/Rooms inherit from
the typeclasses in this module:

```python
# in mygame/typeclasses/characters.py

from evennia.contrib.rpg.rpsystem.rpsystem import ContribRPCharacter

class Character(ContribRPCharacter):
    # ...

```

```python
# in mygame/typeclasses/objects.py

from evennia.contrib.rpg.rpsystem.rpsystem import ContribRPObject

class Object(ContribRPObject):
    # ...

```

```python
# in mygame/typeclasses/rooms.py

from evennia.contrib.rpg.rpsystem.rpsystem import ContribRPRoom

class Room(ContribRPRoom):
    # ...

```

Examples:

> look
Tavern
The tavern is full of nice people

*A tall man* is standing by the bar.

Above is an example of a player with an sdesc "a tall man". It is also
an example of a static *pose*: The "standing by the bar" has been set
by the player of the tall man, so that people looking at him can tell
at a glance what is going on.

> emote /me looks at /Tall and says "Hello!"

I see:
    Griatch looks at Tall man and says "Hello".
Tall man (assuming his name is Tom) sees:
    The godlike figure looks at Tom and says "Hello".

Note that by default, the case of the tag matters, so `/tall` will
lead to 'tall man' while `/Tall` will become 'Tall man' and /TALL
becomes /TALL MAN. If you don't want this behavior, you can pass
case_sensitive=False to the `send_emote` function.

Extra Installation Instructions:

1. In typeclasses/character.py:
   Import the `ContribRPCharacter` class:
       `from evennia.contrib.rpg.rpsystem.rpsystem import ContribRPCharacter`
   Inherit ContribRPCharacter:
       Change "class Character(DefaultCharacter):" to
       `class Character(ContribRPCharacter):`
   If you have any overriden calls in `at_object_creation(self)`:
       Add `super().at_object_creation()` as the top line.
2. In `typeclasses/rooms.py`:
       Import the `ContribRPRoom` class:
       `from evennia.contrib.rpg.rpsystem.rpsystem import ContribRPRoom`
   Inherit `ContribRPRoom`:
       Change `class Room(DefaultRoom):` to
       `class Room(ContribRPRoom):`
3. In `typeclasses/objects.py`
       Import the `ContribRPObject` class:
       `from evennia.contrib.rpg.rpsystem.rpsystem import ContribRPObject`
   Inherit `ContribRPObject`:
       Change `class Object(DefaultObject):` to
       `class Object(ContribRPObject):`
4. Reload the server (`reload` or from console: "evennia reload")
5. Force typeclass updates as required. Example for your character:
       `type/reset/force me = typeclasses.characters.Character`
