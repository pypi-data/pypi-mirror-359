# This is an example batch build file for Evennia.

# This version is stripped down to work better with the test system.
# It avoids teleporting the button. For the full version look at the
# other example_batch_cmds.ev file.

# This creates a red button

create/drop button:red_button.RedButton

# This comment ends input for @create
# Next command:

set button/desc =
  This is a large red button. Now and then
  it flashes in an evil, yet strangely tantalizing way.

  A big sign sits next to it. It says:

  ... It really begs to be pressed, doesn't it? You
know you want to!

# This ends the @set command. Note that line breaks and extra spaces
# in the argument are not considered. A completely empty line
# translates to a \n newline in the command; two empty lines will thus
# create a new paragraph. (note that few commands support it though, you
# mainly want to use it for descriptions).
