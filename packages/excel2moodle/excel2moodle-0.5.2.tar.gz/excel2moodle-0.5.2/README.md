# excel 2 Moodle
![Logo](excel2moodleLogo.png "Logo excel2moodle"){width=35%}

This Python program helps to create Moodle questions in less time.
The idea is to write the questions data into a spreadsheet file, from which the program generates the moodle compliant xml Files. 
All questions or a selection of questions can be exported into one xml file to be imported into moodle.

## Concept
The concept is, to store the different questions into categories of similar types and difficulties of questions, for each of which, a separated sheet in the Spreadsheet document should be created.

A `settings` sheet contains global settings to be used for all questions and categories.
Another sheet stores metadata for the different categories of questions.
And each category lives inside a separate sheet inside the spreadsheet document. 

## Getting Started

### Installation
To get started with excel2moodle first have a look at the [installation](https://jbosse3.gitlab.io/excel2moodle/howto.html#excel2moodle-unter-windows-installieren)
If you already have python and uv installed, it is as easy as running `uv tool install excel2moodle`.

### [ Documentation ](https://jbosse3.gitlab.io/excel2moodle/index.html)
Once excel2moodle is installed you can checkout the [example question sheet](https://gitlab.com/jbosse3/excel2moodle/-/tree/master/example?ref_type=heads) 
in the repository.

Some steps are already documented as [ tutorials ](https://jbosse3.gitlab.io/excel2moodle/howto.html)
you can follow along.

And please have a look into the [**user Reference**](https://jbosse3.gitlab.io/excel2moodle/userReference.html)
of the documentation. 
That part explains each part of defining a question.
