# exitcodelib: your new exit code standardization

`exitcodelib` is a Python module for a new standardized exit code list.  
It provides consistent, human-readable meanings for exit codes and tools to work with them safely in scripts or applications.

For more information, view the table below:

| Exit Code | Name                 | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0         | SUCCESS              | Program completed successfully.                                             |
| 1         | UNHANDLED_ERROR      | An unhandled error caused the program to terminate.                         |
| 5         | ABRUPT_TERMINATION   | Program ended without proper exit (e.g. killed, interrupted, panic).        |
| 10        | UNHANDLEABLE_ERROR   | Error was caught by the program, but could not be resolved or recovered.    |

don't, this is just a small ai generated project which will probably never be updated again, I mean look at how tuilib turned out, garbage
