# Technical Summary

The Fabric MCP Server is a Python-based monolithic application designed to act as a bridge between Model Context Protocol (MCP) clients and Daniel Miessler's Fabric AI framework. It will expose Fabric's functionalities (such as pattern listing, execution, and configuration retrieval) as MCP tools. The server will achieve this by consuming the REST API provided by a running `fabric --serve` instance and translating these interactions into MCP-compliant messages. Key architectural goals include robust MCP adherence, clear API translation logic, configurable connectivity to the Fabric API, and support for stdio, Streamable HTTP, and SSE transport protocols for MCP communication, all while ensuring maintainability and ease of operation. The project will leverage the FastMCP library for MCP implementation, `httpx` for Fabric API communication, and `click` for its command-line interface.
