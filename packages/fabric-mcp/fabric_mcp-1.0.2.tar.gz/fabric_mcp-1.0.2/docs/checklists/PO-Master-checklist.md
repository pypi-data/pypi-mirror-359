# Product Owner (PO) Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the Product Owner to validate the complete MVP plan before development execution. The PO should systematically work through each item, documenting compliance status and noting any deficiencies.

## 1. PROJECT SETUP & INITIALIZATION

### 1.1 Project Scaffolding

* `[x]` Epic 1 includes explicit steps for project creation/initialization (Story 1.1 in PRD focuses on verifying and documenting existing scaffolding)
* `[N/A]` If using a starter template, steps for cloning/setup are included (Not using a distinct starter template, but verifying existing setup)
* `[x]` If building from scratch, all necessary scaffolding steps are defined (Story 1.1 covers verification of the current setup which is effectively the "from scratch" base for this project)
* `[x]` Initial README or documentation setup is included (README exists and Story 1.1 includes creating `docs/contributing-cheatsheet.md` and linking)
* `[x]` Repository setup and initial commit processes are defined (if applicable) (Repo exists; `pre-commit` for conventional commits mentioned in PRD Story 1.1)

### 1.2 Development Environment

* `[x]` Local development environment setup is clearly defined (PRD Story 1.1 AC7 refers to `docs/contributing-cheatsheet.md`; Architecture doc also refers to `README.md` and `contributing.md`)
* `[x]` Required tools and versions are specified (Python >=3.11, `uv`, `hatch`, `ruff`, `pytest`, `pre-commit`, `pnpm` in PRD Story 1.1 AC7; Tech Stack in Arch Doc)
* `[x]` Steps for installing dependencies are included (`make bootstrap` mentioned in PRD Story 1.1 AC4; `uv sync` in Arch Doc)
* `[x]` Configuration files (dotenv, config files, etc.) are addressed (`.env.example` in Project Structure; env var config in PRD & Arch Doc)
* `[x]` Development server setup is included (`make dev` for MCP Inspector; `fabric-mcp` CLI for general server start - covered in PRD and Arch Doc)

### 1.3 Core Dependencies

* `[x]` All critical packages/libraries are installed early in the process (PRD Story 1.1 mentions core dev deps; tech stack in Arch Doc lists them)
* `[x]` Package management (npm, pip, etc.) is properly addressed (`uv` for Python; `pnpm` for MCP Inspector)
* `[x]` Version specifications are appropriately defined (PRD Story 1.1 AC2 for Python; Arch Doc Tech Stack for lib versions with `>=` and note to pin)
* `[ ]` Dependency conflicts or special requirements are noted (No specific conflicts noted, but this is an ongoing concern).

## 2. INFRASTRUCTURE & DEPLOYMENT SEQUENCING

### 2.1 Database & Data Store Setup

* `[N/A]` Database selection/setup occurs before any database operations (Server is stateless)
* `[N/A]` Schema definitions are created before data operations
* `[N/A]` Migration strategies are defined if applicable
* `[N/A]` Seed data or initial data setup is included if needed
* `[N/A]` Database access patterns and security are established early

### 2.2 API & Service Configuration

* `[x]` API frameworks are set up before implementing endpoints (FastMCP for MCP, Click for CLI - covered in Epic 1 of PRD)
* `[x]` Service architecture is established before implementing services (Monolithic service architecture defined in PRD Section 5 and Arch Doc)
* `[x]` Authentication framework is set up before protected routes (Fabric API client auth with `FABRIC_API_KEY` established in PRD Story 1.3)
* `[x]` Middleware and common utilities are created before use (`utils.py` exists; specific middleware for FastMCP TBD but structure allows)

### 2.3 Deployment Pipeline

* `[x]` CI/CD pipeline is established before any deployment actions (GitHub Actions for tests/publish exist and noted in Arch Doc)
* `[N/A]` Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is set up before use (Server is an application, not managed infra)
* `[x]` Environment configurations (dev, staging, prod) are defined early (Dev/Prod covered; no explicit staging for server app - Arch Doc & PRD)
* `[x]` Deployment strategies are defined before implementation (PyPI package, run as process - Arch Doc & PRD)
* `[x]` Rollback procedures or considerations are addressed (Deploy previous PyPI version - Arch Doc)

### 2.4 Testing Infrastructure

* `[x]` Testing frameworks are installed before writing tests (`pytest` setup in PRD Story 1.1)
* `[x]` Test environment setup precedes test implementation (Local dev env setup covers this)
* `[x]` Mock services or data are defined before testing (Mocking Fabric API is part of testing strategy in Arch Doc and PRD testing reqs)
* `[x]` Test utilities or helpers are created before use (`tests/unit` and `tests/integration` structure exists)

## 3. EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES & INTEGRATIONS

### 3.1 Third-Party Services

* `[N/A]` Account creation steps are identified for required services (No external services requiring accounts for `fabric-mcp` itself, only for the underlying Fabric instance which is user's responsibility)
* `[x]` API key acquisition processes are defined (`FABRIC_API_KEY` is user-provided for their Fabric instance - documented in PRD & Arch Doc)
* `[x]` Steps for securely storing credentials are included (Handled via env var for `FABRIC_API_KEY` - Arch Doc)
* `[x]` Fallback or offline development options are considered (Fallback for Fabric API is MCP error; offline dev by mocking Fabric API - Arch Doc)

### 3.2 External APIs

* `[x]` Integration points with external APIs are clearly identified (Fabric REST API is the primary one - Arch Doc & PRD)
* `[x]` Authentication with external services is properly sequenced (`FabricApiClient` handles this - PRD Story 1.3 & Arch Doc)
* `[/]` API limits or constraints are acknowledged (Fabric API limits unknown, not explicitly handled by `fabric-mcp` beyond retries - Arch Doc)
* `[x]` Backup strategies for API failures are considered (Retries and reporting MCP errors - Arch Doc)

### 3.3 Infrastructure Services

* `[N/A]` Cloud resource provisioning is properly sequenced (Server is cloud-agnostic app)
* `[N/A]` DNS or domain registration needs are identified
* `[N/A]` Email or messaging service setup is included if needed
* `[N/A]` CDN or static asset hosting setup precedes their use

## 4. USER/AGENT RESPONSIBILITY DELINEATION

### 4.1 User Actions

* `[x]` User responsibilities are limited to only what requires human intervention (e.g., setting `FABRIC_API_KEY`, running `fabric --serve`)
* `[x]` Account creation on external services is properly assigned to users (For Fabric's underlying models like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. - this is outside `fabric-mcp` scope and is Fabric's/user's concern)
* `[N/A]` Purchasing or payment actions are correctly assigned to users
* `[x]` Credential provision is appropriately assigned to users (`FABRIC_API_KEY`)

### 4.2 Developer Agent Actions

* `[x]` All code-related tasks are assigned to developer agents (Implicit in BMAD method, documents prepared for this)
* `[x]` Automated processes are correctly identified as agent responsibilities (CI/CD via GitHub Actions)
* `[x]` Configuration management is properly assigned (Server reads env vars; user sets them)
* `[x]` Testing and validation are assigned to appropriate agents (Dev agents write tests; this PO checklist validates overall plan)

## 5. FEATURE SEQUENCING & DEPENDENCIES

### 5.1 Functional Dependencies

* `[x]` Features that depend on other features are sequenced correctly (Epics in PRD show logical flow, e.g., pattern discovery before execution)
* `[x]` Shared components are built before their use (e.g., `FabricApiClient` in Epic 1 supports later epics)
* `[x]` User flows follow a logical progression (User flows in DX-OPX doc are supported by epic sequence)
* `[x]` Authentication features precede protected routes/features (Fabric API client auth in Epic 1)

### 5.2 Technical Dependencies

* `[x]` Lower-level services are built before higher-level ones (`FabricApiClient` before tool implementations)
* `[x]` Libraries and utilities are created before their use (Core libs in Epic 1)
* `[N/A]` Data models are defined before operations on them (Stateless server, models are Fabric's or MCP's)
* `[x]` API endpoints are defined before client consumption (MCP tool definitions are established, Fabric API endpoints identified)

### 5.3 Cross-Epic Dependencies

* `[x]` Later epics build upon functionality from earlier epics (e.g., Pattern execution in Epic 3 uses discovery from Epic 2 and foundation from Epic 1)
* `[x]` No epic requires functionality from later epics (PRD epic flow seems logical)
* `[x]` Infrastructure established in early epics is utilized consistently (CLI, API client, MCP core from Epic 1 used throughout)
* `[x]` Incremental value delivery is maintained (Each epic delivers a set of usable MCP tools/server capabilities)

## 6. MVP SCOPE ALIGNMENT

### 6.1 PRD Goals Alignment

* `[x]` All core goals defined in the PRD are addressed in epics/stories (PRD Section 1 goals map to functionality in Epics 1-4)
* `[x]` Features directly support the defined MVP goals (MCP tools for pattern interaction, config, etc., directly support integrating Fabric)
* `[x]` No extraneous features beyond MVP scope are included (PRD Section 7 "Out of Scope" is clear)
* `[x]` Critical features are prioritized appropriately (Foundation in Epic 1, then core Fabric interactions)

### 6.2 User Journey Completeness

* `[x]` All critical user journeys are fully implemented (User journeys from DX-OPX doc appear covered by PRD epics/stories)
* `[x]` Edge cases and error scenarios are addressed (Error Handling Strategy in Arch Doc; PRD NFRs for reliability)
* `[x]` User experience considerations are included (DX/OpX goals in PRD Section 4 and DX-OPX-Interaction doc)
* `[x]` Accessibility requirements are incorporated if specified (Accessibility for CLI/MCP DX in DX-OPX doc Section 5)

### 6.3 Technical Requirements Satisfaction

* `[x]` All technical constraints from the PRD are addressed (Python version, libs, no Fabric core changes - covered in PRD Section 5 and Arch Doc)
* `[x]` Non-functional requirements are incorporated (Performance, Reliability, Security, Config, Logging, Deployment from PRD Section 3 addressed in Arch Doc)
* `[x]` Architecture decisions align with specified constraints (Monolith, monorepo, specific libs - Arch Doc reflects PRD)
* `[x]` Performance considerations are appropriately addressed (Async IO, streaming proxy - Arch Doc & PRD)

## 7. RISK MANAGEMENT & PRACTICALITY

### 7.1 Technical Risk Mitigation

* `[/]` Complex or unfamiliar technologies have appropriate learning/prototyping stories (FastMCP is a core dep; SSE handling on both ends needs care. PRD stories focus on impl; assumes learning is part of that).
* `[x]` High-risk components have explicit validation steps (Streaming, Fabric API interaction tested via integration/E2E tests - PRD & Arch Doc testing strategy)
* `[x]` Fallback strategies exist for risky integrations (Fabric API failure leads to MCP error - Arch Doc)
* `[x]` Performance concerns have explicit testing/validation (Streaming efficiency is an NFR; testing strategy covers E2E flows)

### 7.2 External Dependency Risks

* `[x]` Risks with third-party services are acknowledged and mitigated (Fabric API is the main one; mitigation by clear error reporting, retries - Arch Doc)
* `[/]` API limits or constraints are addressed (Fabric API limits unknown; not handled client-side by `fabric-mcp` beyond retries - Arch Doc)
* `[x]` Backup strategies exist for critical external services (Retries for transient Fabric API issues - Arch Doc)
* `[N/A]` Cost implications of external services are considered (Fabric is open source; underlying LLM costs are user's via their Fabric setup)

### 7.3 Timeline Practicality

* `[/]` Story complexity and sequencing suggest a realistic timeline (Epics are logical. Individual story size/complexity seems manageable for MVP, but detailed story breakdown by SM will confirm. 4 Epics for an MVP is substantial).
* `[x]` Dependencies on external factors are minimized or managed (Mainly depends on a running Fabric instance)
* `[x]` Parallel work is enabled where possible (Once Epic 1 is done, some tools in Epics 2-4 could be developed in parallel if resources allow, though there are some dependencies e.g., list_strategies before using strategy_name).
* `[x]` Critical path is identified and optimized (Epic 1 is critical path for any server operation. Subsequent epics build core functionality).

## 8. DOCUMENTATION & HANDOFF

### 8.1 Developer Documentation

* `[x]` API documentation is created alongside implementation (MCP tool definitions in Arch Doc serve as API docs; Fabric API documented in Arch Doc)
* `[x]` Setup instructions are comprehensive (PRD Story 1.1 for `docs/contributing-cheatsheet.md`; `README.md` exists)
* `[x]` Architecture decisions are documented (This `architecture.md` document)
* `[x]` Patterns and conventions are documented (Arch Doc: "Architectural Design Patterns", "Coding Standards")

### 8.2 User Documentation

* `[x]` User guides or help documentation is included if required (`README.md` for users, `docs/contributing-cheatsheet.md` for contributors, CLI `--help`)
* `[x]` Error messages and user feedback are considered (DX-OPX doc and Arch Doc Error Handling)
* `[N/A]` Onboarding flows are fully specified (Server is a tool, not a service with user onboarding)
* `[x]` Support processes are defined if applicable (Open source project, support via GitHub issues/discussions implied in PRD `PM-checklist.md` attachment Section 5.3 NFR)

## 9. POST-MVP CONSIDERATIONS

### 9.1 Future Enhancements

* `[x]` Clear separation between MVP and future features (PRD Section 7 "Out of Scope Ideas Post MVP")
* `[x]` Architecture supports planned future enhancements (Stateless, modular design is generally extensible)
* `[x]` Technical debt considerations are documented (PRD `PM-checklist.md` attachment Section 7.2 "Guidance on technical debt approach provided" is checked as [x])
* `[x]` Extensibility points are identified (e.g., adding new MCP tools to `core.py`, new transport handlers if FastMCP supports more)

### 9.2 Feedback Mechanisms

* `[/]` Analytics or usage tracking is included if required (Not explicitly in MVP. Logging can provide basic usage data.)
* `[x]` User feedback collection is considered (GitHub issues/discussions implied for open-source project - PRD `PM-checklist.md` attachment)
* `[x]` Monitoring and alerting are addressed (Logging for monitoring; alerting external for MVP - Arch Doc)
* `[x]` Performance measurement is incorporated (NFRs for performance; testing strategy implies validation)

### Critical Deficiencies

* None identified. The PRD and Architecture Document appear comprehensive and well-aligned for the MVP scope.

### Recommendations

* Proceed with detailed story drafting by the SM/PO.
* Ensure that when Python package dependencies are finalized in `pyproject.toml`, specific versions are pinned as much as possible, rather than relying on `>=` or `^=`, to ensure stability for AI agent development, as noted in the Architecture Document's Tech Stack section.
* For development, ensure that the unknown aspects of the Fabric API (e.g., exact structure for pattern details if it's more than just system prompt, handling of variables/attachments in `POST /chat`) are clarified early, perhaps by focused integration tests against a live Fabric instance as part of the initial stories in Epics 2 & 3.

### Final Decision

* **APPROVED**: The plan (PRD + Architecture Document) is comprehensive, internally consistent, properly sequenced, and ready for the next steps of detailed story generation and implementation.
