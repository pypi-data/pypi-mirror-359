# Introduction

This document defines the Developer Experience (DX) and Operational Experience (OpX) goals, architecture, flows, and conventions for the Fabric MCP Server. It focuses on its Command Line Interface (CLI), Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool interactions, and overall usability for its technical user personas. It adapts principles from traditional UI/UX design to a backend server context that primarily interacts via CLI and API. All design choices aim to support the goals and requirements outlined in the main Product Requirements Document (PRD).
