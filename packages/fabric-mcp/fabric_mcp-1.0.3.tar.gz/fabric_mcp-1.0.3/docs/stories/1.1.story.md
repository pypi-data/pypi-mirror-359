# Story 1.1: Verify and Document Existing Project Scaffolding

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a Project Maintainer
- I want to verify and document the existing project scaffolding (Python environment, `uv` setup, `pyproject.toml`, basic source layout, development tooling including `pre-commit` and MCP Inspector setup)
- so that it serves as a stable and understood base for further development.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The `pyproject.toml` file accurately defines project metadata (name, dynamic version, description, authors, license).
2. The `pyproject.toml` specifies `requires-python = ">=3.11"`.
3. Core development dependencies (`hatch`, `ruff`, `pytest`, `uv`, `pre-commit`) are correctly listed in `pyproject.toml`.
4. `make bootstrap` successfully sets up/validates the dev environment and pre-commit hooks.
5. Source code directory structure (`src/fabric_mcp/`, `tests/`) is confirmed as per `docs/project-structure.md`.
6. `Makefile` provides functional targets: `bootstrap`, `format`, `lint`, `test`, `coverage`, `build`, `dev`.
7. A new file, `docs/contributing-cheatsheet.md`, is created and populated with a summary of the verified project setup, including Python version, key development tools (`uv`, `ruff`, `pytest`, `hatch`, `pre-commit`, `pnpm` for MCP Inspector), and essential `make` commands, highlighting automated updates and MCP Inspector usage.
8. The main `README.md` is updated to link to `docs/contributing-cheatsheet.md`.
9. The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is implemented and configured for conventional commits and branch protection.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Verify `pyproject.toml` Configuration** (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Check project metadata (name, version from `src/fabric_mcp/__about__.py`, description, authors, license).
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Confirm `requires-python = ">=3.11"`.
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Verify listing of core development dependencies: `hatch`, `ruff`, `pytest`, `uv`, `pre-commit`. Ensure versions align with `docs/tech-stack.md` if specified, otherwise ensure they are sensible modern versions.
- [x] **Task 2: Verify Development Environment Setup** (AC: 4)
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Execute `make bootstrap` and confirm successful completion.
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Verify that `pre-commit` hooks are installed and functional (e.g., by attempting a commit that should trigger a hook).
- [x] **Task 3: Confirm Source Code Directory Structure** (AC: 5)
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Review existing `src/fabric_mcp/` and `tests/` directories against the planned structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Document any minor discrepancies if found.
- [x] **Task 4: Verify `Makefile` Targets** (AC: 6)
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Individually test each `Makefile` target: `bootstrap`, `format`, `lint`, `test`, `coverage`, `build`, `dev`.
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Confirm each target performs its intended action successfully.
- [x] **Task 5: Create `docs/contributing-cheatsheet.md`** (AC: 7)
  - [x] Subtask 5.1: Create the new file `docs/contributing-cheatsheet.md`.
  - [x] Subtask 5.2: Populate it with a summary of:
    - Python version requirement (e.g., ">=3.11").
    - Key development tools used: `uv`, `ruff`, `pytest`, `hatch`, `pre-commit`, `pnpm` (for MCP Inspector).
    - Essential `make` commands and their purpose (e.g., `make bootstrap`, `make test`, `make dev`).
    - Highlight automated updates (e.g., via `pre-commit autoupdate`) and MCP Inspector usage (`make dev`).
- [x] **Task 6: Update `README.md`** (AC: 8)
  - [x] Subtask 6.1: Add a link in the main `README.md` pointing to the new `docs/contributing-cheatsheet.md`.
- [x] **Task 7: Implement and Configure `.pre-commit-config.yaml`** (AC: 9)
  - [x] Subtask 7.1: Ensure `.pre-commit-config.yaml` exists.
  - [x] Subtask 7.2: Configure hooks for conventional commits (e.g., using `commitlint` or a similar tool if not already present and implied by "conventional commits").
  - [x] Subtask 7.3: Configure hooks for branch protection (e.g., ensuring commits are not made directly to `main`/`master`, though this is often a server-side Git setting, document the expectation or local pre-commit checks that support this).
    - *Developer Note: Branch protection might primarily be a Git remote repository setting (e.g., GitHub branch protection rules). The pre-commit hook might check branch name against a pattern.*

## Dev Technical Guidance

- Refer to the existing `pyproject.toml` for metadata and dependency verification.
- Consult the existing `Makefile` for target verification.
- The new `docs/contributing-cheatsheet.md` should be a clear, concise guide for new developers.
- The `README.md` is the main entry point for project information.
- For `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, ensure hooks align with common practices for conventional commits (e.g., [https://www.conventionalcommits.org/](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)). If specific hook configurations are already in place (as implied by existing project structure), verify them. Otherwise, implement standard ones.
- Reference `docs/project-structure.md` for source code layout confirmation.
- Reference `docs/tech-stack.md` for verifying versions of core dev dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
- **File to be created:** `docs/contributing-cheatsheet.md`
- **Files to be modified:** `README.md`, `pyproject.toml` (if discrepancies found), `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (if not fully configured).
