Example demonstrating the isolate_imports context manager with multiple concurrent runners.

This shows how to:
1. Isolate imports for a specific package path
2. Execute functions in a forked process
3. Use multiple concurrent import runners

Run this with:
    python demopackage/test_hotreload.py
"""

import time

from firehot import isolate_imports


# A global function to demonstrate execution in a forked process

    A simple function that will be executed in the forked process.

    :param msg: A message to print
    :param count: Number of times to print the message

    :return: A completion message
