## Testing Flowmark

Most comprehensive testing is done via the test files in the tests/testdocs directory.

The input is tests/testdocs/testdoc.orig.md.

The expected output is in tests/testdocs/testdoc.out.*.md.

When you run `make test`, the actual output from the code is written to tests/testdocs/testdoc.actual.*.md.

The test passes if the actual output matches the expected output.

If they do NOT match, it is a bug and the test fails.
After a failure, the testdoc.actual.*.md files are still updated and can be
compared to the expected testdoc.out.*.md files to understand what went wrong.

DO NOT change the testdoc.out.*.md files since they should be the expected output.

Change the code to fix bugs until the testdoc.actual.*.md files match the expected testdoc.out.*.md files.
