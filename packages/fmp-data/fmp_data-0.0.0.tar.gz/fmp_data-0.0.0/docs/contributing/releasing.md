# Release Management

This guide explains how releases are managed for the FMP Data project, including versioning strategy, automated processes, and manual procedures.

## Semantic Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) with automated version bumping based on PR labels.

### Version Format

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PRERELEASE][+BUILD]
```

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes that require user action
- **MINOR**: New features that are backward compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes and minor improvements
- **PRERELEASE**: Alpha, beta, or release candidate versions
- **BUILD**: Build metadata (not used in our releases)

### Version Bumping Rules

| Change Type | PR Label | Version Bump | Example |
|-------------|----------|--------------|---------|
| Breaking Changes | `major` | MAJOR | 1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0 |
| New Features | `minor` | MINOR | 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0 |
| Bug Fixes | `patch` | PATCH | 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1 |
| Documentation | `patch` | PATCH | 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1 |
| Chores | `patch` | PATCH | 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1 |

## Automated Release Process

### GitHub Actions Workflow

Our release process is fully automated using GitHub Actions:

1. **PR Merge**: When a PR is merged to `main`
2. **Label Detection**: Action reads PR labels to determine version bump
3. **Version Calculation**: New version is calculated based on current version + bump type
4. **Git Tagging**: New git tag is created with the version
5. **Release Creation**: GitHub release is created with auto-generated notes
6. **PyPI Publishing**: Package is built and published to PyPI
7. **Documentation**: Updated docs are deployed

### Required PR Labels

**Version Bump Labels** (exactly one required):
- `major`: For breaking changes
- `minor`: For new features
- `patch`: For bug fixes and minor changes

**Additional Labels** (optional):
- `dependencies`: Dependency updates
- `documentation`: Documentation changes
- `enhancement`: Improvements to existing features
- `bug`: Bug fixes
- `feature`: New features

### Example Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      - name: Install Poetry
        uses: snok/install-poetry@v1

      - name: Determine Version Bump
        uses: ./.github/actions/version-bump
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build and Publish
        env:
          PYPI_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          poetry config pypi-token.pypi $PYPI_TOKEN
          poetry build
          poetry publish
```

## Manual Release Process

For emergency releases or when automation fails:

### Prerequisites

1. **Permissions**: Maintainer access to repository and PyPI
2. **Environment**: Local development environment set up
3. **Credentials**: PyPI token configured

### Steps

1. **Prepare Release Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b release/v1.2.3
   ```

2. **Update Version**
   ```bash
   # Update version in pyproject.toml if needed
   poetry version patch  # or minor/major
   ```

3. **Update Changelog**
   ```bash
   # Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
   # Include all changes since last release
   ```

4. **Run Quality Checks**
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest
   poetry run black .
   poetry run ruff check .
   poetry run mypy fmp_data
   poetry run mkdocs build --strict
   ```

5. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: prepare release v1.2.3"
   git push origin release/v1.2.3
   ```

6. **Create Release PR**
   - Create PR from release branch to main
   - Add appropriate version label
   - Include release notes in description

7. **Merge and Tag**
   ```bash
   # After PR approval and merge
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git tag v1.2.3
   git push origin v1.2.3
   ```

8. **Build and Publish**
   ```bash
   poetry build
   poetry publish
   ```

9. **Create GitHub Release**
   - Go to GitHub Releases
   - Create release from tag
   - Add release notes
   - Publish release

## Pre-release Process

For alpha, beta, and release candidate versions:

### Creating Pre-releases

```bash
# Alpha release
poetry version prerelease  # 1.0.0a1

# Beta release
poetry version 1.0.0b1

# Release candidate
poetry version 1.0.0rc1
```

### Publishing Pre-releases

```bash
# Build and publish to PyPI
poetry build
poetry publish

# Install pre-release
pip install --pre fmp-data
```

### Pre-release Labels

- `alpha`: Early development version
- `beta`: Feature-complete but may have bugs
- `rc`: Release candidate, final testing phase

## Release Notes

## Version Strategy

### Major Releases (X.0.0)

**When to Release**:
- Breaking API changes
- Major architecture changes
- Dropping support for Python versions
- Significant dependency updates

**Planning**:
- Create milestone for major version
- Gather breaking changes over time
- Provide migration documentation
- Consider deprecation warnings in previous minor versions

### Minor Releases (X.Y.0)

**When to Release**:
- New features
- New API endpoints
- Backward-compatible improvements
- New optional dependencies

**Frequency**: Monthly or when significant features are ready

### Patch Releases (X.Y.Z)

**When to Release**:
- Bug fixes
- Documentation updates
- Security fixes
- Performance improvements

**Frequency**: As needed, typically weekly for active development

## Hotfix Process

For critical security or data corruption bugs:

1. **Create Hotfix Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b hotfix/security-fix
   ```

2. **Apply Minimal Fix**
   - Fix only the critical issue
   - Avoid unrelated changes
   - Add regression tests

3. **Fast-track Release**
   - Skip normal review process if needed
   - Deploy immediately after testing
   - Notify users through appropriate channels

4. **Post-hotfix Actions**
   - Backport to development branches
   - Update documentation
   - Conduct post-mortem if needed
