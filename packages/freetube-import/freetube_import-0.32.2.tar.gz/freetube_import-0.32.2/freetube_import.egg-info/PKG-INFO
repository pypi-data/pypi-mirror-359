# Freetube-import
Creates [FreeTube](https://freetubeapp.io/) .db playlist files from a list of youtube urls (.txt) or from .csv files exported from 'Google takeout'.

Run the scrip with a path to a valid .txt file of youtube urls, or youtube's .csv playlist file. Then import the resulting .db file into FreeTube.



Install via pip:

      pip install freetube-import

https://pypi.org/project/freetube-import/

usage:

      freetube-import <file>... <file2> <file3>

Or if you prefer just cloning the script.

      python freetube_import.py <file>... <file2> <file3>



Help message:

      usage: freetube-import [-h] [-l] [-a] [filepath ...]
      Import youtube playlists
      positional arguments:
        filepath          path to a valid .txt or .csv playlist file or files
      options:
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        -a, --list-all        Takes all .txt and csv files as input from the current working directory.
        -b, --list-broken-videos
                        Lists videos that were added but have possibly broken metadata (for debugging).
        -e, --log-errors      Also lists the videos that failed the metadata fetch

Works without YouTube api through a custom version of [YouTube-search library](https://github.com/joetats/youtube_search/). Also works atleast on piped links, probably also on lists of Invidious links and other links that follow the standard youtube url format.
