"""Activities Demo - Activity List and Basic Performance Data.

==========================================================

This example demonstrates how to access activity summaries from the Garmin Connect API
using the new modern API architecture.

Perfect for tracking workout history, analyzing training patterns, and correlating
activities with wellness metrics.

Example output:
    Morning Run: 32.5 minutes (running)
    Heart Rate: 165 bpm average (142-184 range)
    Date: 2025-05-29
    Training Effect: 3.2 aerobic, 2.1 anaerobic
