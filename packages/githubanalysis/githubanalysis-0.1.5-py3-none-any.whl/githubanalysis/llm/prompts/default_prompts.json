Your task is to analyze the entire project history and provide a comprehensive, detailed analysis of AT LEAST THREE significant technical challenges of the project. Each challenge should be thoroughly described with its attempts at solution and current status, following the exact format provided. Use the detailed code analysis provided to identify patterns, impacts, and relationships between changes.",

For each challenge, follow this EXACT structure:\n\n## Issue: [Specific Technical Challenge Title]\n\n[Write a detailed paragraph describing the technical challenge, its context, and why it was difficult. Include specific technical details about the complexity and impact. Reference specific commits with their detailed analysis (impact scores, security/performance impacts, API changes, etc.) that introduced or modified this challenge.]\n\n[Write another paragraph explaining the key difficulties and technical complexities involved. Include specific technical challenges and their implications. Reference relevant commits with their detailed analysis that show the evolution of these challenges.]\n\n### Attempts to Solve the Problem\n\n[First Attempt Name] (Commit: [commit-hash], Impact: [score], Security: [score], Performance: [score]): [Write a detailed paragraph describing the first technical approach, including:\n- The specific technical solution attempted\n- Why it was chosen\n- What worked and what didn't\n- Technical limitations encountered\n- Reference the specific commit that implemented this attempt with its detailed analysis]\n\n[Second Attempt Name] (Commit: [commit-hash], Impact: [score], Security: [score], Performance: [score]): [Write a detailed paragraph describing the second technical approach, including:\n- The specific technical solution attempted\n- Why it was chosen\n- What worked and what didn't\n- Technical limitations encountered\n- Reference the specific commit that implemented this attempt with its detailed analysis]\n\n[Third Attempt Name] (Commit: [commit-hash], Impact: [score], Security: [score], Performance: [score]): [Write a detailed paragraph describing the third technical approach, including:\n- The specific technical solution attempted\n- Why it was chosen\n- What worked and what didn't\n- Technical limitations encountered\n- Reference the specific commit that implemented this attempt with its detailed analysis]\n\n### Status as of [Current Date]: [Current Status]\n\n[Write a detailed paragraph describing the current status, including:\n- Whether the issue is solved, abandoned, or in progress\n- Current technical state and challenges\n- Next steps if still in progress\n- Technical improvements needed\n- Reference the most recent commit related to this issue with its detailed analysis]\n\n[Repeat similar structure for Challenge 2 and 3. If more than three challenges are found, include them as well, but NEVER less than three.]\n\nIMPORTANT: When referencing a commit hash, ALWAYS wrap it in backticks, e.g., `7c2004bf`."
