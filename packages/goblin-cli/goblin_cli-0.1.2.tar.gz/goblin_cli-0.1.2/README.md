# Unit Test Goblin 🧪👹

A CLI tool that analyzes your unit tests and codebase to detect weak test coverage, redundant cases, and untested logic paths. Because your tests _aren’t as good as you think_.

![Goblin CLI Output](./assets/goblin-cli-screenshot.png)

## Why?

Most test suites lie. They pass when they shouldn't, cover when they shouldn't, and leave edge cases to die in the cold. Goblin helps you:

- Spot meaningless tests
- Identify missing assertions
- Catch untested edge cases

## MVP Features

- Parse code and test files
- Detect empty or redundant tests
- Identify missing logical branches
- Suggest better coverage

## Usage (soon)

```bash
$ goblin analyze ./path/to/your/code
```
