# GraceGit
*Grace's Great Git Abstraction*

I was somewhat fed up with typing multiple commands for every push I made
so I made a gitpython wrapper in order to make my life a little less
annoying. I know it is not the best Git hygiene, but it is what my workflow
is.

## Install instructions

Simpily run the following command, and then use the new `gg` command
```
pip install gracegit
```
