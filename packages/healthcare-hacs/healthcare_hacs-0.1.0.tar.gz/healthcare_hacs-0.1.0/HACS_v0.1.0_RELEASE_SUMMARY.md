## 🚀 **Ready for Production**

### **Installation**
```bash
# Development (current)
git clone https://github.com/voa-health/hacs.git
cd hacs && uv sync

# Production (PyPI ready)
uv add hacs-core hacs-models  # Core functionality
uv add hacs-tools             # CRUD + protocol adapters
uv add hacs-cli               # Complete CLI experience
```

### **Quick Start**
```python
from hacs_models import Patient, AgentMessage
from hacs_core import Actor, MemoryBlock, Evidence
from hacs_tools import CreateResource
from hacs_tools.adapters import convert_to_mcp_task

# Create physician actor
physician = Actor(
    id="physician-001",
    name="Dr. Sarah Johnson",
    role="physician",
    permissions=["*:*"],
    is_active=True
)

# Create and store patient
patient = Patient(
    id="patient-001",
    given=["Ana", "Maria"],
    family="Silva",
    gender="female",
    birth_date=date(1985, 3, 15)
)

patient_id = CreateResource(patient, actor=physician)
# ✅ Patient created with Actor security

# Export to MCP protocol
mcp_task = convert_to_mcp_task("create", resource=patient, actor=physician)
# ✅ Protocol adapter integration ready
```
