# Step 1 — HACS Proof‑of‑Concept 🏗️

> **Objective:** ship a runnable *v0.1.0* in **one week**.
> Scope is intentionally thin: *typed core models + JSON‑Schema export + FHIR round‑trip + CLI validator*.  Everything else can iterate later.

## 2 Tech Snapshot (2025‑06)

* **Python ≥3.10**  🏃 more features, same wheels on Debian + macOS.
* **Pydantic 2.7**  fast, typed, inline JSON‑Schema.
* **Pyright** instead of Mypy for instant type feedback (VSCode friendly).
* **Ruff** ≥0.4 for lint *and* formatting (`ruff format`). No Black/Iso rt.
* **UV** for ultra-fast multi-package workspace management (10-100x faster than pip).
* **GitHub Actions** matrix: 3.10–3.13; cache UV envs.
* **fhir.resources 7.3** (R5). R6 draft stays on a branch.

> **Keep friction low:** pre‑commit is optional, 80 % test coverage is *goal* not gate.

## 5 Collaboration Guidelines (lightweight)

* **Branch naming:** `feat/<short>` or `fix/<short>` – no bikeshedding.
* **PR size:** <400 lines preferred; larger allowed if urgent.
* **Reviews:** 1 LGTM from *any* maintainer → merge. No mandatory squash.
* **Style:** run `ruff check && ruff format .` before pushing; CI will auto‑fix trivial stuff.
* **Docs:** update README if CLI UX changes.

🚫 **Do *not*** add heavy frameworks, extra Makefile targets, or git‑hook blockers in this step.

---

## 6 Acceptance Criteria

* **Core Models:** All agent-centric models (BaseResource, MemoryBlock, Evidence, Actor) validate and serialize correctly.
* **FHIR Integration:** Round‑tripping Patient/Encounter/Observation → FHIR → HACS preserves all data.
* **CRUD Operations:** CreateResource, ReadResource, UpdateResource, DeleteResource work with validation guards.
* **Memory System:** Memory blocks can be stored, recalled, and linked with proper typing.
* **Evidence System:** Evidence can be created, searched, and linked to resources with provenance.
* **CLI Functionality:** All commands work: validate, convert, memory, evidence operations.
* **Protocol Foundations:** MCP, A2A, AG-UI adapters can format HACS resources correctly.
* **Installation:** All packages install via `uv add hacs-cli==0.1.0` on 3 OS images.
* **Documentation:** README demonstrates end-to-end agent workflows in <60s.
* **Integration:** Cross-package workflows (create → validate → convert → store) work seamlessly.

## 7 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk              | Plan                                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope creep** | Fixed 10-day timeline; cut nice-to-haves first if needed |
| **Pydantic ABI jump** | Pin 2.7.\*, add CI alert on 2.8 release        |
| **FHIR lib lag** | Wrap import in shim → drop‑in replace later    |
| **Protocol complexity** | Start with stub implementations, iterate in v0.2+ |
| **Memory/Evidence abstractions** | Keep simple dict-based storage for v0.1.0 |
| **Cross-package dependencies** | UV workspace handles this; test thoroughly |
| **CLI complexity** | Use Typer + Rich for good UX; comprehensive help |
| **Integration testing** | Dedicate full Day 10 to end-to-end validation |
