## hetGPy: Heteroskedastic Gaussian Process Modeling in Python

`hetGPy` is a Python implementation of the `hetGP` R library. Please see our [JOSS paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.07518) for an in-depth introduction to the package.

This package has the goals of:
*	Matching the behavior of the `R` package
*	Having minimal Python and external dependencies, which are:
    * `numpy` and `scipy` for computations
    * `matplotlib` for visualization
    * `joblib` for parallelization
    * `tqdm` for progress bars
    * `Eigen` (C++) for fast calculations (when vectorization is non-obvious)

The motivation for such a package is due to the rising popularity of implementing simulation models (also known as computer experiments) in Python. 

## Documentation

The package documentation is available at: https://hetgpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Installing and Environments


### pypi

* `hetGPy` is available on pypi:

```
pip install hetgpy
```

### Development Version:

```
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/davidogara/hetGPy.git
```

* To build from the source files:

1. Clone the repository. Make sure to include `--recurve-submodules` if you do not already have `Eigen` installed on your system:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/davidogara/hetGPy.git
```

2. With `hetGPy` as your current working directory:
```
pip install -e .
```

We recommend installing in a virtual environment. One way to do this with `venv` is:
```
python3.10 -m venv .venv
```

After this you should be able to run the examples in the `examples` folder.



## Note on Dependencies
*	`hetGPy` requires `scipy>=1.14.0` which fixed a [memory leakage issue](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/20768) when using `L-BFGS-B` in `scipy.optimize.minizmize`. That version of scipy requires Python 3.10. 

*	Since `hetGPy` is designed for large-scale problems, this was chosen as a necessary feature. Experienced users may be able to roll back some of the dependencies, but this is not the recommended use.

*	`hetGPy` also requires a c++17 compiler and [`Eigen`](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) for the underlying covariance functions. Eigen 3.4.0 is included with the source files (and is a submodule of the git repository), but experienced users may wish to link against their own installation.
