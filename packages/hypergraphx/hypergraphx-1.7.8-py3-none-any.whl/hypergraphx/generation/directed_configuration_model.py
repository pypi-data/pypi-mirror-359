    """
    This function implements the directed configuration model to generate
    random hyperedges based on the given hypergraph. It ensures that each node's
    in-degree and out-degree are preserved in the generated hypergraph.
    The number of hyperedges is preserved.
    Head and tail size is preserved for each hyperedge.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hypergraph : DirectedHypergraph
        The input hypergraph.

    Returns
    -------
    DirectedHypergraph
        The generated hypergraph.
