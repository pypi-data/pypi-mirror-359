    Generate a scale-free hypergraph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_nodes : int
        The number of nodes in the hypergraph.
    edges_by_size : dict
        A dictionary mapping the size of the hyperedges to the number of hyperedges of that size.
    scale_by_size : dict
        A dictionary mapping the size of the hyperedges to the scale parameter of the exponential distribution.
    correlated : bool
        Whether the exponential distributions of the different sizes should be correlated.
    corr_target : float
        The target correlation between the exponential distributions of the different sizes.
    num_shuffles : int

    Returns
    -------
    Hypergraph
        A scale-free hypergraph with the given number of nodes and hyperedges for each size.
