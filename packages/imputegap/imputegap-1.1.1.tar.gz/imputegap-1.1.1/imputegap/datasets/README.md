## Climate

The Climate dataset is an aggregated and processed collection used for climate change attribution studies.
It contains observations data for 18 climate agents across 125 locations in North America [USC Melady Lab](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~liu32/data.html).
The dataset has a temporal granularity of 1 month, comprising 10 series with 5,000 values each.
This structure is particularly valuable for spatio-temporal modeling [Spatial-temporal causal modeling for climate change attribution](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1557019.1557086), as it enables researchers to account for both spatial and temporal dependencies.

## fMRI-Stoptask

The fMRI-Stoptask dataset was obtained from the OpenfMRI database, with the accession number ds000007. This dataset is an extraction of a fMRI scan of Visual where subjects performed a stop-signal task with one of three response types: manual response, spoken letter naming, and spoken pseudo word naming.
Following the same conversion hypothesis as used for the object recognition dataset, the fMRI-Stoptask dataset was extracted from the first run of subject 1. Voxels with values of 0 were removed, and the total number of voxels was reduced to 10,000 after flattening the dimensions. This resulted in a dataset comprising 10,000 series, each containing 182 values.
The fMRI-Stoptask dataset will emphasize brain activity in regions such as the right inferior frontal gyrus and the basal ganglia, illustrating neural mechanisms of inhibition commonly associated with stop-signal tasks.

## Motion

The motion dataset consists of time series data collected from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, capturing attributes such as attitude, gravity, user acceleration, and rotation rate [[4]](#ref4). Recorded at a high sampling rate of 50Hz using an iPhone 6s placed in users' front pockets, the data reflects various human activities. While the motion time series are non-periodic, they display partial trend similarities.

## Soccer

The soccer dataset, initially presented in the DEBS Challenge 2013 [[3]](#ref3), captures player positions during a football match. The data is collected from sensors placed near players' shoes and the goalkeeper's hands. With a high tracking frequency of 200Hz, it generates 15,000 position events per second. Soccer time series exhibit bursty behavior and contain numerous outliers.
