Manage your Insiders projects.

## Installation

```bash
pip install insiders
```

With [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv tool install insiders
```

## Usage

The `insiders` tool provides several commands that will help you manage projects based on a sponsorware strategy.

- `insiders backlog`: Print a backlog of issues, ordered using your own defined criteria
- `insiders index`: Serve a PyPI-like index locally, and upload private Insiders packages to it.
- `insiders project`: Bootstrap public/insiders project pairs on GitHub.
- `insiders sponsors`: Manage your sponsors (grant/revoke access to private team, etc.).

Run `insiders -h` to see where the configuration file is found. Example configuration:

```toml

# Backlog configuration.                                                      #
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# The `backlog` command prints a list of issues from GitHub repositories.
# It is used to keep track of what needs to be done, and to prioritize tasks.
[backlog]
