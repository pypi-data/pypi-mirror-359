# IP Fabric Extensions 

## IP Fabric

[IP Fabric](https://ipfabric.io) is a vendor-neutral network assurance platform that automates the 
holistic discovery, verification, visualization, and documentation of 
large-scale enterprise networks, reducing the associated costs and required 
resources whilst improving security and efficiency.

It supports your engineering and operations teams, underpinning migration and 
transformation projects. IP Fabric will revolutionize how you approach network 
visibility and assurance, security assurance, automation, multi-cloud 
networking, and trouble resolution.

**Integrations or scripts should not be installed directly on the IP Fabric VM unless directly communicated from the
IP Fabric Support or Solution Architect teams.  Any action on the Command-Line Interface (CLI) using the root, osadmin,
or autoboss account may cause irreversible, detrimental changes to the product and can render the system unusable.**
