# Joymote

Use a Joy-Con or Pro Controller as a remote control of your Linux machine.

Joy-Con and Pro Controller can be connected to Linux machine via Bluetooth. Joymote listens for button presses and analog stick movements, then translates them into keyboard input, mouse movement, or custom commands defined by you. With Joymote, your game controller becomes a powerful input device for controlling your desktop.

## Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [uinput module](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.12/input/uinput.html)
  - Check whether the `uinput` module is loaded, by running:

    ```bash
    lsmod | grep uinput
    ```

    If it is loaded, you will see a line like `uinput                 20480  0`.
  - You can manually load the module by running:

    ```bash
    sudo modprobe uinput
    ```

  - You can also run the following command to load `uinput` modules automatically on boot.

    ```bash
    sudo bash -c "cat uinput > /etc/modules-load.d/uinput.conf"
    ```

  - Make sure you have the permission to access `/dev/uinput`.

## Installation

### Using pip

```bash
pip install joymote
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kkoyung/joymote.git joymote
cd joymote
# check out different version by tags, if you want
pip install .
```

## Usage

1. Copy the example configuration file to `~/.config/joymote/config.toml`.

    ```bash
    wget -o ~/.config/joymote/config.toml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkoyung/joymote/refs/heads/main/config.toml
    ```

2. [Connect controllers via Bluetooth](#connect-controllers-via-bluetooth).
3. Start `joymote`.

    ```bash
    joymote
    ```

4. By default, Joymote does nothing. Check out `config.toml` and change it to configure Joymote's behaviours upon pressing buttons on the controller.

> Joymote can detect newly connected controllers without restarting, so you can run it as daemon in the background. For example, run it as a systemd unit.

## Connect controllers via Bluetooth

The controllers can connect to your Linux machine via Bluetooth, just like usual Bluetooth devices.

1. Press and hold down the SYNC button (the tiny button between SL and SR on Joy-Con, or the tiny button between L and R button on Pro Controller) for at least one second to enter pairing mode.
2. Enable Bluetooth of your computer, and scan new devices.
3. Find a device named "Joy-Con (L)", "Joy-Con (R)", or "Pro Controller". Pair and connect to it.

## Development

1. Clone the repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kkoyung/joymote.git joymote
    cd joymote
    ```

2. Run the code.

    ```bash
    uv run joymote
    # or
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python install .
    python -m joymote
    ```

## Pairing two Joy-Con as one device (Optional)

Use [joycond](https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/joycond), which is a userspace daemon, to combine Joy-Cons into a single device.

- Install and start. For example, if you are on Arch Linux, you can run

  ```bash
  yay -S joycond-git
  sudo systemctl enable --now joycond
  ```

- Then, follow [this instruction](https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/joycond?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) to pair the controller.
