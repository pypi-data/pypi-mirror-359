### 🎉 Initial Release

**kfp-doctor** - A comprehensive linter for healthy Kubeflow Pipelines with advanced analysis and auto-fix capabilities.

#### 🚀 Core Features

**Pipeline Linting (10 Comprehensive Checks)**
- **Resource Validation**: Missing/excessive CPU and memory requests, resource limits
- **Security Checks**: Privileged containers, root users, hardcoded secrets, registry validation
- **Best Practices**: Latest image tags, retry policies, unused components
- **Configurable**: All checks can be enabled/disabled with custom severity levels

**Advanced Analysis**
- **💰 Cost Analysis**: Per-component cost estimation with hourly/daily/monthly breakdowns
- **⚡ Performance Insights**: Bottleneck detection, resource imbalance identification
- **📈 Complexity Metrics**: Pipeline complexity scoring and dependency analysis
- **⏱️ Runtime Estimation**: Predicted execution time based on resource allocation

**Auto-fix Capabilities**
- **🔧 Automatic Fixes**: 20+ different auto-fixes for common pipeline issues
- **Safe Operations**: Dry-run mode and automatic backup creation
- **Smart Fixes**: Missing resources, security contexts, image tags, retry policies, secrets

**Smart Configuration**
- **🎯 Environment Templates**: Pre-built configs for development, staging, production, security-focused, and cost-optimized environments
- **📊 Pipeline Analysis**: Intelligent configuration recommendations based on your specific pipeline
- **🔄 Template System**: Easy customization and extension
