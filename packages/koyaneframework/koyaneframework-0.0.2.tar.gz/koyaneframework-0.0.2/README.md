 Koyane-Framework :: wordlist forge & analysis toolkit
 made by Puppetm4ster
```                   


**Koyane** is a modular framework for generating, editing, and analyzing wordlists, designed for password cracking and ethical security testing.  
The project is named after *Ame-no-Koyane*, a kami (deity) in Japanese mythology associated with structure, ritual, and the power of words.

## Installation

### ðŸ“¦ From pypi (Recommended)

You can install the latest build directly with pip:

```bash
pip install koyaneframework
```

## Status: Pre-Alpha

The project is in a very early stage of development. Functionality is limited and subject to change.
This is my very first coding project so i am grateful for every improvement suggestion at **puppetma4ster@proton.me**
I try to update the project once a week.

## Features

+ Basic wordlist analysis (line count, word length stats, complexity metrics)
+ Charset-based generation with configurable min/max length
+ Partial support for mask-based generation
+ Basic wordlist sorting
+ CLI interface powered by Typer
+ Basic status messages

**Not yet implemented:**

- Word mutation, filtering, or combinator logic
- Deduplication and merging
- TUI or rich CLI frontend
- Performance optimizations (parallelization, mmap, low-level backend)
- Contextual generation based on target information (name, location, job, hobbies, birthday...)
- extract and build rules out of wordlists
- Mask generation supports wildcards such as ?d for digits,
  and fixed character segments using ! (e.g. !A for 'A', !abc123 for custom sets).
- Search functionality for wordlists (like `search type:ftp` in Metasploit).
- Building a console version of Koyane with **prompt_toolkik**

---

## Goals

Koyane aims to become a fast, modular, and scriptable framework for:

- Wordlist generation using rules, masks, templates, and personal context
- Large-scale list manipulation and cleanup
- Format conversion and statistical inspection
- Efficient pipelines for password audit and red team workflows

## Example Usage

```bash
koyane generate --min 4 --max 6 --char-set abc123 output_wordlist.txt
koyane generate --min 1 --max 8 --char-file charset.txt output_wordlist.txt
koyane generate --mask ?L?v?l?l?l?d?d?p output_wordlist.txt
koyane generate --min 5 --mask ?L?v?l?l?l?d?d?p output_wordlist.txt
koyane analyze wordlist.txt
```
