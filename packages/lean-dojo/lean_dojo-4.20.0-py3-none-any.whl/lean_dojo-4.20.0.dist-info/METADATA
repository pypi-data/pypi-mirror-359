LeanDojo: Machine Learning for Theorem Proving in Lean
======================================================

![LeanDojo](https://github.com/lean-dojo/LeanDojo/blob/main/images/LeanDojo.jpg)

[LeanDojo](https://leandojo.org/) is a Python library for learningâ€“based theorem provers in Lean, providing two main features:

* Extracting data (proof states, tactics, premises, etc.) from Lean repos.
* Interacting with Lean programmatically.

LeanDojo's current version is compatible with Lean 4 `v4.3.0-rc2` or later. We strongly suggest using the current version. However, you may use the [`legacy`](https://github.com/lean-dojo/LeanDojo/tree/legacy) branch if you want to work with earlier versions (including Lean 3).
