lkcom is a collection of small, common and useful routines for reading, parsing,
plotting, and analyzing hobbyist and scientific lab data. Its purpose is to
make common data handling steps fast and pythonic.

lkcom is a lighter and at this point better version of [lklib]
(https://test.pypi.org/project/lklib/).

lkcom is also used in [pynlomic](https://pypi.org/project/pynlomic/) and 
[pynlopol](https://pypi.org/project/pynlopol/).
