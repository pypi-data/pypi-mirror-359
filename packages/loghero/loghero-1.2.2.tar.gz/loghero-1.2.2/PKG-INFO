### Logging Actions

Use the `add_log` function to create a new log entry:

```python
from loghero.models import Severity, Status
from loghero import add_log, get_client_ip

ip = get_client_ip(request) # django http request optional
add_log(
    actor='John Doe',
    action='Login Attempt',
    severity=Severity.INFO,
    status=Status.SUCCESS,
    target='user@example.com',
    target_type='User',
    ip_address=ip, #optional
)
```
