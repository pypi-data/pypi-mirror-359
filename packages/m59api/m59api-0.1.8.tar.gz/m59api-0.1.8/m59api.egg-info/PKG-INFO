# Meridian 59 API (`m59api`)

This is a FastAPI-based API for managing a **Meridian 59** server.

---

## Installation

You can install `m59api` directly from PyPI:

```sh
pip install m59api
```

Official PyPI page: [https://pypi.org/project/m59api/](https://pypi.org/project/m59api/)

---

## Configuration

Before running the application, set the `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable if you want to use Discord webhook features.

**On Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell):**
```cmd
set DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-discord-webhook-url
```

**On macOS/Linux (bash/zsh):**
```bash
export DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-discord-webhook-url
```

---

## Running

**Quick start with all defaults:**
```
m59api
```
This will run the API on `127.0.0.1:8000` with log level `info`.

**Specify options (optional):**
```
m59api --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload --log-level debug
```

**Or with Uvicorn directly:**
```
uvicorn m59api.main:app --reload
```

**With Docker:**
```
docker run --rm -it -e DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-discord-webhook-url -p 5959:5959 -p 8000:8000 -p 9998:9998 m59-linux-test
```

---

## Configuration Options

- `--host`: Host to bind to (default: `127.0.0.1`)
- `--port`: Port to bind to (default: `8000`)
- `--reload`: Enable auto-reload for development (default: off)
- `--log-level`: Set log level (default: `info`)

You can combine these options as needed, or just run `m59api` for the defaults.

## Listening for Pushes from Meridian 59

In addition to querying the Meridian 59 server via the maintenance port, `m59api` can also listen for push messages sent from the server or other processes via a named pipe (on Windows) or a FIFO (on Linux).

- **On Linux:** Listens on `/tmp/m59apiwebhook` (FIFO)
- **On Windows:** Listens on `\\.\pipe\m59apiwebhook` (named pipe)

Any message written to this pipe will be received and printed by the API service. This allows the game server or other tools to push notifications or events to the API in real time.

> **Note:** On Windows, you must install `pywin32` for named pipe support:
> ```sh
> pip install pywin32
> ```

---

## How it Works

- **Querying:** Most API endpoints connect to the Meridian 59 maintenance port and issue commands to retrieve or modify server state.
- **Pushes:** The API also listens for messages sent to the OS pipe, allowing for real-time event pushes from the server or other processes.
