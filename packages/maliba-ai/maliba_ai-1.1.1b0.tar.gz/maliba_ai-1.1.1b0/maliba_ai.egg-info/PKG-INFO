---

## Quick Start

Get started with Bambara TTS in under a minute:

```python
from maliba_ai.tts.inference import BambaraTTSInference
from maliba_ai.config.settings import Speakers
import soundfile as sf

# Initialize the TTS system
tts = BambaraTTSInference()

# Generate speech from Bambara text
text = "Aw ni ce. Sedu bɛ aw fo wa aw ka yafa a ma, ka da a kan tuma dɔw la kow ka can."  

audio = tts.generate_speech(text, speaker_id=Speakers.Seydou)

# Save the audio
sf.write("greeting.wav", audio, 16000)
print("Bambara speech generated successfully!")
```

---

## Client Initialization

The TTS system initializes automatically with optimal settings:

```python
from maliba_ai.tts import BambaraTTSInference

# Standard initialization
tts = BambaraTTSInference()

# With custom model path and sequence length
tts = BambaraTTSInference(
    model_path="your-custom-model-path",  # Optional: custom model: local or huggingface repo id (make sure you login in huggingface)
    max_seq_length=4096                   # Optional: longer sequences
)
```

---

## Basic Usage

### Simple Text-to-Speech

The most straightforward way to generate Bambara speech:

```python
from maliba_ai.config.settings import Speakers

# Basic synthesis with default speaker (Adama)
text = "Bamanankan ye kan ɲuman ye"  
audio = tts.generate_speech(text)
```

### Speaker Selection

Choose from our ten authentic Bambara speakers:
```
Speaker recommendations:

  - Bourama: Most stable and accurate 
  - Adama: Natural conversational tone
  - Moussa: Clear pronunciation  
  - Modibo: Expressive delivery
  - Seydou: Balanced characteristics
  - Amadou: Warm and friendly voice
  - Bakary: Deep, authoritative tone
  - Ngolo: Youthful and energetic
  - Ibrahima: Calm and measured
  - Amara: Melodic and smooth
```

```python
from maliba_ai.config.settings import Speakers

text = "Aw ni ce. Ne tɔgɔ ye Adama. Awɔ,  ne ye maliden de ye. Aw Sanbɛ Sanbɛ. San min tɛ ɲinan ye, an bɛɛ ka jɛ ka o seli ɲɔgɔn fɛ,  hɛɛrɛ  ni lafiya la. Ala ka Mali suma. Ala ka Mali yiriwa. Ala ka Mali taa ɲɛ. Ala ka an ka seliw caya. Ala ka yafa an bɛɛ ma."

#let's try Adama
tts.generate_speech(
    text = text, 
    speaker_id = Speakers.Adama,
    output_filename = "adama.wav"
)



#let's try Seydou
tts.generate_speech(
    text = text, 
    speaker_id = Speakers.Seydou,
    output_filename = "seydou.wav"
)


# let's try Bourama
tts.generate_speech(
    text = text, 
    speaker_id = Speakers.Bourama,
    output_filename = "Bourama.wav"
)

```


**Note**: Try all speakers and chose your favorite for your use case

### Advanced Configuration

Fine-tune synthesis with custom parameters:

```python
audio = tts.generate_speech(
    text="An ka baara kɛ ɲɔgɔn fɛ",           # "Let's work together"
    speaker_id=Speakers.Bourama,
    temperature=0.8,                          # Sampling temperature
    top_k=50,                                # Vocabulary sampling
    top_p=0.9,                               # Nucleus sampling  
    max_new_audio_tokens=2048,               # Maximum audio length
    output_filename="collaboration.wav"       # Auto-save option
)
```

---


## Generation Parameters

The SDK comes with optimized default parameters that provide the best quality:

### Default Configuration
```python

temperature=0.8              # Optimal balance between consistency and naturalness
top_k=50                    # Vocabulary selection size
top_p=1.0                   # Nucleus sampling threshold (default)
max_new_audio_tokens=2048   # Maximum audio sequence length
```

### Parameter Guidelines
- **Temperature**: Keep at 0.8. Lower values (0.1-0.6) may sound robotic, higher values (1.0+) can introduce artifacts
- **Top-k**: Range 1-100. Default of 50 provides best quality
- **Top-p**: Range 0.1-1.0. Values like 0.9 can improve quality for some speakers
- **Max tokens**: Increase only for very long texts (splits recommended instead)

### Advanced Parameter Control
```python
# Conservative settings for maximum stability
audio = tts.generate_speech(
    "Ce!",  # "Hello!"
    speaker_id=Speakers.Bourama,
    temperature=0.6,              # More conservative
    top_k=30,                     # More focused vocabulary
    top_p=0.8,                    # Nucleus sampling
    max_new_audio_tokens=1024     # Shorter for efficiency
)

# Creative settings for experimental use
audio = tts.generate_speech(
    text,
    speaker_id=Speakers.Ngolo,
    temperature=1.0,              # More varied
    top_k=70,                     # Broader vocabulary
    top_p=0.95,                   # Slight nucleus sampling
    max_new_audio_tokens=2048
)
```

---

## Audio Output Options

Handle generated audio efficiently:

```python
import numpy as np

# Generate audio
audio = tts.generate_speech("Baara ka nɔgɔya", speaker_id=Speakers.Bourama)

# Method 1: Direct file saving during generation
audio = tts.generate_speech(
    "Baara ka nɔgɔya", 
    speaker_id=Speakers.Bourama,
    output_filename="work_improves.wav"
)


```

---

## Examples

### Educational Applications

Create learning materials with consistent, high-quality pronunciation:

```python
# Bambara language lessons with different speakers
lessons = [
    ("Walanda fɔlɔ: foli - I ni ce.", Speakers.Adama),             
    ("Walanda filanan : Tɔgɔ - N tɔgɔ ye Sedu", Speakers.Seydou),     
    ("Walanda sabanan: Jamu - I jamu ye mun ye?", Speakers.Bourama),  
    ("Walanda  naaninan: Baara - N bɛ baara kɛ", Speakers.Modibo),   
]

for i, (lesson, speaker) in enumerate(lessons, 1):
    audio = tts.generate_speech(
        lesson,
        speaker_id=speaker,
        output_filename=f"lesson_{i:02d}_{speaker.id.lower()}.wav"
    )
    print(f"Created lesson {i} with speaker {speaker.id}")
```

 **Test speakers**: Try different voices for your specific use case and audience
