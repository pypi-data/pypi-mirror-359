## Key Findings Relevant to Genocide Allegations (Gaza, Israel)

- Israel has faced sustained international criticism for its occupation of Palestinian territories, including accusations of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide against Palestinians (citing human rights orgs and UN officials).
- Multiple governments, a UN Special Committee, and various experts/human rights organizations have concluded that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians due to harm and loss of life inflicted on civilians during the Gaza War.
- The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in a 2024 advisory opinion stated that the occupation of Palestinian territories violated international law and that Israel should end its occupation as soon as possible and pay reparations; Israel was found in breach of Article 3 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (regarding racial segregation/apartheid).
- The article notes widespread international consensus that Israeli settlements in occupied territories are illegal under international law, referencing UN Security Council Resolution 2334 and findings by UN special rapporteurs and Amnesty International.
- The article outlines significant civilian casualties and destruction in Gaza from Israeli military operations, with some sources describing these as one of the most destructive bombing campaigns in modern history.
- The status of Gaza (and Israel’s actions therein) remains highly contested, with the UN and other bodies largely considering it "occupied," despite Israeli withdrawal of troops and settlers in 2005.
- The article references the ICJ’s ongoing genocide case brought by South Africa against Israel, as well as the broader context of international investigations and debates about whether legal criteria for genocide are met.
