Date: Ongoing (2023–2025)
Source type: Official court documentation
Credibility: Authoritative, primary source for international law

Key findings:
- South Africa filed a case at the ICJ accusing Israel of violating the Genocide Convention in Gaza (Dec 2023).
- The ICJ issued several provisional measures (Jan–May 2024) requiring Israel to prevent genocidal acts, ensure humanitarian aid, preserve evidence of alleged crimes, and report on compliance.
- Multiple states (e.g., Spain, Ireland, Chile, Mexico) and Palestine intervened in support of the case through formal declarations.
- The ICJ has NOT yet ruled on the merits; current orders are provisional, not a final determination of genocide.
- Proceedings continue, with written and oral hearings, document submissions, and regular orders for updated measures.
- The ICJ’s orders are binding but focus on preventing irreparable harm while the case is adjudicated.
