# Contributing to mcstools

So you're interested in contributing to this package? Great!
And thanks for being a part of the Cloudspotting on Mars project!
My guess is you've found your way here from the Cloudspotting on Mars Zooniverse page, and you're looking for a way to go beyond the primary task.

At the moment, the main purpose of this repository is to let you interact with the data used to create the images on Zooniverse more directly.
Here are some ways you can help:
- First, try [following these steps](README.md) to download the repository and try visualizing some data.
- Play around with the data viewer and see what works and what makes sense. 
- If something is confusing, try starting a [Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/Cloudspotting-on-Mars/discussions)
- If something doesn't work or seems incorrect, feel free to start an [Issue](https://github.com/Cloudspotting-on-Mars/mcstools/issues). Get more information on best practices here: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart.
- If you know python, take a look at any open issues, [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo), and [submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). We appreciate the help!
- Maybe coding isn't your forte, but you've found the visualization tool useful for your cloudspotting. Consider making a tutorial showing how to use it and sending it to us so we can share it with others. Or consider writing a [blog post](https://cloudspotting-on-mars.github.io) on your experience with the Cloudspotting on Mars project!
