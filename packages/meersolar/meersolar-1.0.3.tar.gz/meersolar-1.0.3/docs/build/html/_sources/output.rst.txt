Directory Structure and Data Products
=====================================
Once user started a MeerSOLAR pipeline job, MeerSOLAR assign a unique JobID based on current time in millisecond precision in YYYYMMDDHHMMSSmmm format.
Note down the Job ID to view the logger.

The following output will appear in terminal:

.. code-block :: console

    ########################################
    Starting MeerSOLAR Pipeline....
    #########################################

    ###########################
    MeerSOLAR Job ID: <YYYYMMDDHHMMSSmmm>
    Work directory: <workdir>
    Final product directory: <outputdir>
    ###########################

Directory structure
-------------------

All data intermediate data products will be saved in ``<workdir>``.

All final data products will be saved in ``<outputdir>``.

.. note :: 

   In local workstations, it is okay to choose ``<workdir>`` and ``<outputdir>``. In HPC environment, generally, high-speed disks are used during data-processing, which may have limited storage life-time, and has seperate long-term storage disks. It is recommended to choose ``<workdir>`` path inside the high-speed disk and ``<outputdir>`` inside the long-term storage disk. Otherwise, there may be possiblity that final data-products will be removed after certain time.

Data products
-------------
Pipeline produces calibrated visibilities as well as several imaging products.

Dynamic spectrum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dynamic spectra for all (or the ones selected) target scans are available in ``dynamic_spectra`` directory inside the output directory ``<outputdir>``.

Calibrated visibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Calibrated measurements sets for all (or the ones selected) target scans will be available in work directory ``<workdir>`` with naming format, ``targets_scan_<scan_number>_spw_<channel_range>.ms``. Calibrated measurement sets will not be saved in output directory ``<outputdir>`` (unless same as ``<workdir>``) to save space.

Imaging products 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Imaging products are available in ``imagedir_f_<freqres>_t_<timeres>_w_<weight>_<robust>`` directory inside output directory ``<outputdir>``. If imaging is performed with different time and frequency resolutions or different weighting schemes, seperate image directories with corresponding parameters will have the corresponding images. 

1. **Image fits in RA/DEC** - Fits images in RA/DEC coordinate are available in ``imagedir_f_<freqres>_t_<timeres>_w_<weight>_<robust>/images`` directory inside work directory. These are not primary beam corrected.

    .. note ::
        
       All fits images have some MeerSOLAR specific metadata in the header and some image statistics.

2. **Primary beam corrected image fits** - Primary beam corrected fits images are available in ``imagedir_f_<freqres>_t_<timeres>_w_<weight>_<robust>/pbcor_images`` directory inside work directory.

3. **Brightness temperature image fits** - Brightness temperature fits images are available in ``imagedir_f_<freqres>_t_<timeres>_w_<weight>_<robust>/tb_images`` directory inside work directory. 

4. **CLEAN model and residual fits** - CLEAN model and residual images are available in ``imagedir_f_<freqres>_t_<timeres>_w_<weight>_<robust>/models`` and ``imagedir_f_<freqres>_t_<timeres>_w_<weight>_<robust>/residuals`` directory inside work directory. These are not saved only if ``keep_backup`` option is switched on.

5. **Radio images in helioprojective coordinates** - Directory names ``hpcs`` inside directories like, ``images, pbcor_images, tb_images`` inside the image directory will have the FITS images in helioprojective coordinates. Images in PNG and PDF formats are also available in ``pngs`` and ``pdfs`` directories inside the parent directories.

    .. note ::
      
       Header of helioprojective maps have wavelength information in unit of ``centimeter`` or ``meter``.  

6. **Overlays on GOES-SUVI EUV images** - Overlays on GOES SUVI EUV (193 Ã…) images are saved in PNG and PDF formats in ``imagedir_f_<freqres>_t_<timeres>_w_<weight>_<robust>/overlays_pngs`` and ``imagedir_f_<freqres>_t_<timeres>_w_<weight>_<robust>/overlays_pngs``, respectively.
