Initial Setup
=============

After installation of **MeerSOLAR**, before running the pipeline, some initial setup is needed. These include downloading some required metadata for the pipeline and setup of remote logger.


Download MeerSOLAR metadata
---------------------------
1. To download and save the required MeerSOLAR metadata in appropriate directory, run from command line:

.. code-block :: bash
    
    init_meersolar_data --init
    
2. If data files are present, but needs to updated, run:

.. code-block :: bash

    init_meersolar_data --init --update
    
Setup e-mail ids
----------------
To receive remote logger Job ID and password, use can setup their e-mail id(s) in MeerSOLAR. 

.. code-block :: bash

    init_meersolar_data --init --emails <youremail1@email1.id1>,<youremail2@email2.id2> 
    
If you setup a remote logger as described below, you will receive a Job ID and auto-generated six-character password to access logs of a particular pipeline run from the remote logger. Without this password, one can not access logs of that particular pipeline run. This added security as well as privacy when multiple user uses the same remote logger link, for example, an institute based remote logger link.   
    
Setup remote logger link
-------------------------
If remote logger is intended to be used, setup the remote link in MeerSOLAR metadata.

.. code-block :: bash
    
    init_meersolar_data --init --remotelink https://<remote-logger-name>.onrender.com
    
Before doing this, create your own remote logger on free-tier cloud platform, https://render.com. One can use, same **remotelink** in multiple machines and users. However, free-tier link has some limitations on bandwidth. If you want to use **remotelink** for your institution, we suggest to purchase suitable paid version or setup seperate **remotelink** for different users.

Update remote logger link and/or e-mail ids
-------------------------------------------
If user wants to update the already provided remote logger link or e-mail id(s), simply run the above commands with new values. MeerSOLAR will automatically update the database with these new values.
