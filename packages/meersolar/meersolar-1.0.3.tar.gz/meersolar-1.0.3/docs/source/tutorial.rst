Tutorial
========
This tutorial provides users a basic understanding how to run MeerSOLAR. Although basic, this serves most of the purpose, even at advanced levels. 

Seperate command line interfaces (CLI) are only needed for users who want to test seperate part of the pipeline or develop their own pipeline for MeerKAT data analysis for non-solar observations, for example standard astronomical observations.
