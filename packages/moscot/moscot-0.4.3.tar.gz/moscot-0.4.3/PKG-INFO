**moscot** is a framework for Optimal Transport (OT) applications in
single-cell genomics. It scales to large datasets and can be used for a
variety of applications across different modalities.

moscot's key applications
---------------------------
- Trajectory inference (incorporating spatial and lineage information).
- Mapping cells to their spatial organisation.
- Aligning spatial transcriptomics slides.
- Translating modalities.
- prototyping of new OT models in single-cell genomics.
- ... and more, check out the `documentation <https://moscot.readthedocs.io>`_ for more information.


**moscot** is powered by
`OTT <https://ott-jax.readthedocs.io>`_ which is a JAX-based Optimal
Transport toolkit that supports just-in-time compilation, GPU acceleration, automatic
differentiation and linear memory complexity for OT problems.

Installation
------------
Install **moscot** by running::

    pip install moscot

In order to install **moscot** from in editable mode, run::

    git clone https://github.com/theislab/moscot
    cd moscot
    pip install -e .

For further instructions how to install jax, please refer to https://github.com/google/jax.

Citing moscot
-------------
If you find a model useful for your research, please consider citing the `Klein et al., 2025`_ manuscript as
well as the publication introducing the model, which can be found in the corresponding documentation.
