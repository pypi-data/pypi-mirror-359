## Dataset
The test prompt dataset used in the paper can be found in `mover_dataset`


## Setup

### MoVer
1. Set up a virtual environment with your favorite tool. It is recommended to use `uv` because it is very fast.
2. Make sure you have the right version of `pytorch` installed for your system.
3. Install MoVer with `pip` (works without "uv" in front of "pip")
```bash
uv pip install git+https://github.com/vacancy/Jacinle.git && \
uv pip install git+https://github.com/jama1017/Concepts.git@main && \
uv pip install mover
```

or, to install MoVer for development, clone this repository and run
```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt && \
uv pip install -e .
```

4. Store your API keys as environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`).
    - MoVer includes APIs to interface with OpenAI, Gemini (via OpenAI), and Groq by default.

5. (Optional) If you plan to run locally-hosted models, install the following dependencies:
    - Install `ollama` if you plan to use ollama with `ollama-python`
    - Install `vLLM` if you plan to use vLLM

6. (Optional) We support rendering to video with OpenCV, but the video produced might have limited compatibility. If you optionally install `ffmpeg`, our converter will automatically use it to convert rendered videos.


## Usage
Check out the `tutorial.ipynb` for a tutorial of the motion graphics animation generation with MoVer verification pipeline.
