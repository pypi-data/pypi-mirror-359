Overview
========

Welcome to multiHIVE's documentation!
-------------------------------------

**multiHIVE** multiHIVE, a hierarchical multimodal deep generative model for inferring cellular embeddings by integrating CITE-seq data modalities. multiHIVE employs hierarchically stacked latent variables as well as modality-specific latent variables to capture shared and private information from the modalities respectively, facilitating integration, denoising and protein imputation and integration of CITE-seq dataset with unimodal dataset. The factorization of multiHIVE-inferred denoised expression into gene expression programs aids in identifying biological processes at multiple levels of cellular hierarchy.
