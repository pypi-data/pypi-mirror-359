Installation
============

We recommend users to directly clone our stable main branch and set multiHIVE as the working directory 
and install the following dependencies in a new conda environment `python>=3.11`::

    git clone https://github.com/Zafar-Lab/multiHIVE.git
    pip install scvi-tools==1.3.0
    pip install scanpy==1.11.0
    pip install scikit-misc

Or install directly via pip
---------------------------

    pip install multiHIVE
