## Difficulty Assessment

### Extraction Type
**Primary Goal:** Table Extraction

### Potential Challenges
- No obvious structural challenges identified from user description

### OCR Requirements  
**Needs OCR:** No (text-based PDF)

### Recommended Approach
**Primary Method - Standard Table Extraction:**
```python
import natural_pdf as npdf

# Load and extract table
pdf = npdf.PDF("document.pdf")
page = pdf.pages[0]
table_data = page.extract_table()

# Convert to pandas DataFrame for analysis
import pandas as pd
if table_data:
    df = pd.DataFrame(table_data[1:], columns=table_data[0])  # Skip header row
    print(df.head())
```

**Alternative Method - TATR for Complex Tables:**
```python
# For complex table structures, use TATR layout analysis
page.analyze_layout('tatr')
table_regions = page.find_all('region[type="table"]')

for table_region in table_regions:
    # Get detailed table structure
    table_structure = table_region.find_table_structure()
    print(f"Table: {table_structure['rows']}Ã—{table_structure['columns']}")
```
