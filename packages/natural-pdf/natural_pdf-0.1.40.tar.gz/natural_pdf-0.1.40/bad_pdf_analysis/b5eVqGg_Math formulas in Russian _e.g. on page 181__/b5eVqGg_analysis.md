## Difficulty Assessment

### Extraction Type
**Primary Goal:** Form Extraction

### Potential Challenges
- No obvious structural challenges identified from user description

### OCR Requirements  
**Needs OCR:** No (text-based PDF)

### Recommended Approach
**Primary Method - Field-based Extraction:**
```python
import natural_pdf as npdf

pdf = npdf.PDF("document.pdf")
page = pdf.pages[0]

# Find form fields by labels
fields = {}
labels = page.find_all('text:contains("Name:")').add(
    page.find_all('text:contains("Date:")').add(
    page.find_all('text:contains("Amount:")')))

for label in labels:
    # Get value to the right of the label
    value = label.right(until='text').extract_text()
    fields[label.text] = value

print(fields)
```

**Alternative Method - Structured Data Extraction:**
```python
# Use AI-powered structured extraction
from pydantic import BaseModel

class FormData(BaseModel):
    name: str
    date: str
    amount: float

extracted_data = page.extract_structured_data(FormData)
print(extracted_data)
```
