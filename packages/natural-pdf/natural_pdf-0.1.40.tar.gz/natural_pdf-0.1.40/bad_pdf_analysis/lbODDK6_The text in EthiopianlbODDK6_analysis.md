## Difficulty Assessment

### Extraction Type
**Primary Goal:** Text Extraction

### Potential Challenges
- **Multi-column Layout**: Multiple columns may require special handling for proper text flow

### OCR Requirements  
**Needs OCR:** No (text-based PDF)

### Recommended Approach
**Primary Method - Spatial Text Extraction:**
```python
import natural_pdf as npdf

pdf = npdf.PDF("document.pdf")
page = pdf.pages[0]

# Extract all text with spatial awareness
text_content = page.extract_text()

# Or find specific text patterns
target_elements = page.find_all('text:contains("keyword")')
for element in target_elements:
    print(f"Found: {element.text} at position {element.bbox}")
```

**Alternative Method - Structured Text with Layout Analysis:**
```python
# Use layout analysis to understand document structure
page.analyze_layout()
text_regions = page.find_all('region[type="text"]')

for region in text_regions:
    text = region.extract_text()
    print(f"Text region: {text[:100]}...")
```
