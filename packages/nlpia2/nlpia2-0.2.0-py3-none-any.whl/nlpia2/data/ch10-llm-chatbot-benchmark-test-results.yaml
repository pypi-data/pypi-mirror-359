  prompt: "Suzi has 5 wingeroos. Her girlfriend gives her fiv packets of wingeroos but then takes four back. There are three to a pack. How many wingeroos does she have after all this?"
  Perplexity AI:
    A: "I'm sorry, I couldn't find any relevant search results for the given question. However, based on the information provided, we can calculate the number of wingeroos Suzi has after the exchange. Suzi starts with 5 wingeroos. Her girlfriend gives her 5 packets of wingeroos, which would be a total of 15 wingeroos (assuming each packet has 3 wingeroos). However, her girlfriend takes 4 packets back, which would be a total of 12 wingeroos. Therefore, after the exchange, Suzi would have 5 + 12 = 17 wingeroos."

    A: "Suzi initially had 5 wingeroos. Her girlfriend gave her 5 packets of wingeroos, which would be a total of 5 x 3 = 15 wingeroos.\nHowever, her girlfriend took back 4 packets, which would be a total of 4 x 3 = 12 wingeroos.\nTherefore, Suzi would be left with 15 - 12 = 3 wingeroos after all this."

      A: "Suzi has 5 pickleballs and she buys 2 packs of tennis balls, each containing 3 balls. So, she has 2 x 3 = 6 tennis balls.\nTherefore, Suzi has a total of 5 + 6 = 11 balls now."
      note: "contradictory logic 'she has 2 x 3 = 6 tennis balls' vs 'Suzi has a total of 5 + 6 = 11 balls now'"

      correct: False
