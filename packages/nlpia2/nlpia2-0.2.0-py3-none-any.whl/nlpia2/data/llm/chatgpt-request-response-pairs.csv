The intern lives in Oregon, what is the minimum wage for this 14 year old.","As of July 2021, the minimum wage in Oregon is $12.75 per hour. However, there are some restrictions on hiring minors for work. In Oregon, 14 and 15-year-olds are only allowed to work outside of school hours, and there are limits on the number of hours they can work per day and per week. Additionally, there are certain types of work that are prohibited for minors. It is important to consult with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries to ensure that you are in compliance with all applicable labor laws and regulations.",2023-06-02T15:21:19.464610

For 14- and 15-year-olds, during the school year, they can work a maximum of 18 hours per week, with no more than 3 hours on a school day and 8 hours on a non-school day. During the summer, they can work a maximum of 40 hours per week, with no more than 8 hours per day.

For 16- and 17-year-olds, during the school year, they can work a maximum of 28 hours per week, with no more than 4 hours on a school day and 8 hours on a non-school day. During the summer, they can work a maximum of 48 hours per week, with no more than 8 hours per day.

It's important to note that these are the maximum hours allowed by law, and employers may choose to set lower limits.",2023-06-02T15:26:11.535268

Intelligent Deep Learning researcher at Open AI or Google Deep Mind,What is the reinforcement learning objective function for the ChatGPT architecture?,"The ChatGPT architecture is a language model based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture, which is typically trained using unsupervised learning. Therefore, there is no explicit reinforcement learning objective function for ChatGPT.

However, it is possible to fine-tune the ChatGPT model using reinforcement learning to improve its performance on specific tasks, such as dialogue generation. In this case, the reinforcement learning objective function would depend on the specific task and the reward signal used to guide the model's behavior. For example, in a dialogue generation task, the objective function could be based on maximizing the quality of the generated responses while minimizing the repetition and irrelevance of the generated text. The reward signal could be based on human feedback or a pre-defined evaluation metric.",2023-06-17T14:27:01.359071
Intelligent Deep Learning researcher at Open AI or Google Deep Mind,How is the reward signal computed for the RLHF (reinforcement learning) used to continuously update ChatGPT's model weights and responses?,"The reward signal in RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) is computed based on the feedback provided by human evaluators. In the case of ChatGPT, the reward signal is computed based on how well the model's responses match the expectations of the human evaluators.

The process works as follows: 

1. The ChatGPT model generates a response to a given input.

2. The response is then presented to a human evaluator who rates the response on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how well it matches their expectations.

3. The rating provided by the human evaluator is used as the reward signal for the RLHF algorithm.

4. The RLHF algorithm then uses this reward signal to update the model's weights and improve its responses.

5. This process is repeated iteratively, with the model generating new responses, human evaluators providing feedback, and the RLHF algorithm updating the model's weights based on the feedback received.

Overall, the RLHF algorithm uses human feedback to guide the model's learning process, allowing it to continuously improve its responses over time.",2023-06-17T14:29:28.652658
