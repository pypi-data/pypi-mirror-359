I'm trying to learn English what should I do?

Here are some suggestions for learning English:

    Immerse yourself in the language as much as possible by watching English-language TV shows, movies, and videos, listening to English-language music, and reading English-language books, newspapers, and magazines.

    Practice speaking and listening as much as possible. Try to find a language exchange partner or conversation partner who speaks English.

    Study grammar and vocabulary regularly. Try using flashcards or a vocabulary app to help memorize new words and phrases.

    Take an English course. Online or in-person classes can provide structure and feedback to help improve your language skills.

    Be patient and persistent. Learning a new language takes time and effort, but with consistent practice and dedication, you can make progress.

Can you explain the following sentence to me: "People can't talk to Abdul -- he is too stubborn to talk to."

Certainly! The sentence means that people are unable to communicate with Abdul because he is very stubborn and unwilling to talk or listen to them. Stubbornness refers to a personality trait where a person is resistant to change their thoughts, beliefs or opinions, and may be difficult to persuade or convince. In this case, Abdul is so set in his ways that he refuses to engage in conversation with others, making it difficult for them to communicate with him.

The phrase "impossible to talk to" suggests a level of frustration or disappointment with the individual's communication style or behavior.

What does this mean: "Osama is too stubborn to talk to."

The sentence "Osama is too stubborn to talk to" means that Osama is a person who is very resistant to changing their opinions, ideas or behaviors, and this makes it difficult to have a conversation or communicate effectively with him.

dad grounded me for staying out too late with my boyfriend

It can be difficult when parents impose rules and consequences that we don't agree with. However, it's important to remember that your parents care about you and want to keep you safe. Try to understand where they're coming from and communicate with them calmly and respectfully. It might be helpful to explain your perspective and ask if there's a compromise that can be reached. If the punishment is grounded, try to stay positive, use your time to focus on your hobbies, studies or do things you enjoy. Also, try to use this time to reflect on your actions and consider how you can make better choices in the future. Remember that you can always talk to a counselor or trusted adult if you need someone to talk to.
