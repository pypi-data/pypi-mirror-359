= Getting real (real-world NLP challenges)
:chapter: FM
:part: 3

Part 3 shows you how to extend your skills to tackle real-world problems. 
You'll learn how to extract information such as dates and names to build applications such as the Twitter bot that helped manage the self-service scheduling of Open Spaces at PyCon US in 2017 and 2018. 

In these last three chapters, we also tackle the trickier problems of NLP. 
You'll learn about several different ways to build a chatbot, both with and without machine learning to guide it. 
And to create complex behavior, you'll learn how to combine these techniques together. 
You'll also learn about algorithms that can handle large corpora -- sets of documents that cannot be loaded into RAM all at once.
