We've collected some definitions of common natural language processing and machine language acronyms and terminology here.footnote:[Bill Wilson at the university of New South Wales in Australia has a more complete NLP glossary (www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~billw/nlpdict.html)]

You can find some of the parsers and regular expressions we used to help generate this list in the `nlpia` Python package at gitlab.com/tangibleai/nlpia2 (https://gitlab.com/tangibleai/nlpia2). footnote:[`nlpia.translators` (https://gitlab.com/tangibleai/nlpia2/blob/master/src/nlpia/translators.py) and `nlpia.book_parser` (https://gitlab.com/tangibleai/nlpia2/blob/master/src/nlpia/book_parser.py)]:

We didn't quite complete the definition part of this processor, but that might be possible with a good LSTM language model (see chapter 10). We leave that to you.

*FSM*:: Finite state machine -- Kyle Gorman and Wikipedia can explain this better than I (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine).
*FST*:: Finite state transducer -- Like regular expressions, but they can output a new character to replace each character they matched. Kyle Gorman explains them well (www.openfst.org).

Conversational LLMs such as InstructGPT use reinforcement learning augmented with human curators in order to keep up with the evolution of language and concepts. The human labelers are identifying whether generated text is within the ethical and quality guidelines for the model. But unlike conventional RL, these labels are used to train a quality scoring supervisor model that is then used to flag future bot responses for labeling.
*HNSW*:: "Efficient and robust approximate  nearest  neighbor  search using Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs" (https://arxiv.org/vc/arxiv/papers/1603/1603.09320v1.pdf) by Yu. A. Malkov, D. A. Yashunin -- A graph data structure that enables efficient search.

*LSH*:: Locality sensitive hash_ -- A hash that works as an efficient but approximate mapping/clustering index on dense, continuous, high-dimensional vectors (see chapter 13). Think of them as zip codes that work for more than just 2D (latitude and longitude).
*LSI*:: Latent semantic indexing -- An old-school way of describing latent semantic analysis (see LSA), but it's a misnomer, since LSA vector-space models do not lend themselves to being easily indexed.
*LSTM*:: Long short-term memory -- An enhanced form of a recurrent neural network that maintains a memory of state that itself is trained via backpropagation (see chapter 9)
*MIH*:: Multi index hashing -- A hashing and indexing approach for high-dimensional dense vectors.

*PCA*:: Principal component analysis_ -- Truncated SVD on any numerical data, typically images or audio files.
*QDA*:: Quadratic discriminant analysis -- Similar to LDA, but allows for quadratic (curved) boundaries between classes.
*ReLU*:: Rectified linear unit -- A linear neural net activation function that forces the output of a neuron to be nonzero. Equivalent to `y = np.max(x, 0)`. The most popular and efficient activation function for image processing and NLP because it allows back propagation to work efficiently on extremely deep networks without "vanishing the gradients".
*REPL*:: Read–evaluate–print loop -- The typical workflow of a developer of any scripting language that doesn't need to be compiled. The `ipython`, `jupyter console`, and `jupyter notebook` REPLs are particularly powerful, with their `help`, `?`, `??`, and `%` magic commands, plus auto-complete, and Ctrl-R history search.footnote:[Python's REPLs even allow you to execute any shell command (including `pip`) installed on your OS (such as `!git commit -am 'fix 123'`). This lets your fingers stay on the keyboard and away from the mouse, minimizing cognitive load from context switches.]

[terms]
== Terms

[terms,template="glossary",id="terms"]
**affordance*:: A way for your user to interact with your product or product that you intentionally make possible. Ideally that interaction should come naturally to the user, be easily discoverable, and self-documenting.
*Artificial neural network*:: A computational graph for machine learning or simulation of a biological neural network (brain)
*Cell*:: The memory or "state" part of an LSTM unit that records a single scalar value and outputs it continuously footnote:[See the web page titled "Long short-term memory - Wikipedia" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory).]
*Dark patterns*:: Software patterns (usually for a user interface) that are intended to increase revenue but often fail due to "blowback" because they manipulate your customers into using your product in ways that they do not intend.
*Feed-forward network*:: A "one-way" neural network that passes all its inputs through to its outputs in a consistent direction forming a computation directed acyclic graph (DAG) or tree
*Morpheme*:: A part of a token or word that contains meaning in and of itself. The morphemes that make up a token are collectively called the token's _morphology_. The morphology of a token can be found using algorithms in packages like SpaCy that process the token with its context (words around it).footnote:[See the web page titled "Linguistic Features : spaCy Usage Documentation" (https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#rule-based-morphology).]
*Net, network, or neural net*:: Artificial neural network
*Neuron*:: A unit in a neural net whose function (such as `y = tanh(w.dot(x))`) takes multiple inputs and output a single scalar value. This value is usually the weights for that neuron (**w** or _w_~i~) multiplied by all the input signals (**x** or _x_~i~) and summed with a bias weight (_w_~0~) before applying an activation function like _tanh_. A neuron always outputs a scalar value, which is sent to the inputs of any additional hidden or output neurons in the network. If a neuron implements a much more complicated activation function than that, like the enhancements that were made to recurrent neurons to create an LSTM, it is usually called a _unit_, for example, an _LSTM unit_.
*Nessvector*:: An informal term for topic vectors or semantic vectors that capture concepts or qualities, such as femaleness or blueness into the dimensions of a vector,
*Predicate*:: In English grammar, the predicate is the main verb of a sentence that is associated with the subject. Every complete sentence must have a predicate, just like it must also have a subject.
*Skip-grams*:: Pairs of tokens used as training examples for a word vector embedding, where any number of intervening words are ignored (see chapter 6)
*Softmax*:: Normalized exponential function used to squash the real-valued vector output by a neural network so that its values range between 0 and 1 like probabilities: latexmath:[\sigma(z)_j = \frac{e^{z_j}}{\sum_{k=1}^{K}{e^{z_k}}}]
*Subject*:: The main noun of a sentence -- every complete sentence must have a subject (and a predicate) even if the subject is implied, like in the sentence "Run!", where the implied subject is "you".
*Unit*:: Neuron or small collection of neurons that perform some more complicated nonlinear function to compute the output. For example an LSTM unit has a memory cell that records state, an input gate (neuron) that decides what value to remember, a forget gate (neuron) that decides how long to remember that value, and an output gate neuron that accomplishes the activation function of the unit (usually a sigmoid or _tanh()_). A unit is a drop-in replacement for a neuron in a neural net that takes a vector input and outputs a scalar value; it just has more complicated behavior.
