In writing this book we pulled from numerous resources.
Here are some of our favorites.

In an ideal world, you could find these resources yourself simply by entering the heading text into a semantic search engine like Duck Duck Go (http://duckduckgo.com), Gigablast (http://gigablast.com/search?c=main&q=open+source+search+engine), or Qwant (https://www.qwant.com/web).
But until Jimmy Wales takes another shot at Wikia Search (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikia_Search) or Google shares their NLP technology, we have to rely on 1990s-style lists of links like this.
Check out the <<search_engines_section>> section if your contribution to saving the world includes helping open source projects that index the web.

## Applications and project ideas

Here are some applications to inspire your own NLP projects.

* Retrain or specialize a sentence encoder (embedding model) on a variety of tasks including those used for the Universal Sentence Encoder (https://medium.com/huggingface/universal-word-sentence-embeddings-ce48ddc8fc3a).
* Compute an "information content" or complexity score for an NLP corpus by finding the minimum LSTM memory vector (embedding) dimensionality (number of encoder output neurons) required to perform a translation or autoencoder or word prediction task and near-state-of the art accuracye. Use the InferSent (https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02364) paper and code (https://github.com/facebookresearch/InferSent) to evaluate performance on the same set of tasks that Facebook uses to evaluate their language models (embedders).
* Guessing passwords from social network profiles (http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/artificial-intelligence-just-made-guessing-your-password-whole-lot-easier)
* Predict censorship trends: Perform NLP/NLU of historical archive of twitter feeds and other news articles to generate a timeseries of NLU embedding vectors and other NLP features to predict censorship topic, geographic region, keywords and activity magnitude. These target variables can be obtained from raw Censored Planet logs (http://censoredplanet.org/data/rawand) using their visualizations (http://censoredplanet.org/data/visualizations) to reproduce their censorship metrics for historical time periods.
* "Chatbot lawyer overturns 160,000 parking tickets in London and New York" (www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/28/chatbot-ai-lawyer-donotpay-parking-tickets-london-new-york)
* "GitHub - craigboman/gutenberg: Librarian working with project gutenberg data, for NLP and machine learning purposes." (https://github.com/craigboman/gutenberg)
* _Longitudial Detection of Dementia Through Lexical and Syntactic Changes in Writing_ (ftp://ftp.cs.toronto.edu/dist/gh/Le-MSc-2010.pdf) -- Masters thesis by Xian Le on psychology diagnosis with NLP
* Time Series Matching (https://www.cs.nyu.edu/web/Research/Theses/wang_zhihua.pdf) -- Songs, audio clips, and other time series can be discretized and searched with dynamic programming algorithms analogous to Levenshtein distance.
* NELL, Never Ending Language Learning (http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/rtw/publications) -- CMU's constantly evolving knowledge base that learns by scraping natural language text
* How the NSA identified Satoshi Nakamoto (https://medium.com/cryptomuse/how-the-nsa-caught-satoshi-nakamoto-868affcef595) -- Wired Magazine and the NSA identified Satoshi Nakamoto using NLP, or "stylometry".
* Stylometry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylometry) and Natural Language Forensics (http://www.parkjonghyuk.net/lecture/2017-2nd-lecture/forensic/s8.pdf) -- Style/pattern matching and clustering of natural language text (also music and artwork) for authorship and attribution
* Online dictionaries like Your Dictionary (http://examples.yourdictionary.com/) can be scraped for grammatically correct sentences with POS labels which can be used to train your own Parsey McParseface (https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/05/announcing-syntaxnet-worlds-most.html) syntax tree and POS tagger.
* "Identifying 'Fake News' with NLP" (https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/identifying-fake-news-nlp/) by Julia Goldstein and Mike Ghoul at NYC Data Science Academy.
* A simpleNumericalFactChecker (https://github.com/uclmr/simpleNumericalFactChecker) by Andreas Vlachos (https://github.com/andreasvlachos) and information extraction (see chapter 11) could be used to rank publishers, authors, and reporters for truthfulness. Might be combined with Julia Goldstein's "fake news" predictor.
* The artificial-adversary (https://github.com/airbnb/artificial-adversary) package by Jack Dai, an intern at Airbnb -- Obfuscates natural language text (turning phrases lke 'you are great' into 'ur gr8'). You could train a machine learning classifier to detect and "translate" English into obfuscated English or L33T (https://sites.google.com/site/inhainternetlanguage/different-internet-languages/l33t). You could also train a stemmer (an autoencoder with the obfuscator generating character features) to decipher obfuscated words so your NLP pipeline can handle obfuscated text without retraining. Thank you Aleck.

== Research papers and talks

One of the best way to gain a deep understanding of a topic is to try to repeat the experiments of researchers and then modify them in some way.
That's how the best professors and mentors "teach" their students, by just encouraging them to try to duplicate the results of other researchers they are interested in.
You can't help but tweak an approach if you spend enough time trying to get it to work for you.

### Vector space models and semantic search

### LSTMs and RNNs

We had a lot of difficulty understanding the terminology and architecture of LSTMs. This is a gathering of the most cited references so you can let the authors "vote" on the right way to talk about LSTMs. The state of the Wikipedia page (and Talk page discussion) on LSTMs is a pretty good indication of the lack of consensus about what LSTM means.

* "Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078.pdf) by Cho, Bengio, et al -- Explains how the contents of the memory cells in an LSTM layer can be used as an embedding that can encode variable length sequences and then decode them to a new variable length sequence with a potentially different length, translating or transcoding on sequence into another

* "Open Knowledge Extraction Challenge" (https://svn.aksw.org/papers/2017/ESWC_Challenge_OKE/public.pdf)

## Datasets

## Search engines

Search (information retrieval) is a big part of NLP.
And it's extremely important that we get it right so that our AI (and corporate) overlords can't manipulate us through the information they feed our brains.
If you want to learn how to retrieve your own information, build your own search engines, these are some resources that will help.

### Search algorithms

* "GPU-enhanced BidMACH" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.08734.pdf) -- BidMACH is a high-dimensional vector indexing and KNN search implementation, similar to the `annoy` python package. This paper explains an enhancement for GPUs that is 8x faster than the original implementation.
* Spotify's `Annoy` Package (https://erikbern.com/2017/11/26/annoy-1.10-released-with-hamming-distance-and-windows-support.html) by Erik Bernhardsson's -- A K nearest neighbors algorithm used at Spotify to find "similar" songs.
* "Erik Bernhardsson's ANN Comparison" (https://erikbern.com/2018/02/15/new-benchmarks-for-approximate-nearest-neighbors.html) -- Approximate nearest neighbor algorithms are the key to scalable semantic search, and Erik keeps tabs on the state of the art.

### Open source search engines

* "BeeSeek" (https://launchpad.net/~beeseek-devs) -- Open source distributed web indexing and private search (hive search); no longer maintained
* "WebSphinx" (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rcm/websphinx/) -- Web GUI for building a web crawler

### Open source full-text indexers

Efficient indexing is critical to any natural language search application.
Here are a few open source full-text indexing options.
However, these "search engines" do not crawl the web, so you need to provide them with the corpus you want them to index and search.

* "Elastic Search" (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) -- "Open Source, Distributed, RESTful Search Engine".
* "Apache Lucern + Solr" (https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr)
* "Sphinx Search" (https://github.com/sphinxsearch/sphinx)
* "Kronuz/Xapiand: Xapiand: A RESTful Search Engine" (https://github.com/Kronuz/Xapiand) -- There are packages for Ubuntu that will let you search your local hard drive (like Google Desktop used to do).
* "Lemur Project Components: Indri" (http://www.lemurproject.org/indri.php) -- Semantic search with a Python interface (https://github.com/cvangysel/pyndri) but it isn't actively maintained.
* "Gigablast" (https://github.com/gigablast/open-source-search-engine) -- Open source web crawler and natural language indexer in C++.
* "Zettair" (http://www.seg.rmit.edu.au/zettair) -- Open source HTML and TREC indexer (no crawler or live example); last updated 2009.
* "OpenFTS: Open Source Full Text Search Engine" (http://openfts.sourceforge.net) -- Full text search indexer for PyFTS using PostgreSQL with a Python API (http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/projects/pyfts.html).

### Manipulative search engines

The search engines most of us use are not optimized solely to help you find what you need, but rather to ensure that you click  links that generate revenue for the company that built it.
Google's innovative second-price sealed-bid auction ensures that advertisers don't overpay for their ads,footnote:[Cornell University Networks Course case study, "Google Adwords Auction" (https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2012/10/27/google-adwords-auction-a-second-price-sealed-bid-auction)] but it doesn't prevent search users from  overpaying when they click disguised advertisements.
This manipulative search is not unique to Google, but any search engine that ranks results according to any other "objective function" other than your satisfaction with the search results.
But here they are, if you want to compare and experiment.

* Google
* Bing
* Baidu

### Less manipulative search engines

To determine how "commercial" and manipulative a search engine was, I queried several engines with things like "open source search engine".
I then counted the number of ad-words purchasers and click-bait sites were among the search results in the top 10.
The following sites kept that count below one or two.
And the top search results were often the most objective and useful sites, such as Wikipedia, Stack Exchange, or reputable news articles and blogs.

* Alternatives to Google (https://www.lifehack.org/374487/try-these-15-search-engines-instead-google-for-better-search-results) footnote:[See the web page titled "Search Engines Instead of Google For Better Search Results" (https://www.lifehack.org/374487/try-these-15-search-engines-instead-google-for-better-search-results).]
* Yandex (https://yandex.com/search/?text=open%20source%20search%20engine&lr=21754) -- Surprisingly, the most popular Russian search engine (60% of Russian searches) seemed less manipulative than the top US search engines.
* DuckDuckGo (https://duckduckgo.com)
* `Watson` Semantic Web Search (http://watson.kmi.open.ac.uk/WatsonWUI) -- No longer in development, and not really a full text web search, but it is an interesting way to explore the semantic web (at least what it was years ago before `watson` was frozen)

### Distributed search engines

Distributed search engines footnote:[See the web page titled "Distributed search engine - Wikipedia" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_search_engine).] footnote:[See the web page titled "Distributed Search Engines - P2P Foundation" (https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Distributed_Search_Engines).] are perhaps the least manipulative and most "objective" because they have no central server to influence the ranking of the search results.
However, current distributed search implementations rely on TF-IDF word frequencies to rank pages, because of the difficulty in scaling and distributing semantic search NLP algorithms.
However, distribution of semantic indexing approaches such as latent semantic analysis (LSA) and locality sensitive hashing have been successfully distributed with nearly linear scaling (as good as you can get).
It's just a matter of time before someone decides to contribute code for semantic search into an open source project like Yacy or builds a new distributed search engine capable of LSA.

* Nutch (https://nutch.apache.org/) -- Nutch spawned Hadoop and itself became less of a distributed search engine and more of a distributed HPC system over time.
* Yacy (https://www.yacy.net/en/index.html) -- One of the few open source (https://github.com/yacy/yacy_search_server) decentralized, or federated, search engines and web crawlers still actively in use. Preconfigured clients for Mac, Linux, and Windows are available.
