RUSSIAN CONTACTS WITH THE CAMPAIGN

The presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump (“Trump Campaign” or “Campaign”)
showed interest in WikiLeaks’s releases of documents and welcomed their potential to damage
candidate Clinton. Beginning in June 2016, former Campaign member Roger Stone forecast to
senior Campaign officials that WikiLeaks would release information damaging to candidate
Clinton. WikiLeaks’s first release came in July 2016. Around the same time, candidate Trump
announced that he hoped Russia would recover emails described as missing from a private server
used by Clinton when she was Secretary of State (he later said that he was speaking sarcastically).
Stone stayed in regular contact with the Campaign claiming to have information about future
releases by WikiLeaks, while privately asking his own associates to contact WikiLeaks founder
Julian Assange and publicly boasting of his access to Assange. WikiLeaks began releasing
Podesta’s stolen emails on October 7, 2016, less than one hour after a U.S. media outlet released
video considered damaging to candidate Trump. Section III of this Report details the Office’s
investigation into the Russian hacking operations, as well as other efforts by Trump Campaign
supporters to obtain Clinton-related emails.
RUSSIAN CONTACTS WITH THE CAMPAIGN

The social media campaign and the GRU hacking operations coincided with a series of
contacts between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government.
The Office investigated whether those contacts reflected or resulted in the Campaign conspiring
or coordinating with Russia in its election-interference activities. Although the investigation
established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and
worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from
information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that
members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its
election interference activities.

The Russian contacts consisted of business connections, offers of assistance to the
Campaign, invitations for candidate Trump and Putin to meet in person, invitations for Campaign
officials and representatives of the Russian government to meet, and policy positions seeking
improved U.S.-Russian relations. Section IV of this Report details the contacts between Russia
and the Trump Campaign during the campaign and transition periods, the most salient of which
are summarized below in chronological order.

Second, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to
the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was
not sufficient to support criminal charges. Among other things, the evidence was not sufficient to
charge any Campaign official as an unregistered agent of the Russian government or other Russian
principal. And our evidence about the June 9, 2016 meeting and WikiLeaks ' s releases of hacked
materials was not sufficient to charge a criminal campaign-finance violation . Further, the evidence
was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired with
representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.

individuals and related matters. Those lies materially impaired the investigation of Russian
election interference. The Office charged some of those lies as violations of the federa l falsestatements statute. Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about
his interactions with Russian Ambassador Kislyak during the transition period. George

Ill. RUSSIAN HACKING AND DUMPING OPERATIONS
Beginning in March 2016, units of the Russian Federation's Main Intelligence Directorate
of the General Staff (GRll) hacked the computers and email accounts of organizations, e·m ployees,
and volunteers supporting the Clinton Campaign, including the email account of campaign
chairman John Podesta. Starting in April 20 16, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National
Committee (DNC). The GRU targeted hundreds of email accounts used by Clinton Campaign
employees, advisors, and volunteers. In total, the GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents
from the compromised email accounts and networks. 109 The GRU later released stolen Clinton
Campaign and DNC documents through online personas, "DCLeaks" and "Guccifer 2.0," and later
through the organization WikiLeaks. The release of the documents was designed and timed to
interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election and undermine the Clinton Campaign.

Beginning in March 2016, units of the Russian Federation’s Main Intelligence Directorate
of the General Staff (GRU) hacked the computers and email accounts of organizations, employees,

chairman John Podesta. Starting in April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National

through the organization WikiLeaks. The release of the documents was designed and timed to
interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election and undermine the Clinton Campaign.
The Trump Campaign showed interest in the WikiLeaks releases and, in the summer and
fall of 2016, Roger Stone tried to connect with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange through
intermediaries. Stone boasted to senior Campaign officials about his access to Assange. After
Stone’s prediction of WikiLeaks’s first Clinton-related release proved true, the Trump Campaign
stayed in contact with Stone about WikiLeaks’s activities. The investigation was unable to resolve
whether Stone played a role in WikiLeaks’s release of the stolen Podesta emails on October 7,
2016, the same day a video from years earlier was published of Trump using graphic language
about women.

a. Background

a. Background
Roger Stone has known President Trump for many years and was an advisor to the Trump
Campaign from close to its inception until approximately August 2015. After leaving the
Campaign in August 2015, Stone continued to promote the Campaign and maintained regular
contact with Trump Campaign members, including candidate Trump and, when they joined the
Campaign, with campaign officials Paul Manafort, Steve Bannon, and Rick Gates. According to
multiple witnesses involved with the Campaign, beginning in June 2016 and continuing through
October 2016, Stone spoke about WikiLeaks with senior Campaign officials, including candidate
Trump.

b. Contacts with the Campaign about WikiLeaks

Stone has publicly denied having any direct contact with Assange and claimed not to have
had any discussions with an intermediary connected to Assange until July or August 2016.193
Other members and associates of the Trump Campaign, however, told the Office that Stone
claimed to the Campaign as early as June 2016—before any announcement by Assange or
WikiLeaks—that he had learned that WikiLeaks would release documents damaging to the Clinton
Campaign. On June 12, 2016, Assange claimed in a televised interview to “have emails relating
to Hillary Clinton which are pending publication,”194 but provided no additional context.

'-Hille'" which are pending publication,,,194 but provided no additional context.

In debriefings with the Office, former deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates said that,
before Assange’s June 12 announcement, Gates and Stone had a phone conversation in which
Stone said something “big” was coming and had to do with a leak of information.195 Stone also
said to Gates that he thought Assange had Clinton emails. Gates asked Stone when the information
was going to be released. Stone said the release would happen very soon. According to Gates,
between June 12, 2016 and July 22, 2016, Stone repeated that information was coming. Manafort
and Gates both called to ask Stone when the release would happen, and Gates recalled candidate
Trump being generally frustrated that the Clinton emails had not been found.196

WikiLeaks and believed that there would be an imminent release of emails by WikiLeaks.198

Michael Cohen, former executive vice president of the Trump Organization and special
counsel to Donald J. Trump,199 told the Office that he recalled an incident in which he was in
candidate Trump’s office in Trump Tower when Stone called. Cohen believed the call occurred
before July 22, 2016, when WikiLeaks released its first tranche of Russian-stolen DNC emails.200
Stone was patched through to the office and placed on speakerphone. Stone then told the candidate
that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and in a couple of days WikiLeaks would
release information. According to Cohen, Stone claimed that he did not know what the content of
the materials was and that Trump responded, “oh good, alright” but did not display any further
reaction.201 Cohen further told the Office that, after WikiLeaks’s subsequent release of stolen
DNC emails in July 2016, candidate Trump said to Cohen something to the effect of, “I guess
Roger was right.”202
After WikiLeaks’s July 22, 2016 release of documents, Stone participated in a conference
call with Manafort and Gates. According to Gates, Manafort expressed excitement about the
release and congratulated Stone.203 Manafort, for his part, told the Office that, shortly after
WikiLeaks’s July 22 release, Manafort also spoke with candidate Trump and mentioned that Stone
had predicted the release and claimed to have access to WikiLeaks. Candidate Trump responded
that Manafort should stay in touch with Stone.204 Manafort relayed the message to Stone, likely
on July 25, 2016.205 Manafort also told Stone that he wanted to be kept apprised of any

Cohen described the content of the call in an initial interview with our Office and its timing in
a later interview. With respect to timing, Cohen stated that he believed the call would have been in July
2016, based on his own travel schedule and other factors. Cohen 8/7/18 302, at 8. Cohen believes that
WikiLeaks had not released any campaign-related documents at the time, and that Stone’s telephone call
was prior to the release of stolen DNC documents on July 22, 2016. In February 2019 congressional
testimony, Cohen stated he believed the conversation in question occurred on “either the 18th or 19th and
I would guess that it would be on the 19th” of July. See Testimony of Michael D. Cohen, Committee on

developments with WikiLeaks and separately told Gates to keep in touch with Stone about future
WikiLeaks releases.206
According to Gates, by the late summer of 2016, the Trump Campaign was planning a
press strategy, a communications campaign, and messaging based on the possible release of
Clinton emails by WikiLeaks.207 Gates also stated that Stone called candidate Trump multiple
times during the campaign.208 Gates recalled one lengthy telephone conversation between Stone
and candidate Trump that took place while Trump and Gates were driving to LaGuardia Airport.
Although Gates could not hear what Stone was saying on the telephone, shortly after the call
candidate Trump told Gates that more releases of damaging information would be coming.209
Stone also had conversations about WikiLeaks with Steve Bannon, both before and after
Bannon took over as the chairman of the Trump Campaign. Bannon recalled that, before joining
the Campaign on August 13, 2016, Stone told him that he had a connection to Assange. Stone
implied that he had inside information about WikiLeaks. After Bannon took over as campaign
chairman, Stone repeated to Bannon that he had a relationship with Assange and said that
WikiLeaks was going to dump additional materials that would be bad for the Clinton Campaign.210

Three days after WikiLeaks released stolen DNC documents on July 22, 2016, Stone sent
an email to his associate Jerome Corsi directing him to “[g]et to Assange [a]t Ecuadorian Embassy
in London and get the pending [WikiLeaks] emails . . . they deal with Foundation, allegedly.”211
Corsi is an author who holds a doctorate in political science.212 In 2016, Corsi also worked for the
media outlet WorldNetDaily (WND). Corsi first met Stone in early 2016 and began having
recorded conversations with Stone that Corsi intended to use as content for WND. According to
Corsi, by March 2016, Corsi stopped making recordings with Stone and began to be more of a
self-described “operative” for Stone, seeking to assist the Trump Campaign in a personal
capacity.213

Malloch stated to investigators that beginning in or about August 2016, he and Corsi had
multiple FaceTime discussions about WikiLeaks and Stone. On these calls, Corsi stated that Stone
had made a connection to Assange and that the hacked emails of John Podesta would be released

Beginning in August 2016, Stone began to communicate with another associate, Randy
Credico, about WikiLeaks. Credico, a New York radio show host, interviewed Assange on August
25, 2016.222 On August 26, 2016, Credico sent a text message to Stone that read “Julian Assange
talk[ed] about you last night.”223 Stone asked what Assange said, to which Credico responded,
“He didn’t say anything bad we were talking about how the Press is trying to make it look like you
and he are in cahoots.”224 The following day, Credico sent a text message stating, “Julian Assange
has kryptonite on Hillary.”225

In September 2016, Stone asked Credico to pass along a request to Assange for any emails

was serving as Secretary of State.226 Credico agreed to pass along the request and sent the request
to an attorney who had regular contact with WikiLeaks. He included Stone on the email as a blind
copy.227 (In an interview with the Office, the attorney stated that she did not communicate the
request to WikiLeaks.228)
In late September and early October 2016, Credico and Stone communicated about possible
upcoming WikiLeaks releases. On October 1, 2016, Credico sent Stone text messages that read,

Stone wrote Credico asking, “Did Assange back off.” Credico initially responded, “I can’t tal[k]

and her people are doing a full-court press they keep Assange from making the next dump . . .
that’s all I can tell you on this line . . . Please leave my name out of it.”231 During an interview in
December 2018, Credico told the Office that he had not heard that claim from anyone specific and
did not recall why he wrote it to Stone.232
Stone repeated Credico’s October 2016 predictions about WikiLeaks to multiple people,
including persons involved with the Trump Campaign.233 On October 3, 2016, Stone received an
email from a reporter asking, “[Assange] – what’s he got? Hope it’s good.” Stone responded, “It
is. I’d tell Bannon but he doesn’t call me back.”234 On October 3, 2016, Stone emailed Erik
Prince—a campaign donor and occasional informal advisor, see Volume I, Section IV.B.2.a—to
say “Spoke to my friend in London last night. The payload is still coming.”235 The following day,
Prince emailed Stone to ask whether he had “hear[d] anymore from London.” Stone responded,
“Yes – want to talk on a secure line – got Whatsapp.”236 According to Prince, Stone and Prince
did speak subsequently, and Stone said that WikiLeaks would release more materials that would
be damaging to the Clinton Campaign. Stone also indicated to Prince that he had what Prince
described as almost “insider stock trading” type information about Assange.237 On October 4,
2016, after Assange completed a press conference without announcing new releases, Bannon
emailed Stone, “What was that this morning???” and asked if Assange had “cut a deal w/ Clintons.”

affect the Campaign.
Less than an hour after the video ' s publication, WikiLeaks released the
first set of emails stolen by the GRU from the account of Clinton Campaign chairman
John Podesta.

On October 7, 2016, four days after the Assange press conference that Stone had discussed
with Trump Campaign officials, the Washington Post published an Access Hollywood video that
captured comments by candidate Trump some years earlier and that was expected to adversely
affect the Campaign.239 Less than an hour after the video’s publication, WikiLeaks released the
first set of emails stolen by the GRU from the account of Clinton Campaign chairman
John Podesta.
The Office investigated whether Roger Stone played any role in WikiLeaks’s
dissemination of the Podesta emails at that time. During his first September 2018 interview, Corsi
stated that he had refused Stone’s July 25, 2016 request to contact Assange, and that had been the
last time they had talked about contacting Assange.240 Email and text communications between
Stone and Corsi show that was false. During a later September 2018 interview, Corsi told the
Office that one of his WikiLeaks-related communications with Stone had occurred on October 7,
2016, just prior to WikiLeaks’s release.241 Corsi told the Office that he spoke with Stone before
publication of the Access Hollywood video and that Stone knew about the tape’s content and its
imminent release, both of which he relayed to Corsi.242

Corsi gave conflicting accounts of what happened after Stone purportedly informed him
about the video.243 Initially, Corsi told investigators that he had instructed Stone to have
WikiLeaks release information to counteract the expected reaction to the video’s release, and that
Stone said that was a good idea and would get it done. Later during the same interview, Corsi
stated that Stone had told Corsi to have WikiLeaks drop the Podesta emails immediately, and Corsi
told Stone he would do it. Corsi said that, because he had no direct means of communicating with
WikiLeaks, he told members of the news site WND—who were participating on a conference call
with him that day—to reach Assange immediately.244 Corsi claimed that the pressure was

The Office investigated Corsi’s allegations about the events of October 7, 2016 but found
little corroboration for his allegations about the day.248 In public statements, Stone has denied
having advance knowledge of the Access Hollywood tape.249 Telephone records show that, on the
morning of October 7, 2016, Stone had a conversation with a reporter from the Washington Post
(the first media outlet to publish the Access Hollywood video).250 However, the phone records
themselves do not indicate that the conversation was with any of the reporters who broke the
Access Hollywood story, and the Office has not otherwise been able to identify the substance of
the conversation. Telephone records show communication between Stone and Corsi on October
7, 2016, as well as Corsi’s participation in two conference calls that day.251 However, the Office
has not identified any conference call participant, or anyone who spoke to Corsi that day, who says
that they received non-public information about the tape from Corsi or acknowledged having

One witness told the Office at one point that the initial release of Podesta emails on October
7 may have come at the behest of, or in coordination with, Roger Stone, an associate of candidate
Trump. As explained in Volume I, Section III.D.1.d, supra, phone records show that Stone called
Jerome Corsi on October 7, after Stone received a call from the Washington Post. The Washington
Post broke a story later that day about a video recording of Trump speaking about women in
graphic terms. According to some of Corsi’s statements to the Office (b) (3)
Stone (b)(3)-1
said that he had learned about the imminent release of that tape recording, and it was expected to
generate significant negative media attention for the Campaign. Corsi told investigators that Stone
may have believed from their prior dealings that Corsi had connections to Julian Assange,
WikiLeaks’s founder, and that Stone therefore asked Corsi to tell Assange to start releasing the
Podesta emails immediately to shift the news cycle away from the damaging Trump recording.
Although Corsi denies that he actually had access to Assange, he told the Office at one point that
he tried to bring the request to Assange’s attention via public Twitter posts and by asking other
contacts to get in touch with Assange. The investigation did not establish that Corsi actually took
those steps, but WikiLeaks did release the first batch of Podesta emails later on the afternoon of
October 7, within an hour of the publication of the Washington Post’s story on the Trump tape.

The Office ultimately concluded that, even if the principal legal questions were resolved favorably
to the government, a prosecution would encounter difficulties proving that Campaign officials or
individuals connected to the Campaign willfully violated the law.

Finally, although the evidence of contacts between Campaign officials and Russiaaffiliated individuals may not have been sufficient to establish or sustain criminal charges, several
U.S. persons connected to the Campaign made false statements about those contacts and took other
steps to obstruct the Office' s investigation and those of Congress. This Office has therefore
charged some of those individuals with making false statements and obstructing justice.

As an initial matter, this Office evaluated potentially criminal conduct that involved the
collective action of multiple individuals not under the rubric of "collusion," but through the lens
of conspiracy law. In so doing, the Office recognized that the word "collud[ e]" appears in the
Acting Attorney General's August 2, 2017 memorandum; it has frequently been invoked in public
reporting; and it is sometimes referenced in antitrust law, see, e.g., Brooke Group v. Brown &
Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227 (1993). But collusion is not a specific offense or
theory of liability found in the U.S. Code; nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. To the
contrary, even as defined in legal dictionaries, collusion is largely synonymous with conspiracy as
that crime is set forth in the general federal conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. § 371. See Black 's Law

Trump traveling there- both with the candidate himself and with senior campaign official Corey
Lewandowski. Cohen did recall that he had received a response to the email that he sent to Russian

follow-up phone conversation with an English-speaking assistant to Peskov in mid-January 2016.

v. Roger Stone
As explained more fully in Volume I, Section III.D.1, supra, Roger Stone is a long-time
Trump associate, worked for the Trump Campaign briefly in 2015, and remained in contact with
senior Campaign officials through the campaign period. By no later than the summer of 2016,
Stone communicated with the Campaign about upcoming WikiLeaks releases of hacked materials
that were expected to harm Hillary Clinton’s candidacy. Indictment ¶ 5, United States v. Roger
Jason Stone, Jr., No. 1:19-cr-18 (D.D.C. Jan. 24, 2019), Doc. 1 (“Stone Indictment”). Stone sent
author Jerome Corsi messages urging him to “[g]et to” Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in
London, and received back correspondence from Corsi passing along “word [that] friend in
embassy plans 2 more dumps” in the summer and fall. Stone Indictment ¶ 13. Stone spoke
publicly about access to Assange and, after radio host Randy Credico interviewed Assange, Stone
asked Credico to contact and obtain information from Assange. Stone Indictment ¶¶ 14-15. And
in early October 2016, Stone assured individuals involved in the Campaign that a WikiLeaks
release was imminent. Stone Indictment ¶ 16.

When asked to appear before HPSCI and provide documents, Stone caused a letter to be
submitted to HPSCI in May 2017 stating that he had no relevant records. Stone Indictment ¶ 19.
During his testimony before HPSCI in September 2017, Stone testified in pertinent part that he did
not have emails with third parties about Assange or any documents referring to Assange; that his
references in August 2016 to being in contact with Assange had been references to
communications with a single “intermediary,” whom Stone later identified as Credico; that Stone
did not ask this intermediary to communicate anything to Assange or to do anything on Stone’s
behalf; that the intermediary did not communicate via text message or email about WikiLeaks with
Stone; and that Stone had never discussed his conversations with the intermediary with anyone in
the Trump Campaign. Stone Indictment ¶¶ 20-22, 25, 29, 31, 35. Each of these statements was
false. Stone had in his custody or control email communications with Corsi and Credico about
Assange and WikiLeaks. Stone’s August 2016 public statements about access to Assange were not
solely about communications through Credico, who had not yet interviewed or met Assange at the
time. Stone had asked Credico to pass along a message to Assange and find out information from
him. Stone and Credico had communicated extensively over text message about WikiLeaks. And
Stone had discussed his contacts to Assange and an imminent WikiLeaks release with the Trump
Campaign, including in the days leading to the October 7, 2016 release of the Podesta emails.
Stone Indictment ¶¶ 23, 28, 30, 32, 35.
After falsely telling Congress that Credico was his lone “intermediary” or “go-between,”
Stone repeatedly contacted Credico in an effort to prevent Credico from contradicting Stone’s
statements to HPSCI. Between November and December 17, 2017, Stone texted Credico urging
him to “[s]tonewall” and “[p]lead the Fifth,” and stating that he should do a “Frank Pentangeli”
before HPSCI, a reference to a character in the The Godfather: Part II who testified before a
