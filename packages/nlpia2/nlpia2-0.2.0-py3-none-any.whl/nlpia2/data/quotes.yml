  text: "The meaning of a word lies in its use."
  author: Ludwig Wittgenstein
  description: In his later days' _Philosophical Investigations_ Wittgenstein criticized his earlier writing about _ideal language_. He grew to appreciate that context determines what a word means and there is no "ideal language."

  text: "The universe is a dark forest. Every civilization is an armed hunter stalking through the trees like a ghost, gently pushing aside branches that block the path and trying to tread without sound. Even breathing is done with care. The hunter has to be careful, because everywhere in the forest are stealthy hunters like him. If he finds other life--another hunter, an angel or a demon, a delicate infant or a tottering old man, a fairy or a demigod--there's only one thing he can do: open fire and eliminate them. In this forest, hell is other people. An eternal threat that any life that exposes its own existence will be swiftly wiped out. This is the picture of cosmic civilization. It's the explanation for the Fermi Paradox."

Both the ocean and the iceberg are made of the same material. That the iceberg seems separate is only because it is in a different form. In reality, it is but a part of the vast ocean.…"

  text: "In the shooter hypothesis, a good marksman shoots at a target, creating a hole every ten centimeters. Now suppose the surface of the target is inhabited by intelligent, two-dimensional creatures. Their scientists, after observing the universe, discover a great law: "There exists a hole in the universe every ten centimeters." They have mistaken the result of the marksman's momentary whim for an unalterable law of the universe. The farmer hypothesis, on the other hand, has the flavor of a horror story: Every morning on a turkey farm, the farmer comes to feed the turkeys. A scientist turkey, having observed this pattern to hold without change for almost a year, makes the following discovery: "Every morning at eleven, food arrives." On the morning of Thanksgiving, the scientist announces this law to the other turkeys. But that morning at eleven, food doesn't arrive; instead, the farmer comes and kills the entire flock."

  text: "For the majority of people, what they love exists only in the imagination. The object of their love is not the man or woman of reality, but what he or she is like in their imagination. The person in reality is just a template used for the creation of this dream lover. Eventually, they find out the differences between their dream lover and the template. If they can get used to those differences, then they can be together. If not, they split up. It's as simple as that. You differ from the majority in one respect: You didn't need a template."

Anyway, my life passed day after day accompanied by this strange feeling, and before I knew it, I was old..."

  text: "My father then said, 'Mike, I've told you how dinosaurs went extinct. An asteroid crashed into the Earth. The world first became a sea of fire, and then sank into a prolonged period of darkness and coldness.… One night, you woke from a nightmare, saying that you had dreamt that you were back in that terrifying age. Let me tell you now what I wanted to tell you that night: If you really lived during the Cretaceous Period, you'd be fortunate. The period we live in now is far more frightening. Right now, species on Earth are going extinct far faster than during the late Cretaceous. Now is truly the age of mass extinctions! So, my child, what you're seeing is nothing. This is only an insignificant episode in a much vaster process. We can have no sea birds, but we can't be without oil. Can you imagine life without oil? Your last birthday, I gave you that lovely Ferrari and promised you that you could drive it after you turned fifteen. But without oil, it would be a pile of junk metal and you'd never drive it. Right now, if you want to visit your grandfather, you can get there on my personal jet and cross the ocean in a dozen hours or so. But without oil, you'd have to tumble in a sailboat for more than a month.… These are the rules of the game of civilization: The first priority is to guarantee the existence of the human race and their comfortable life. Everything else is secondary."

But when they gaze up at the stars, they turn sentimental and believe that if extraterrestrial intelligences exist, they must be civilizations bound by universal, noble, moral constraints, as if cherishing and loving different forms of life are parts of a self-evident universal code of conduct. I think it should be precisely the opposite: Let's turn the kindness we show toward the stars to members of the human race on Earth"

The three-billion-year history of life's evolution from self-reproducing molecules to civilization contains twists and romances that cannot be matched by any myth or epic. There is also the poetic vision of space and time in relativity, the weird subatomic world of quantum mechanics … these wondrous stories of science all possess an irresistible attraction. Through the medium of science fiction, I seek only to create my own worlds using the power of imagination, and to make known the poetry of Nature in those worlds, to tell the romantic legends that have unfolded between Man and Universe."

    text: "Ahh, it's just a cold dark night on the side of Everest"
    author: Brett Logan
    context: IT person in psyche department at Yale sneaked into the room where Alia Crum a 3rd year phd grad student was stressed to come up with something for her advisor the next friday morning.
    interpretation: Climbing everest is not a walk in the park, it's difficult. Getting a Ph.D. is hard work and stressful. The stress is not your fault, not a flaw. It's not that you are unworthy of the challenge. The times when you did well, usually it was associated of stress. Adversity in one's goal-related efforts cause us stress. So you can have a new mindset about the stress and recognize it as a normal part of pursuing a difficult goal.

    No one knows where the borderline between non-intelligent behavior and intelligent behavior lies; in fact, to suggest that a sharp borderline exists is probably silly. But essential elements for intelligence are certainly:

    to respond to situations very flexibly;
    to take advantage of fortuitous circumstances;
    to make sense out of ambiguous or contradictory messages;
    to recognize the relative importance of different elements of a situation;
    to find find similarities between situations despite differences which may separate them;
    to draw distinctions between situations despite similarities which may link them;
    to synthesize new concepts by taking old concepts and putting them together in new ways;
    to come up with ideas which are novel.

It may come as deep inner stillness or as a rush of overflowing emotion. It may seem to come from beyond us, without any provocation, or from within us, evoked by music or by a sleeping child. If we open our hearts at such moments, creation reveals itself to us in all it's unity and fullness. And when we return from such a moment of awareness, our hearts long to find some way to capture it in words forever, so that we can remain faithful to it's higher truth."

  context: "Words... They're innocent, neutral, precise, standing for this, describing that, meaning the other, so if you look after them you can build bridges across incomprehension and chaos. But when they get their corners knocked off, they're no good any more... I don't think writers are sacred, but words are. They deserve respect. If you get the right ones in the right order, you can nudge the world a little or make a poem which children will speak for you when you're dead."

  author:  proved highly convenient for modelling the economy, but it was long questioned even from within the discipline. At the end of the nineteenth century, the sociologist and economist Thorstein Veblen berated economic theory for depicting man as a \"self-contained globule of desire\", while the French polymath Henri Poincaré pointed out that it overlooked \"people's tendency to act like sheep\". He was right: we are not so different from herds as we might like to imagine. We follow social norms, typically preferring to do what we expect others will do and, especially if filled with fear or doubt, we tend to go with the crowd."

  text: "Evolution has no foresight. Complex machinery develops its own agendas. Brains -- cheat. Feedback loops evolve to promote stable heartbeats and then stumble upon the temptation of rhythm and music. The rush evoked by fractal imagery, the algorithms used for habitat selection, metastasize into art. Thrills that once had to be earned in increments of fitness can now be had from pointless introspection. Aesthetics rise unbidden from a trillion dopamine receptors, and the system moves beyond modeling the organism. It begins to model the very process of modeling. It consumes evermore computational resources, bogs itself down with endless recursion and irrelevant simulations. Like the parasitic DNA that accretes in every natural genome, it persists and proliferates and produces nothing but itself. Metaprocesses bloom like cancer, and awaken, and call themselves I."

  text: "Think about the emergence of the plow, the ox-drawn plow and the beginning of agriculture that came with it. Where before that you had hunter gatherer and then you had a horticulture kind-of digging stick, but not the plow. Well the world changed a lot with that, right. And a few of the changes, that at least some of the theorists believe in, is when the ox drawn plow started to proliferate, any culture that utilized it was able to start to actually cultivate grain. Because just with the digging stick you couldn't get enough grain for it to matter. Grain was a storable caloric surplus. They could make it through the famines. They could grow their populations. So the ones that used it got so much ahead that it became obligate and everybody used it. That corresponding with the use of a plow, animism went away everywhere that it existed. Because you can't talk about the spirit of the buffalo while beating the cow all day long to pull a plow. So the moment that we do animal husbandry of that kind where you have to beat the cow all day you have to say it's just a dumb animal. Man has dominion over Earth. And the nature of our religious and even spiritual ideas change. You went from women primarily using the digging stick to do the horticulture or gathering before that. Men doing the hunting stuff, to now men had to use the plow because the upper body strength really mattered. Women would have more miscarriages when they would do it when they were pregnant. So all the caloric supply started to come from men where it had been from both before and the ratio of male/female gods changed to being mostly male gods. That particular line of thought says that then  Feminism followed the tractor. And the rise of feminism in the west followed women being able to say we can do what men can because the male upper body strength wasn't differential once the internal combustion engine was much stronger. And we [women] can drive a tractor. ... The plow is also the beginning of the anthropocene. It was the beginning of us changing the environment radically to clearcut areas to make them useful for people. Which also changed the view of the web of life, where we're just a part of it, etc."

Even at a motor level, researchers have shown, and infant does not follow a set pattern of learning to walk or how to reach for something. each baby experiments with different ways of reaching for objects and over the course of several months discovers or selects his own motor solutions. When we try to envisage the neural basis of such individual learning, we might imagine a population of movements (and their neural correlates) being strengthened or pruned away by experience."

  text: "In the 1980's, Edelman's theory was so novel that it could not easily be fitted into any of the existing models, the paradigms of Neuroscience, and it was this, I think, which prevented its wide acceptance -- coupled with Edelman's at times dense and difficult writing. Edelman's theory was \"premature,\" so ahead of its time, so complex and demanding of new ways of thinking, that it was resisted, or ignored, in the 1980's, but in the next 20 or 30 years, with new technologies, we will be in a good position to verify parentheses or disprove close parentheses its ultimate tenants. It remains, for me, the most powerful and elegant explanation of how we humans and our brains construct are very individual selves and world."
