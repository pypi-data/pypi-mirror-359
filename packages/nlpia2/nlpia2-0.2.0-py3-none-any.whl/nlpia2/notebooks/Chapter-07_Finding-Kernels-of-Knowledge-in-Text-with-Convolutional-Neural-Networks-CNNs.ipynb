    "_Robust NLP_ is the study of approaches and techniques for building machines that are smart enough to handle unusual text from diverse sources.footnote:[Robin Jia's thesis on Robust NLP (https://robinjia.github.io/assets/pdf/robinjia_thesis.pdf) and his presentation with Kai-Wei Chang, He He and Sameer Singh (https://robustnlp-tutorial.github.io)]\n",

    "\n",

    "Without a dropout layer, your network will focus on the words and patterns and convolutional filters that helped it achieve the greatest accuracy boost.\n",

    "The best place in your neural network to install a dropout layer is close to the end, just before you run the fully connected linear layer that computes the predictions on a batch of data.\n",
    "This vector of weights passing into your linear layer are the outputs from your CNN and pooling layers.\n",
    "Each one of these values represents a sequence of words, or patterns of meaning and syntax.\n",
    "By hiding some of these patterns from your prediction layer, it forces your prediction layer to diversify its \"thinking.\"\n",
