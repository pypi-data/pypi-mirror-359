Overview
########

Nornir-salt package is a collection of plugins and functions to use together with Nornir framework.

Primary reason for developing nornir-salt is a need to extend Nornir functionality for the
sake of salt-nornir proxy minion module. However, all plugins included in nornir-salt can
be used standalone unless stated otherwise.

While it was possible to include all the plugins into salt-nornir proxy module, decision was made
that many of the plugins developed can be useful outside of salt-nornir proxy module scope.
