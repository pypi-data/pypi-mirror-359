# `nsidc-iceflow` Python Library

`nsidc-iceflow` is a Python library that provides the ability to search,
download, and access laser altimetry data from (pre-)Operation IceBridge and
ICESat/GLAS datasets. The library also supports International Terrestrial
Reference Frame (ITRF) transformations to facilitate comparisons across
datasets. `nsidc-iceflow` supports the following datasets:

| Dataset                                                  | Temporal Coverage             |
