This page aims to teach students and researchers interested in cryospheric
sciences about airborne altimetry and related data sets from NASAâ€™s
[IceBridge](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/icebridge/index.html) mission,
and satellite altimetry data from
[ICESat/GLAS](https://icesat.gsfc.nasa.gov/icesat/) and
[ICESat-2](https://icesat-2.gsfc.nasa.gov/). Accessing and combining data from
these different missions can be difficult as file formats and coordinate
reference systems changed over time.

## Mission Overview

In 2003, NASA launched the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite mission with
the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (ICESat/GLAS) instrument onboard. Over the
following six years, ICESat/GLAS collected valuable ice thickness data in the
Polar Regions. Unfortunately, the ICESat/GLAS mission ended in 2009 before a
follow-up mission could be launched. An airborne campaign called Operation
IceBridge was funded to fill the gap and continue ice thickness measurements.
Between 2009 and 2019, Operation IceBridge flew numerous campaigns over
Greenland, the Antarctic ice sheets, and sea ice in the Arctic and Southern
Ocean. In September 2018, ICESat-2 was launched to continue NASA's collection of
ice, cloud and land elevation data.

### Pre-IceBridge

The Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) is a conically-scanning laser altimeter
that measures the surface topography of a swath of terrain directly beneath the
path of an aircraft. ATM surveys can be used to detect surface changes.
Differences of laser swaths surveyed over the same area but a few years apart
can be used to estimate elevation changes between the first and second survey.
Comparing the surveys conducted 1993-4 and 1998-9 resulted in the first
comprehensive assessment of the mass balance change of the Greenland ice sheet
([Krabill et al., 1999](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/283/5407/1522),
[2000](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/289/5478/428)). ATM surveys can
also be used to calibrate/validate satellite altimeter measurements (e.g.
[Martin et al., 2005](https://atm.wff.nasa.gov/files/browser/ATM_Calibration_Procedures_and_Accuracy_Assessment_2012.pdf)).
The ATM was deployed on a wide variety of platforms, including the NASA P3, a
Chilean Navy P3, a US Navy P3, the NASA DC8, the NCAR C-130, and a half-dozen
Twin Otters to collected high quality topographic data. For a complete list of
the ATM deployments visit
[https://atm.wff.nasa.gov/deployments/](https://atm.wff.nasa.gov/deployments/)

### ICESat/GLAS

ICESat/GLAS was the benchmark Earth Observing System mission for measuring ice
sheet mass balance, cloud and aerosol heights, as well as land topography and
vegetation characteristics. From 2003 to 2009, the ICESat/GLAS mission provided
multi-year elevation data for ice sheet mass balance as well as stratospheric
cloud property information over polar areas. This mission also provided
topographic and vegetation data from around the globe beyond the polar-specific
ice height information over the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Launched on
12 January 2003, after seven years in orbit and 18 laser-operation campaigns,
the ICESat/GLAS science mission ended due to the failure of its primary
instrument in 2009.

### IceBridge

The operation IceBridge was with its surveying flights from 2009 to 2019 the
largest airborne survey of the Earth's polar ice. It has yielded an
unprecedented three-dimensional view of the Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets, ice
shelves and sea ice. The flights provide a yearly, multi-instrument look at the
behavior of the rapidly changing features of the polar ice. Data collected
during Operation IceBridge helps scientists bridge the gap in polar satellite
observations between ICESat/GLAS (2003-2009) and ICESat-2 (2018-present).
Although the IceBridge data are not continuous its mission became critical for
extending the ice altimetry time series in the Arctic and Antarctic, after
ICESat/GLAS stopped collecting data in 2009.

IceBridge flights were generally conducted in March-May over Greenland and in
October-November over Antarctica.

### ICESat-2

The ICESat-2 mission was designed to provide elevation data needed to determine
ice sheet mass balance as well as vegetation canopy information. It provides
topographic measurements of cities, lakes and reservoirs, oceans and land
surfaces around the globe. The sole instrument on ICESat-2 is the Advanced
Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), a space-based Lidar. It was designed
and built at Goddard Space Flight Center, with the laser generation and
detection systems provided by Fibertek. ATLAS measures the travel time of laser
photons from the satellite to Earth and back; travel times from multiple laser
pulses are used to determine elevation data.

We recommend using the [_icepyx_](https://github.com/icesat2py/icepyx)
library to access and interact with ICESat-2 data. Learn more about using `icepyx` with `nsidc-iceflow` in the [Using nsidc-iceflow with icepyx to Generate an Elevation Timeseries](notebooks/iceflow-with-icepyx) Jupyter notebook.

### ILVIS2 data

ILVIS2 contain multiple sets of latitude/longitude/elevation values.

- `GLAT`/`GLON`/`GZ` represent the center of the lowest mode in the waveform.
- `HLAT`/`HLON`/`HZ` represent the center of the highest detected mode within
  the waveform. Both of these sets of lat/lon/elev are available across v1 and
  v2 ILIVS data.

ILVIS V1 data:

- `CLAT`/`CLON`/`ZC` represent the centroid of the corresponding LVIS Level-1B
  waveform.

ILVIS V2 data:

- `TLAT`/`TLON`/`ZT`, which represent the highest detected signal.

By default, `nsidc-iceflow` will use `GLAT`/`GLON`/`GZ` as the primary
latitude/longitude/elevation fields in `IceflowDataFrame`s. Use the
`ilvis2_coordinate_set` kwarg on `read_iceflow_datafile(s)` or
`make_iceflow_parquet` to select an different primary set of
latitude/longitude/elevation fields. Alternatively, manually set the fields:

```
# TLAT/TLON/TZ are only available in ILVIS2v2 data:
sel_ilvis2v2 = data.dataset == "ILVIS2v2"
data.loc[sel_ilvis2v2, ["latitude", "longitude", "elevation"]] = data.loc[sel_ilvis2v2, ["TLAT", "TLON", "ZT"]]
```

## Challenges

The wealth of data from these missions presents an opportunity to study the
evolution of ice thickness over several decades. However, combining data from
these missions presents several challenges:

- Data from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) flown during the IceBridge
  campaigns is stored in four different file formats. ICESat/GLAS and ICESat-2
  data are also in different file formats. Therefore, the data needs to be
  harmonized, that means placed into similar formats before comparisons can be
  made.
- The coordinate reference systems used to locate measurements have changed over
  the years, as the Earth's surface is not static and changes shape. To account
  for these changes, terrestrial reference frames that relate latitude and
  longitude to points on the Earth are updated on a regular basis. Since the
  launch of ICESat/GLAS, the International Terrestrial Reference Frame
  [(ITRF)](https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/DataProducts/ITRF/itrf.html) has been
  updated three times. The geolocation of a point measured at the beginning of
  the record and the end of the record is not the same even though the latitude
  and longitude is the same. These changes in geolocation need to be reconciled
  to allow meaningful comparisons within the long-term data record.

The `nsidc-iceflow` Python library addresses these concerns by providing the
ability to search, download, and access laser altimetry data from
(pre-)Operation IceBridge and ICESat/GLAS datasets. The library also supports
International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) transformations to facilitate
comparisons across datasets.

Companion Jupyter notebooks give additional information and contain example code
about `nsidc-iceflow`.

[NSIDC Iceflow example](./notebooks/iceflow-example) provides an example of how
to search for, download, and interact with `ILATM1B v1` data for a small area of
interest. This notebook also illustrates how to perform
[ITRF](https://itrf.ign.fr/) transformations to facilitate comparisons across
datasets. To learn more about ITRF transformations, see the
[Applying Coordinate Transformations to Facilitate Data Comparison](./notebooks/corrections)
notebook.

[Using nsidc-iceflow with icepyx to Generate an Elevation Timeseries](./notebooks/iceflow-with-icepyx)
shows how to search for, download, and interact with a large amount of data
across many datasets supported by `nsidc-iceflow`. It also illustrates how to
utilize [icepyx](https://icepyx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to find and access
ICESat-2 data. Finally, the notebook provides a simple time-series analysis for
elevation change over an area of interest across `nsidc-iceflow` supported
datasets and ICESat-2.
