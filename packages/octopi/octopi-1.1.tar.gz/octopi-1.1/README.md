**O**bject dete**CT**ion **O**f **P**rote**I**ns. A deep learning framework for Cryo-ET 3D particle picking with autonomous model exploration capabilities.

## üöÄ Introduction

octopi addresses a critical bottleneck in cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) research: the efficient identification and extraction of proteins within complex cellular environments. As advances in cryo-ET enable the collection of thousands of tomograms, the need for automated, accurate particle picking has become increasingly urgent.

Our deep learning-based pipeline streamlines the training and execution of 3D autoencoder models specifically designed for cryo-ET particle picking. Built on [copick](https://github.com/copick/copick), a storage-agnostic API, octopi seamlessly accesses tomograms and segmentations across local and remote environments. 

## üß© Core Features

- **3D U-Net Training**: Train and evaluate custom 3D U-Net models for particle segmentation
- **Automatic Architecture Search**: Explore optimal model configurations using Bayesian optimization via Optuna
- **Flexible Data Access**: Seamlessly work with tomograms from local storage or remote data portals
- **HPC Ready**: Built-in support for SLURM-based clusters
- **Experiment Tracking**: Integrated MLflow support for monitoring training and optimization
- **Dual Interface**: Use via command-line or Python API

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install octopi
```

### Basic Usage

octopi provides two main command-line interfaces:

```bash
# Main CLI for training, inference, and data processing
octopi --help
```

The main `octopi` command provides subcommands for:
- Data import and preprocessing
- Training label preparation
- Model training and exploration
- Inference and particle localization

```bash
# HPC-specific CLI for submitting jobs to SLURM clusters
octopi-slurm --help
```

The `octopi-slurm` command provides utilities for:
- Submitting training jobs to SLURM clusters
- Managing distributed inference tasks
- Handling batch processing on HPC systems
