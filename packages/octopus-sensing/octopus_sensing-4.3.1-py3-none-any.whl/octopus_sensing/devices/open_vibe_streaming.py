class OpenVibeStreaming(Device):
    '''
    Sending triggers to OpenVibe data recorders. OpenVibe supports data acquisition through
    many biosensors. We can record data through OpenVibe and send markers using this class.

    Attributes
    ----------

    Parameters
    ----------
    host: str
        host IP address

    port: int
        port number

    Example
    -------
    Creating an instance of OpenVibeStreaming in the local machine and adding it to the device_coordinator

    >>> device_coordinator = DeviceCoordinator()
    >>> openvibe_device = OpenVibeStreaming()
    >>> device_coordinator.add_devices([openvibe_device])

    Note
    -----
    We need a scenario in OpenVibe to record data. OpenVibe should start data recording before sending the triggers.
