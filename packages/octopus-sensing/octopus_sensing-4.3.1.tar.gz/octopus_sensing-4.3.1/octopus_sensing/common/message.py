class Message():
    '''
    Message class. 
    It is being used for communicating between DeviceCoordinator and various devices.
    DeviceCoordinator uses message objects to inform devices about an event

    Attributes
    ----------

    Parameters
    ----------
    type: str
        The type of message
    
    payload: Any
        the message data that can have differnt values
    
    experiment_id: str, default: None
        A unique ID for each participant and task in the study
    
    stimulus_id: str, default: None
        A unique ID for each stimulus
    

    Example
    -------
    We can create a customized message using this class, or use prepared messages in the common/message_creators.
    In this example, we created an instance of message, which its type is start. When DeviceCoordinator
    dispath this message, it will be sent to all devices in its list.
    Using this message we inform all devices that start of `stimulus_00` is happened.

    >>> message = Message("START",
    ...                   "study_1_p10",
    ...                   "stimulus_00")
    >>> device_coordinator.dispatch(message)
