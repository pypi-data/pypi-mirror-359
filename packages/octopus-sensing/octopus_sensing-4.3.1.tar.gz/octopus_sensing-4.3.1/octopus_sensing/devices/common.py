    In CONTINIOUS_SAVING_MODE all data will be saved in one file, and some markers
    will be used to specify an event. In SEPARATED_SAVING_MODE, the data related to different events
    will be saved in separate files. 
    For example, if stimuli is a list of videos, in CONTINIOUS_SAVING_MODE, the data recorded
    during displaying all videos, will be recorded in a file and two markers one for start 
    and one for the stop of each video will be recorded in the data. In SEPARATED_SAVING_MODE for 
    each video stimuli, the data recorded while displaying each video will be recorded in 
    a separated file.
