    '''
    Preprocess openbci recorded files to prepare them for visualizing and analysis
    It applys data cleaning (according to signal_preprocess), resampling (according to sampling_rate),
    and splits data if data has been recorded continuously.
    This method uses `mne library <https://mne.tools/stable/index.html>`_ for EEG data processing

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_path: str
        The path to recorded openbci data
    
    file_name: str
        The file name of recorded openbci data
    
    output_path: str
        preprocessed file path
    
    channels: List(str)
        a list of recorded channels name
    
    saving_mode: int, default: SavingModeEnum.CONTINIOUS_SAVING_MODE
        The saving mode of recorded data. If it is CONTINIOUS_SAVING_MODE, data will be splitted
        according to markers and will be recorded in the separated files

    sampling_rate: int, default: 128
        The desired sampling_rate. Data will be resampled according to this sampling rate
    
    signal_preprocess: bool, default: True
        If True will apply preliminary preprocessing steps to clean line noises
    
    Note
    -----
    Sometimes recorded data in one second with Openbci are less or more than 
    the specified sampling rate. So, we resample data by replicating
    the last samples or removing some samples to achieve the desired sampling_rate
