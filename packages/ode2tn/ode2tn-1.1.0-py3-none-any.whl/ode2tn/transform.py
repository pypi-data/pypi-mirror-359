    """
    Plot transcription network (TN) ODEs and initial values.

    For arguments other than odes, inits, gamma, and beta, see the documentation for
    `plot` in the gpac library.

    Args:
        odes: polynomial ODEs,
            dict of sp symbols or strings (representing symbols) to sympy expressions or strings or floats
            (representing RHS of ODEs)
            Raises ValueError if any of the ODEs RHS is not a polynomial

        inits: initial values,
            dict of sympy symbols or strings (representing symbols) to floats

        gamma: coefficient of the negative linear term in the transcription network

        beta: additive constant in x_top ODE

        scale: "scaling factor" for the transcription network ODEs. Each variable `x` is replaced by a pair
            (`x_top`, `x_bot`). The initial `x_bot` value is `scale`, and the initial `x_top` value is
            `x*scale`.

        show_factors: if True, then in addition to plotting the ratios x_top/x_bot,
            also plot the factors x_top and x_bot separately in a second plot.
            Mutually exlusive with `symbols_to_plot`, since it is equivalent to setting
            `symbols_to_plot` to ``[ratios, factors]``, where ratios is a list of dependent symbols
            `x=x_top/x_bot`, and factors is a list of symbols with the transcription factors `x_top`, `x_bot`,
            for each original variable `x`.

        latex_legend: If True, surround each symbol name with dollar signs, unless it is already surrounded with them,
            so that the legend is interpreted as LaTeX. If this is True, then the symbol name must either
            start and end with `$`, or neither start nor end with `$`. Unlike in the gpac package, this is True
            by default. The names of transcription factors are automatically surrounded by dollar signs.
            This option makes sure the legend showing original variables (or dependent symbols) also have `$` added
            so as to be interpreted as LaTeX.

        resets:
            If specified, this is a dict mapping times to "configurations"
            (i.e., dict mapping symbols/str to values).
            The configurations are used to set the values of the symbols manually during the ODE integration
            at specific times.
            Any symbols not appearing as keys in `resets` are left at their current values.
            The keys can either represent the `x_top` or `x_bot` variables whose ratio represents the original variable
            (a key in parameter `odes`), or the original variables themselves.
            If a new `x_top` or `x_bot` variable is used, its value is set directly.
            If an original variable `x` is used, its then the `x_top` and `x_bot` variables are set
            as with transforming `inits` to `tn_inits` in `ode2tn`:
            `x_top` is set to `x*scale`, and `x_bot` is set to `scale`.
            The OdeResult returned (the one returned by `solve_ivp` in scipy) will have two additional fields:
            `reset_times` and `reset_indices`, which are lists of the times and indices in `sol.t`
            corresponding to the times when the resets were applied.
            Raises a ValueError if any time lies outside the integration interval, or if `resets` is empty,
            if a symbol is invalid, or if there are symbols representing both an original variable `x` and one of
            its `x_top` or `x_bot` variables.

        existing_factors: iterable of symbols (or strings with names of symbols) to "pass through" unchanged.
            These symbols are not transformed into `x_top` and `x_bot` variables, but are interpreted as
            being transcription factors already. Raises exception if any of these symbols are
            not in the original ODEs. Also raises exception if any have an ode not of the form
            required as a transcriptional network: a Laurent polynomial in the variables with a single negative
            term `-gamma * x`, where `x` is the transription factor.

        verify_negative_term: If False, then do not check that the existing factors
            have an ODE with a single negative term of the form `-gamma*x`. The default is True, but this can lead to
            false positives. If one constructs a sympy expression such as `expr- gamma*x`, it could be that expr
            can be simplyfied to `alpha*x` for some constant `alpha` > `gamma`. Then the expression would be
            simplified to `(alpha-gamma)*x`, so would no longer have a negative term (or if `alpha < gamma`, it would
            have a negative term, but with the wrong coefficient `(alpha-gamma)` instead of `gamma`). However,
            since one writing an ODE by hand would tend to write it already in simplified form (e.g.,
            it would be awkward to write `odes = {x: 1.7*x - 0.5*x}` rather than simply `odes = {x: 1.2*x}`),
            we leave the check on by default. Only turn off this check if you are confident that the
            ODEs already contain a negative term of the form `-gamma*x`.
            It is still verified that the ODE is a Laurent polynomial; since this condition is independent of
            the form of the expression.

    Returns:
        Typically None, but if return_ode_result is True, returns the result of the ODE integration.
        See documentation of `gpac.plot` for details.
