This module provides a Liquidity Forecast Report based on user-defined parameters.

To launch the report wizard, navigate to Accounting/Invoicing > Reporting > Liquidity Forecast.
A configuration wizard will open, allowing you to define the parameters for the report.

The report begins from the current date and includes the following configurable options:

- Date To: Specifies the end date for the report. Data will be collected up to this date.
- Period Length (Month, Week, Day): Defines the granularity of the time intervals displayed in the report.
- Target Moves: Allows you to include or exclude draft journal entries in the report.


You can also add extra planning items representing expected cash inflows or outflows on specific dates.
To do this, go to Accounting/Invoicing > Accounting > Liquidity Forecast Planning Items.

This tool helps provide a clear and customizable view of your company's future liquidity position.
