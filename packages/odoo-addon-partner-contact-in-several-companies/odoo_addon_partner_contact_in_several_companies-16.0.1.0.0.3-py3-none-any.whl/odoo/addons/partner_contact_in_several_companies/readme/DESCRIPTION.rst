This module extends Odoo's Contacts app to **allow one contact to have several job
positions in different companies**. It is an essential add-on for handling the 'gig
economy' where people often work for several companies at a time (e.g., film and
television industry, contract developers, construction, etc.)

Contacts are categorized as either:

- **Standalone Contact** (default): A normal contact (either an Individual or a
  Company), though only Individual Standalone contacts can be linked to.
- **Attached to existing Contact**: Usually used when adding a contact under a Company, this contact is linked to a source Standalone Contact. Source contacts can only be Individuals, not Companies, nor can an Attached contact serve as the source of another Attached contact.
