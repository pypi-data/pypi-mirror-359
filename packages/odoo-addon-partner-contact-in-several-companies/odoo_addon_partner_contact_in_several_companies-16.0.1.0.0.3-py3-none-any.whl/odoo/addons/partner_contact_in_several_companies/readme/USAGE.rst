To add a new Standalone contact, add a contact as usual, either by itself or under an
existing contact's Contacts & Addresses tab (the Contact Type will be 'Standalone' by
default). Any Standalone Individual contact can serve as the source for Attached
contacts, whether that Standalone contact was added by itself or under an existing
Company's or Individual's Contacts & Addresses tab.

To add a new Attached contact:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Ensure that the source Standalone contact is already created, though you can create the Standalone contact on-the-fly if needed.
2. Open the contact under which you would like to add the Attached contact (usually a Company, but it could be an Individual).
3. On the Contacts & Addresses tab, click the Add button.
4. Choose the type of contact you are adding (e.g. Contact, Delivery Address, Other
   Address, etc., though usually you will select Contact).
5. Select 'Attached to existing Contact' for the Contact Type
6. Select the source Standalone contact in the Contact drop-down list (or create a new one on-the-fly). Only contacts that are Standalone and are Individuals will appear in the list.
7. Fill in the other informational fields (e.g. Address, Email, Phone, etc.) This data will not be copied or synchronized from the source Standalone contact.
8. Click the Save & Close button (or Save & New). The Attached contact will appear in the Contacts & Addresses tab of the parent Company, and in the Other Positions tab of the source Standalone contact.
9. If you later change the Name of either a Standalone or Attached contact, the Name will be synchronized between all related contacts. However, other information (e.g., Address, Email, Phone, etc.) will not be synchronized.

Searching for Contacts:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When searching for Contacts, only the matching Standalone contacts are displayed, with the number of Attached contacts shown as '+ # other position(s)'. Open the Standalone contact and select the Other Positions tab to see the contacts that are 'Attached' to this Standalone contact.

NOTES:
~~~~~~

1. This module merely sets up a relationship between the Standalone and Attached contacts â€” other than 'Name', there is no address, phone, email, etc. information synchronized or carried-over from one to the other. For example, an email address in the Standalone contact is not carried over to the Attached contact when created (and indeed they can both have different email addresses). The contact Name is however synchronized between Standalone and associated Attached contacts.
2. Attached contacts are not treated as duplicates when performing the Contact Merge action due to Attached contacts being specifically removed from the results of the res_partner.search() method (i.e. only Standalone contacts are returned during a res_partner.search()).
3. This module is compatible with the OCA's Partner Contact Access Link (partner_contact_access_link) module.
4. When you install this module, existing contacts will all become Standalone contacts. If there are any child contacts of Companies that you would like to convert to Attached to an existing contact, it is a manual process: create the new Standalone contact without any parent, and then change the child contact's Contact Type from 'Standalone' to 'Attached to existing Contact' and choose the new Standalone contact that you created without any parent.
