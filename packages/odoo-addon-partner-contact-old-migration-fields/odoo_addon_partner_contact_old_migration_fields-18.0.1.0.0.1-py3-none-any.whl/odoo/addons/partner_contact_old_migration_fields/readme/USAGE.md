To use this module:

1. Make sure the user belongs to the **Old Migration Fields Manager** group (configured via the base_old_migration_fields module).
2. Go to the **Contacts** module.
3. Open or create a contact record.
4. Navigate to the **Migration Info** tab.
5. Fill in or review the old system values (e.g., previous IDs or legacy codes).

This information is stored separately and does not affect the functional behavior of the contact. It is intended purely for migration tracking, audit, or synchronization purposes.
