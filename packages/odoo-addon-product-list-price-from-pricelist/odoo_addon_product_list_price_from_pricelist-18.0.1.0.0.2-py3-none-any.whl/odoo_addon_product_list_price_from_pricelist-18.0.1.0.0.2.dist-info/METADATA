This module enables the automatic computation of a product's sale price
based on the configuration of a pricelist.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

- Go to Sales -> Products -> Pricelists.
- Create a new pricelist and add at least one rule.
- Specify the product template or category for the rule.
- Set the computation mode and save

**Note**: Ensure the minimum quantity is not great than 1 for the rule
to apply effectively.

- Go to Sales -> Configuration -> Settings.
- In the Pricing section, select the Pricelist to compute sale price
  created in the previous step.
- Optionally and only with a multi-company environment enabled, set the
  Main company for compute sale price to restrict the computation to a
  specific company.
- Save the configuration

The module creates a cron job to update the product list price every
day. The cron job is disabled by default. To enable it, go to Settings
-> Technical -> Automation -> Scheduled Actions and search for Product
sale price: Update price from pricelist.

Usage
=====

**To update product prices according to the pricelist rules**

- Stay in the settings configuration with the selected Pricelist.
- Click the **Update Product Prices** button to apply the rules and
  update the sale prices of all products.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

The list_price field is not company-dependent, meaning that if a product
is shared across multiple companies, the same list price will apply to
all of them. To minimize errors, you can set a primary company to take
precedence. This can be configured in the settings under the field Main
company for computing sale price.
