In Odoo, products have their own invoicing policy that can be:

- Invoicing on ordered quantities
- Invoicing on ordered quantities

Following that configuration, when trying to create invoices from sale
orders, each line of product will apply its invoicing policy.

In some cases, user needs to apply an invoicing policy on a whole sale
order.

The solution proposed here is to add an invoicing policy on sale order
level.
