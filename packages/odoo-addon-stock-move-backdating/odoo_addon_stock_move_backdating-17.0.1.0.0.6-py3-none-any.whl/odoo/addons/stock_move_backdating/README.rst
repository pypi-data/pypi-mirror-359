This module allows users to register stock moves with a past date (i.e.,
a date different from the current one). It is especially useful for
accurately reflecting historical stock movements and maintaining correct
inventory records.

If *Perpetual Inventory Valuation* is enabled, the generated journal
entries will reflect the chosen backdated date accordingly.

Usage
=====

How to Use Backdated Stock Movement:

1. Transfer the products and process as usual until the status becomes
   ``Ready``.
2. Click ``Fill Actual Movement Date`` > select the backdate > click
   Apply.
3. The system will display the ``Forced Effective Date`` as the selected
   backdate.
4. Click Validate > check that the ``Stock Valuation Date`` and the
   ``Journal Entries`` (if using Perpetual Inventory Valuation) are
   backdated accordingly.
