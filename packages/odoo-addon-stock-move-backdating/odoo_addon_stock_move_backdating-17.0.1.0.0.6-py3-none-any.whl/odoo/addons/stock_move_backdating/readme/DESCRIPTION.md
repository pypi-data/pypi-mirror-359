This module allows users to register stock moves with a past date (i.e., a date different from the current one).
It is especially useful for accurately reflecting historical stock movements and maintaining correct inventory records.

If *Perpetual Inventory Valuation* is enabled, the generated journal entries will reflect the chosen backdated date accordingly.
