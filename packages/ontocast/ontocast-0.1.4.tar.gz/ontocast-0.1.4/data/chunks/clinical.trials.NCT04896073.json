ASCP is a highly aggressive type of pancreatic cancer. It is very rare. Researchers want to see if a drug called Minnelide can be used to treat ASCP.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo see if Minnelide is an effective treatment for ASCP.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults ages 18 and older with ASCP whose cancer did not respond to previous treatments.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\nMedical history\n\nPhysical exam\n\nBlood and urine samples\n\nEvaluation of ability to do daily activities\n\nElectrocardiogram to test heart function\n\nBody and/or brain scans. For these, participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body. They may have a contrast agent injected into a vein.\n\nTumor sample. If one is not available, participants will have a tumor biopsy. The biopsy will be taken with a small needle put through the skin into the tumor. Treatment will be given in 28-day cycles, for up to 12 cycles. There is a 7-day resting period between cycles. Participants will take Minnelide by mouth every day for 21 days of each cycle. They will keep a medicine diary. Participants will have at least 1 study visit every cycle. They will review their medicine diary. They will repeat some screening tests. Participants may have optional tumor biopsies. Some participants may need to take birth control during the study and for up to 6 months after treatment. Participants will have an end-of-treatment visit 4 weeks after they stop taking the study drug. They will repeat some screening tests.\n**detailedDescription**: Background: - Adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas (ASCP) is a highly aggressive variant of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), the most common type of pancreas cancer.\n- ASCP is estimated to account for 0.5-4% of the 55,000 people who are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the U.S. each year, making it a very rare tumor type.\n- No prospective clinical trials specific to ASCP have ever been performed.\n- Preclinical data in ASCP models indicate that an activated superenhancer network drives epigenetic changes which cause the prognostically unfavorable squamous differentiation.\n- Genomic analysis of ASCP tumors identifies frequent amplification of MYC.\n- Minnelide is a small molecule anti-superenhancer drug that inhibits MYC.\n- The recommended dose of Minnelide has previously been established through clinical testing for other indications.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\n-To determine the single agent antitumor activity (disease control rate) of the anti-superenhancer agent Minnelide in participants with advanced, previously treated ASCP\n\nEligibility: - Age \\>= 18 years\n- Histologically confirmed ASCP or high suspicion for ASCP based on histologic analysis\n- for squamous markers\n- Participants with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable disease and progression on at least 1 prior treatment regimen\n\nDesign: - This is a phase II single cohort clinical trial with one arm.\n- The number of evaluable participants needed for the primary endpoint is 25; maximum accrual set at 55 participants (accounting for screen failures and inevaluable participants).\n- iNITIALparticipants will receive Minnelide at 2 mg/day PO on Days 1-21 of a 28 day cycle.\n- Later participants will receive a higher dose of 2.5 mg/day PO on the same schedule.\n- Treatment will be continued for up to 12 cycles (1 year) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n- Treatment response will be assessed by imaging every 2 cycles (8 weeks).\n- Optional tumor biopsies will be requested mid-cycle 1 and at time of progression.\n- A disease control rate of \\>= 40% in this highly refractory population would constitute a positive study. Up to 12 participants will treated be initially. If 3 of the 12 participants have a response, then up to 13 additional participants will be entered to determine the true response rate. ### conditionsModule #### conditions\n- Adenosquamous Carcinoma of the Pancreas #### keywords\n- Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma\n- epigenetic changes\n- MYC\n- triptolide\n- HSP70 ### designModule\n**studyType**: INTERVENTIONAL #### phases\n- PHASE2",

ASCP will be defined as \\>=30% malignant squamous component in background of typical PDA. If malignant squamous component is identified in the sample, but the pathologist is unable to determine whether it is \\>= 30%, then the participant will be considered to have high suspicion for ASCP.\n\nNote: To meet this criteria, participant must be able to submit a suitable archival tumor specimen (primary or metastatic site) for review or currently have tumor in a location deemed low risk for core biopsy so that suitable tissue can be acquired for confirmation of diagnosis. Note that cytopathology specimens are not considered suitable for definitive diagnosis of ASCP but can be used to determine high suspicion for ASCP. - Participants with metastatic, recurrent or locally advanced unresectable disease and progression or intolerance to at least 1 prior systemic treatment regimen in the advanced disease setting.\n- Disease measurable by RECIST 1.1 criteria.\n- Progressive disease as evidenced by increasing tumor size on radiologic assessment, increasing serum tumor marker (on last 2 measurements taken at least 1 week apart), increasing ascites, and/or worsening tumor-related symptoms such as weight loss, pain, GI upset.\n- Age \\>18 years.\n- ECOG performance status \\<2 (Karnofsky \\>60%).\n- Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial.\n- Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  - absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\>= 1,500/microL\n  - platelets \\>= 100,000/microL\n  - hemoglobin \\>= 9.0 g/dL or \\>= 5.6 mmol/La\\-\n  - Creatinine \\<= 1.5 x ULN\n\nOR\n\nmeasured or calculated \\-bcreatinine clearance (GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl) \\>= 45 mL/min for participant with creatinine levels \\>1.5 x institutional ULN - total bilirubin \\<= 1.5 x ULN OR direct bilirubin \\<= ULN for participants with total bilirubin levels \\>1.5 x ULN\n- AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) \\<= 2.5 x ULN (\\<= 5 x ULN for participants with liver metastases)\n- International normalized ratio (INR) OR\n\n  - prothrombin time (PT)\n  - activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT):\n\n\\<= 1.5 x ULN unless participant is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants\n\nALT (SGPT) = alanine aminotransferase (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase); AST (SGOT) = aspartate aminotransferase (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase); GFR = glomerular filtration rate; ULN=upper limit of normal.\n\n\\-a Criteria must be met without erythropoietin dependency and without packed red blood cell (pRBC)\n\ntransfusion within last 2 weeks.\n\n\\-b Creatinine clearance (CrCl) should be calculated per institutional standard.\n\nNote: This table includes eligibility-defining laboratory value requirements for treatment; laboratory value requirements should be adapted according to local regulations and guidelines for the administration of specific chemotherapies.\n\n-The effects of Minnelide on the developing human fetus are unknown.
