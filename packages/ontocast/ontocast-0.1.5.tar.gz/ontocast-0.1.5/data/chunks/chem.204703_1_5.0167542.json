Several studies estimated that coherent coupling is localized to a small fraction of nanocrystals ( 10 -7 -10 -3 ) within the assembly, raising questions about the origins of localization and ways to overcome it. In this work, we examine singleexcitation superradiance by calculating radiative decays and the distribution of superradiant wave function in two-dimensional CsPbBr3 nanocube superlattices. The calculations reveal that the energy disorder caused by size distribution and large interparticle separations reduces radiative coupling and leads to the excitation localization, with the energy disorder being the dominant factor. The single-excitation model clearly predicts that, in the pursuit of cooperative effects, having identical nanocubes in the superlattice is more important than achieving a perfect spatial order. The monolayers of large CsPbBr3 nanocubes (LNC = 10-20 nm) are proposed as model systems for experimental tests of superradiance under conditions of non-negligible size dispersion, while small nanocubes (LNC = 5-10 nm) are preferred for realizing the Dicke state under ideal conditions. - \u00a9 2023 Author(s).

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe optical properties of self-assembled colloidal nanocrystals are of fundamental and practical interest. The reports of superfluorescence 1-6 and superradiance 7-9 in ordered assemblies (superlattices) of perovskite nanocrystals are recent examples of collective optical effects. Combining such phenomena with scalable self-assembly 10 may lead to the low-cost fabrication of miniature coherent light sources for photonics and optical information processing. These systems form a rich playground where the material properties of constituent nanocrystals and the superstructure could be designed to control the cooperative light emission.\n\nconditions. 13,14 Semiconductor nanocrystals, resembling 'artificial atoms,' are interesting as quantum emitters with facile tunability of emission frequency by changing nanocrystals' size or composition. Nonetheless, their assemblies feature numerous inhomogeneities. For example, a realistic batch of colloidal nanocrystals is characterized by a distribution of sizes, shapes, and different surface passivations. 15 A nanocrystal superlattice also contains further imperfections such as vacancies, 16 variation in the superlattice periodicity, 17 and strain. 18 These experimental realities make nanocrystal emitters distinguishable from each other and introduce energy disorder to the system.\n\nThe idealized cooperative light emission (e.g., superradiance 11 and superfluorescence 12 ) relies on identical emitters that are coupled via the electromagnetic field and form a Dicke ladder of macroscopic states. Molecular and atomic gases have been historically used as experimental systems that can approach such ideal\n\nThe imperfections pose a general question of how the energetic and spatial disorder influence the macroscopic coherence and cooperative light emission.",
        "Localization is one consequence of disorder that emerges from the recent experiments on perovskite nanocrystal superlattices. For example, Rain\u00f2 et al. proposed the existence of superfluorescent domains within superlattices with an\n\nestimated average number of coherently coupled CsPbBr3 nanocrystals N coupled = 28, 1 Blach et al. estimated N coupled = 3. 8 More recently, Adl et al. measured a radiative enhancement factor in the range 1.2-11.0 for an estimated N coupled = 1000-40 000 CsPbBr3 nanocrystals in similar superlattices. 9 Given that a single superlattice typically contains N = 10 -10 6 7 nanocrystals, the yield of cooperativity is low and requires an explanation.\n\nThe CsPbBr3 superlattices with N = 10-10 4 nanocrystals have been studied theoretically using a single-excitation model of superradiance. 19,20 These studies focused on the dependence of the superradiant rate enhancement on the total number of nanocrystals, center-to-center distance, aspect ratio (nanocubes vs nanoplatelets), a static energy disorder and the dimension of the superlattice (1D, 2D, 3D). Among the theoretical findings are predictions that arrays of smaller nanocubes are more resistant to thermal decoherence than arrays of larger nanocubes, and the emergence of cooperative robustness against decoherence in large 3D superlattices ( N &gt; 10 3 ) . Considering the intense research interest in this topic, it is valuable to continue the systematic investigation of nanocrystal superlattice design parameters across different regimes of superradiance, particularly from weak to strong disorder, and in the Dicke limit or away from it.\n\nIn this work, we theoretically examine the effects of nanocube size, interparticle separation, energy and spatial disorder on the superradiance and on the spatial localization of the superradiant wave function in a 2D superlattice. We consider the enhancement of superradiance across different regimes of disorder, finding that optimizing the superradiance demands differing strategies of tuning nanocrystal parameters. ## II. THEORETICAL MODEL\n\nLet us consider the general case of a superlattice consisting of Nx Ny , and Nz nanocrystals along x, y and z axes respectively ( N = NxNyNz ) . Each nanocrystal is assumed to be a cube with an edge length LNC and is covered with a homogeneous ligand shell of thickness Lshell. In the single-excitation regime, the system can be described by using the tight-binding Hamiltonian H rad . 19,21\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThe above Hamiltonian is applicable to both 3D and 2D superlattices, the latter by setting Nz = 1.\n\nThe first term in Eq. (1) describes a system of N uncoupled nanocrystals. The corresponding matrix consists of the 3 \u00d7 3 diagonal blocks in the basis of bright triplet states denoted by \u2223 \u03b1 \u27e9 . The complex diagonal term is\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere h \u03c9 0 is the energy of bright exciton (without fine structure splitting) and \u03b3 r is the radiative recombination rate of an exciton in a single nanocrystal.\n\nThe off-diagonal second term in Eq. (1)\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\noriginates from the radiative coupling between the nanocrystals in the superlattice. 19,21 The real and imaginary parts of J mn are given as\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn the above, j i / y i denotes the spherical Bessel function of the first/second kind of order i . Dmn \u03b1\u03b2 = \u02c6 e \u03b1 \u22c5 \u02c6 e \u03b2 -3 \u02c6 ( e \u03b1 \u22c5 \u02c6 rmn )( \u02c6 e \u03b2 \u22c5 \u02c6 rmn ) , \u02c6 e \u03b1 is the unit vector in the \u03b1 direction, \u02c6 rmn = \u20d7 rmn / rmn and \u20d7 rmn is the position vector connecting the centers of the m th and n th nanocrystals. The resonant wave number k 0 = \u03c9 0 \u221a \u03b5 opt / c in which \u03b5 opt is the optical dielectric constant of the material in the relevant frequency range.\n\nThe eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Hamiltonian H rad can be obtained by diagonalizing of the corresponding 3 N \u00d7 3 N matrix. The superradiant state is defined to be the eigenstate \u03a8 SR of H rad with the smallest (i.e. the most negative) imaginary part \u0393 SR, which is defined as the superradiant radiative decay rate. Here we take into account only the radiative coupling and radiative recombination of excitons in the nanocrystals. Other recombination or energy transfer channels, for instance electron-phonon coupling or Auger-type processes, play the role of decoherence sources and are not considered in the current model.\n\nThe results presented in this manuscript focus on the described model applied to nanocubes with LNC ranging from 5.0 to 20.0 nm, which are sizes representative of the CsPbBr3 nanocubes spanning various confinement regimes and that have been synthesized with high uniformity, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and form close-packed assemblies in previous publications (see Refs. 22 and 23 for an overview). ## III. RESULTS ## A. Radiative enhancement in superlattice\n\nWe begin by examining the effects of the superlattice morphology and the nanocube size on the acceleration of the radiative decay of the superradiant state. Two superlattice morphologies of experimental relevance to CsPbBr3 nanocubes are considered: a symmetric 2D monolayer Nx \u00d7 Ny where Nx = Ny , and Nz = 1 [Fig. 1(a)] 27-29 and a symmetric 3D superlattice consisting of Nx \u00d7 Ny \u00d7 Nz nanocubes, Nx = Ny = Nz . 1-6,30\n\nFor a total number of nanocubes N , the superradiant enhancement is defined as the ratio \u0393 SR / \u03b3 r between \u0393 SR of the superlattice and the radiative rate of a single nanocrystal \u03b3 r . The calculated \u0393 SR / \u03b3 r for 2D and 3D superlattice morphologies, each with LNC = 5.0, 13.0 and 20.0 nm, are presented in Figs. 1(b)-1(d). The shell length was set to Lshell = 1.5 nm, a value typical of cesium oleate and oleylammonium bromide ligands used in the preparation of superfluorescent assemblies. For most nanocrystals of interest, many-body perturbation theory provides a reasonable description of the dependence of \u03c9 0 and \u03b3 r on LNC. 24 More quantitative calculations of \u03c9 0 and \u03b3 r\n\nFIG. 1.

For the range of nanocrystal sizes considered here, the nanocrystal energy h \u03c9 0 varies from 2.32 to 2.52 eV, while the radiative decay times \u03b3 -1 r varies from 0.1 to 0.9 ns, respectively, based on the calculations from these works. 24,25 More details can be found in Table I.\n\nIn panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 1, we defined the superlattice size factor \u03a6 = d / \u03bb , where d = Nx (LNC + 2Lshell ) is the length of the superlattice, which is the distance covered by nanocubes along x direction, and \u03bb = 2 \u03c0 c / \u03c9 0 \u221a \u03b5 opt is the resonant wavelength of the bright exciton. In other words, the dimensionless size factor \u03a6 characterizes the relative size of the superlattice to the resonant wavelength. In the calculations, we consider superlattices containing a total number of nanocubes ranging from N = 4 to N = 50 2 for 2D and N = 25 3 for 3D case, which spans the Dicke limit ( \u03a6 \u226a ) 1 to the short wavelength limit ( \u03a6 \u226b ) 1 . In the following, we note main observations from the results presented in Fig. 1.\n\nFirst, similar trends in superradiant enhancement are observed between 2D and 3D superlattices [Figs. 1(c) and 1(d)]. Not only the 2D calculations still capture the key features of the structure-property relation with minuscule computation cost but also they permit a more transparent presentation of the wave functions (Fig. 4) for the discussion of superradiance localization in the later sections. Hence, we will focus on the results for 2D superlattices.\n\nSecond, the increase in the radiative enhancement, which grows approximately as \u223c N for a small number of nanocubes, shows a sub-linear behavior in N for larger superlattices. 19 This sub-linear behavior can be explained by the fact that the radiative coupling, Eqs. (4) and (5), attenuates for nanocubes that are further apart in a large superlattice. The increase is accompanied by shallow dips at the values indicated by the dashed lines in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d). In Ref. 31, similar dips were seen in dilute superradiant lattices where the interparticle spacing was comparable to the wavelength, and explained by geometric resonances when the lattice constant approaches certain critical values.\n\nThird, for a fixed number N of nanocubes, a system with smaller LNC exhibits stronger enhancement, i.e. larger \u0393 SR / \u03b3 r . This is particularly noticeable in the limit of small nanocube size, where the number of nanocubes that can be coupled within a region of size \u223c \u03bb scales with their 2D packing density ( LNC + 2Lshell ) -2 . The optical transition energy h \u03c9 0 (hence \u03bb ) is weakly size-dependent for the range of LNC studied here. Therefore, the smaller LNC (or smaller \u03a6 ) implies a stronger radiative coupling leading to larger \u0393 SR / \u03b3 r . 19\n\nNext, we systematically study the effect of shell length Lshell on the superradiant enhancement (Fig. 2). Two sizes of nanocubes LNC = 5.0 and 20.0 nm, and five different shell lengths Lshell = 1.0, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0, and 80.0 nm were considered. The large Lshell resembles the situation of diluted 2D superlattice where the nanocrystal number density per unit volume is significantly reduced. Generally, as the Lshell increases, the superradiant enhancement is reduced to the point that, at large Lshell values, the superradiance enhancement is virtually independent of LNC (e.g., L shell = 40.0 and 80.0 nm, green squares, and orange triangles in Fig. 2, respectively).\n\nAs expected, a larger Lshell leads to a larger center-to-center distance between nanocubes. The larger distance weakens the radiative coupling [Eqs. (3)-(5)] and lowers the superradiant enhancement. Intriguingly, the effect of increasing Lshell onto the superradiant wave function is not intuitive.\n\nThe color plots in Fig. 4 show the total norm of the superradiant wave functions, obtained by summing over norms of the x, y, and z components of the 3 N complex eigenvector, at each site of the Nx \u00d7 Ny superlattice. For the case where Lshell = 1.0 nm and LNC = 5.0 nm, the superradiant wave function spreads out and delocalizes over the entire superlattice, resulting\n\nFIG. 2. Superradiant enhancement \u0393 SR / \u03b3 r vs the size factor \u03a6 for two sizes, (a) LNC = 5.0 nm and (b) LNC = 20.0 nm for various shell lengths L shell = 1.0, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0 and 80.0 nm. Generally, as the shell length increases, the enhancement \u0393 SR / \u03b3 r decreases. For large Lshell , the effect of the nanocrystal size becomes less important.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin the largest \u0393 SR / \u03b3 r . The biggest nanocubes, LNC = 20.0 nm, with the same Lshell = 1.0 nm, exhibit the delocalization of \u03a8 SR to a lesser extent, resulting in reduced \u0393 SR / \u03b3 r (see Fig. 2 for comparison). For a large Lshell = 40.0 nm, the N - particle wave function \u03a8 SR fragments into several 'pockets' of superradiance [Figs. 4(c) and 4(d)] for both LNC sizes. The unexpected superradiance localization in a perfect superlattice is attributed to the weakened radiative coupling. To overcome the localization, strategies for enhancing radiative coupling are needed. For example, introducing a cavity may help overcome the delocalization through Purcell enhancement. 32 ## B. Effect of energy disorder\n\nIn this subsection, we consider the role of static energy disorder stemming from the size dispersion of nanocubes prepared by chemical syntheses. We note that there are other contributions, such as different surface passivation, shape variation, and dynamic disorder, to the energy dispersion, even at low temperatures. 15 Our choice to investigate the dependence of \u0393 SR / \u03b3 0 on \u03b4 L and \u03b4 E is based on the assumption that size dispersion captures the essence of static disorder in colloidal nanocrystals.\n\nFor an ensemble of average size LNC, the size dispersion is characterized by the dimensionless quantity \u03b4 L = \u03b4 LNC/LNC where \u03b4 LNC is the standard deviation in the size distribution. In this paper, we use the same method based on power series expansion as in the supplementary material of Ref. 26 to estimate the \u03b4 L - dependent energy width \u03b4 E for inhomogeneous broadening. To capture the effect of this energetic variation among the nanocubes, we introduce an additional term \u0394 En that follows the Gaussian distribution\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\napplied to the diagonal energy En in Eq. (2).\n\nIt is customary to use batches of colloidal nanocrystals with a narrow size distribution ( \u03b4 L of 10% or less) to produce well-ordered superlattices. 33,34 The reported average sizes for CsPbBr3 nanocubes characterized with electron microscopy yield \u03b4 LNC in the range of 0.5-1 nm for LNC = 5-20 nm. 35,36 This is equivalent to a variation of \u03b4 L in the range from 5 to 10%. Therefore, we study the effect of the\n\nFIG. 3. Radiative enhancement \u0393 SR / \u03b3 r vs the size factor \u03a6 with only energy disorder [panels (a)-(c), \u03b4 r = 0] and some random variation in the positions of NC centers [panel (d)]. (a) LNC = 5.0 nm, (b) LNC = 13.0 nm, (c) LNC = 20.0 nm, (d) L NC = 5.0 nm without ( \u03b4 E = 0, filled symbols) and with ( \u03b4 E \u2260 0, empty symbols) energy disorder. For each size, the values of the energy width \u03b4 E for each value of \u03b4 L can be found in Table I. Shell length L shell = 1.0 nm in all calculations. Energy disorder \u03b4 E is characterized by size dispersion \u03b4 L (dimensionless). Spatial randomness has Gaussian distribution of width \u03b4 r .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstatic energy disorder on the superradiant enhancement \u0393 SR / \u03b3 r for various \u03b4 L as shown in Figs. 3(a)-3(c) and 5.\n\nFor all nanocube sizes LNC, the energy disorder clearly diminishes the superradiant enhancement. Generally, in a more polydispersed sample, the larger energy variation among the constituent nanocubes significantly reduces the effect of the coupling defined in Eq. (3) of the total Hamiltonian. Hence, the eigenstates, especially the superradiant solution, in Eq. (1) are pushed towards those of an uncoupled system. For superlattices made of smaller nanocubes, the same size dispersion \u03b4 L results in a larger energy width \u03b4 E and, thus, more dramatic reduction in radiative enhancement compared to larger nanocubes. Notably, for the case of LNC = 5.0 nm in Fig. 3(a), a level of size dispersion around 5% ( \u03b4 E = 27.5 meV) is sufficient to quench the cooperative effect. On the other hand, for LNC = 20.0 nm, a part of the cooperative enhancement at \u03b4 L = 15% ( \u03b4 E = 1.5 meV) is still retained in the superradiant state.\n\nThe influence of size dispersion on superradiance can be understood and visualized from the perspective of wave function distribution over the superlattice. Panels (e) and (f) of Fig. 4 show, in the case with energy disorder determined by \u03b4 L = 10%, the total norm of the wave functions \u03a8 SR of superlattices made of nanocubes with LNC = 5.0 nm [panel (e)] and LNC = 20.0 nm [panel (f)]. We note an important observation from a quick comparison with the case without energy disorder ( \u03b4 L = 0% implying \u03b4 E = 0) in panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 4: the static energy disorder alters the localization property of the N - nanocube wave function from being delocalized over the superlattice to being localized on several nanocubes. The localization of the superradiant wave function gets stronger with the bigger value of energy width \u03b4 E , making smaller nanocubes more susceptible to the effects of disorder than larger nanocubes.\n\nFIG. 4. Distribution of superradiant wave functions over the 2D superlattice for LNC = 5.0 nm (left panels) and LNC = 20.0 nm (right panels). For each size, three cases are covered: no energy disorder [panels (a)-(b)], i.e. \u03b4 L = 0 and Lshell = 1.0 nm, \u03b4 L = 0 and large distance between NCs where Lshell = 40.0 nm [panels (c)-(d)] and with energy disordered derived from size dispersion \u03b4 L = 10% and Lshell = 1.0 nm [panels (e)-(f)]. Large nanocrystal separation leads to the formation of smaller pockets of superradiance. Large static energy disorder results in the destruction of cooperative behaviour due to localization of the wave function.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe effect of energy disorder saturates past a certain point, with disorder greater than \u03b4 L = 10%-15% showing similar emission characteristics in our simulations. Even in this limit, when energy disorder is large enough to cause large reductions in the superradiance rate, emission rates are still expected to increase with the superlattice size factor \u03a6 , as seen in Figs. 3(a)-3(c), albeit at a slower rate than in a perfect superlattice with \u03b4 L = 0. This is surprising because cooperative superradiance is destroyed by localization in this limit [Figs. 4(e) and 4(f)]. Instead, increasing the superlattice size factor in the presence of strong disorder increases the probability of the formation of local regions of strong emission, arising from the concerted local fluctuation of the diagonal energies En . That explains the cooperative robustness to disorder reported by Ghonge et al. 20 ## C. Effect of spatial displacement\n\nSo far, only the effect of static energy disorder has been considered, while the center-to-center distance LNC + 2Lshell between the adjacent nanocubes remains identical. However, the random size distribution also affects the particle arrangement within a superlattice and displaces the centers of nanocubes out of their perfect positions. X-ray diffraction studies of CsPbBr3 nanocube superlattices point out small, \u223c 1 \u00c5, fluctuations in center-to-center distances between nanocubes, suggesting the 'structural coherence' could be a factor underlying the emergence of collective optical properties. 37,38 To simulate the effect of spatial displacement of nanocubes relative to each other in the superlattice, the position vector \u20d7 rmn , from the center of the m th to the center of the n th nanocube, is replaced by\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere \u0394 \u20d7 rmn is a random vector belonging to a Gaussian distribution of width \u03b4 r , and \u03b4 r is the dimensionless quantity that characterizes the degree of displacement [similar to Eq. (6)].\n\nFigure 3(d) shows the results of \u0393 SR / \u03b3 r for the case of superlattices with \u03b4 r = 0, \u03b4 E = 0 (filled purple diamonds), with only random displacement \u03b4 r = 10% and no energy disorder \u03b4 E = 0 (filled green circles), with random displacement and energy disorder, \u03b4 r = \u03b4 L = 5% (empty red triangles) and \u03b4 r = \u03b4 L = 10% (empty green squares). The choice \u03b4 r = \u03b4 L is motivated by the fact that the spatial displacement is due to the size dispersion. Without energy disorder, some slight reduction is observed in the radiative enhancement due to the randomness in nanocube-to-nanocube distance \u02dc \u20d7 rmn . Nonetheless, the most significant impact of size dispersion on the superradiant enhancement \u0393 SR / \u03b3 r occurs through the energy disorder [Eq. (6)] and not through the imperfect spatial arrangement of nanocubes, especially in superlattices made of nanocubes in strong or intermediate confinement regime. ## IV. DISCUSSION\n\nThe above results have uncovered competing effects of the nanocube size LNC onto superradiant enhancement \u0393 SR / \u03b3 r . On the one hand, superradiance from small nanocubes is enhanced due to the higher packing density and shorter center-to-center distances (Figs. 1 and 2). On the other hand, small nanocubes are susceptible to energy disorder and show strongly suppressed superradiance (Fig. 4). For instance, the large value of \u03b4 E for the case of LNC = 5.0 nm leads to an almost complete quenching of \u0393 SR / \u03b3 r and the localization of the wave function \u03a8 SR onto a few nanocube sites (Anderson localization). 8,39-41 The degree of localization is controlled by the energy width \u03b4 E [Figs. 4(e) and 4(f)] and manifests the order-disorder transition in a nanocrystal superlattice. These results suggest a possible explanation for minuscule values of N coupled in recent experiments. 7,8\n\nTo illustrate the point and showcase the immediate utility of the model for interpreting experimental results, we extracted experimental parameters from Refs. 7 and 8 and ran the calculations. In the first case, using LNC = 9.0 nm, Lshell = 1.5 nm, and an energy width \u03b4 E = 7.8 meV, 8 we obtained, from the radiative Hamitonian, the enhancement factors ranging from 4.7 to 6.5 for 3D superlattices with N = 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 to 12 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 12. The calculated enhancement is higher than the reported factor of 2.7, and the difference is reconcilable by a slightly higher \u03b4 E . In the second case, for 2D superlattices with N = 40 \u00d7 40 and LNC = 3.8 nm, an enhancement factor of 1.9 in the superradiant decay rate was\n\nFIG. 5. Radiative enhancement \u0393 SR / \u03b3 r (color map) vs the size L NC of nanocubes and size dispersion \u03b4 L /energy width \u03b4 E for 5 \u00d7 5 superlattices [panels (a), (c)] and 15 \u00d7 15 superlattices [panels (b), (d)]. The result in each panel is an average over 48 realizations of energy disorder. The dot size was scaled linearly with the value of \u0393 SR / \u03b3 r . Note the reversed trend of the radiative enhancement vs L NC as the size dispersion moves away from \u03b4 L = 0.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncalculated when the ligand length Lshell was changed from 1.5 nm (oleylammonium bromide, experimental \u03b4 E = 32.3 meV) to 0.35 nm (sodium bromide, \u03b4 E = 24.2 meV), which is close to the experimental ratio of 1.5 between the fast-components of the decay rates. 7\n\nHowtocounteract the punishing effect of energy disorder? One strategy is to increase the LNC hence reducing the impact of size dispersion \u03b4 L . Figure 5 maps the radiative enhancement \u0393 SR / \u03b3 r as a function of \u03b4 L (upper panels) or \u03b4 E (lower panels) for Nx \u00d7 Ny = 5 \u00d7 5 ( \u03a6 \u226a 1, the Dicke regime) and 15 \u00d7 15 superlattices. The strategy for maintaining superradiance in the face of large \u03b4 L is to shift to the upper part of the map (albeit with a modest \u0393 SR / \u03b3 r = 5-20), in other words, use larger nanocubes (LNC = 10-20 nm). Under near-perfect conditions, the smaller nanocubes (LNC = 5-10 nm) are clearly preferred as they deliver the largest radiative enhancement of \u0393 SR / \u03b3 r = 20-120.\n\nThe employed theoretical model is rooted in molecular aggregates 21 and it is instructive to compare the described effects of disorder in nanocubes with molecules. Fidder et al. computed the effects of Gaussian distribution of transition energies ( \u03b4 E , diagonal disorder) and inter-molecular distances (off-diagonal disorder) on superradiance for a linear molecular aggregate in \u03a6 \u226a 1 regime. 42 Since size distribution is not a concern for molecules, the \u03b4 E was set as a fraction of dipole-dipole interaction energy between neighbours. Both types of disorder were found to result in excitation localization to the ends of the chain. However, the quenching of radiative enhancement was found to be more sensitive to the off-diagonal disorder rather than the diagonal disorder, with one reason being the formation of strongly-interacting dimers. Jang and Silbey found that both types of disorder matter for excitation localization in a model of a molecular ring of light-harvesting complex 2, 43 with either one capable of dominating localization depending on their magnitude and correlation. In contrast to detrimental effect of disorder in identical emitters, Moix et al. considered a model of Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex with a built-in energy transfer (a biased system), finding that diagonal disorder enhances delocalization. 44 The brief comparison with molecular aggregates indicates that the effects of the disorder on radiative enhancement and localization are not axiomatic and depend on the specific emitter configuration and properties of the system.Continuing to adapt various scenarios from molecular aggregates to nanocrystal superlattices offers exciting avenues for future research.\n\nNext, it is important to revisit several fundamental assumptions of the theoretical model. The Hamiltonian defined Eq. (1) is applicable in the ideal case where all dipoles are aligned, i.e. in-phase, and isotropic where the x, y and z components of the optical dipoles have the same oscillator strength.",
        "Including the phase decoherence between the optical dipoles or the anisotropy of the optical dipole may be essential to understand more comprehensively the superradiant behaviour. 45 So far, only the single-excitation regime has been considered. 19-21 At high excitation intensities, the formation of multiple excitons is likely, 46,47 in which the single-excitation Hamiltonian is no longer valid. In this case, a new framework to describe the system beyond single excitation remains to be developed for nanocrystal superlattices.\n\nFinally, it is valuable to put the results in the context of the available superlattices and CsPbBr3 nanocubes, and discuss the feasibility of future experiments. Current literature suggests a few viable methods for producing 2D superlattices. For example, irregular finitesized monolayers of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals have been made by solvent evaporation 27 and extended 2D monolayers ( \u03a6 \u226b ) 1 of closepacked CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (LNC = 10-15 nm) were achieved by solvent vapor annealing. 28 In a demonstration of control over lateral dimensions of 2D superlattices, Cohen et al. fabricated sub-micron ( \u03a6 \u2265 1 ) islands of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with LNC = 9.7 \u00b1 2.1 nm by electrohydrodynamic inkjet printing. 29 The latest generations of small colloidal CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with LNC = 5 nm ( \u03b4 L = 7.5%) 48 and large ones with LNC = 19.8 \u00b1 1.7 nm 49 have been reported as high-quality single photon emitters and are feasible building blocks for superradiant assemblies. However, the reported size distributions need to be substantially reduced to avoid localization, as suggested by our model.\n\nFrom a spectroscopic point of view, the 10 -to 10 4 -fold acceleration of radiative decay suggests superradiance timescales in the range from tens of femtoseconds (fs) to tens of picoseconds (ps) (using 200-400 ps radiative lifetimes of CsPbBr3 nanocubes near 4 K 50-53 ). In the lower limit (i.e. tens of fs), the timescale of superradiance becomes comparable to that of the exciton formation. 54 In the intermediate range (1-2 ps), superradiance is comparable to the carrier cooling (0.3-0.7 ps in 8 nm CsPbBr3 nanocubes at room temperature) 55 and the polaron formation (0.8 ps in a single crystal CsPbBr3 at room temperature). 56 Given the typical duration of ultrashort laser pulses (10-100 fs), detecting superradiance requires femtosecond spectroscopies such as transient absorption or multidimensional spectroscopies. On the higher end of the range (tens of ps), the superradiance falls within the time resolution of state-of-theart commercial streak cameras and could be probed by time-resolved photoluminescence. 1-3,6 ## V. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented a systematic theoretical investigation of the superradiant Hamiltonian for 2D nanocrystal superlattices and argued that they are feasible testbeds of collective phenomena. Although the focus of the study is on the lead halide perovskite nanocubes, the model can be easily adapted to study nanoscale emitters of other materials. The results presented here are in agreement with the earlier works of Mattiotti et al. and Ghonge et al. , who studied superradiance and its suppression by energy disorder and thermal decoherence using the same model. 19,20\n\nThe reported calculations provided valuable insights into the non-trivial dependence of superradiance on experimentally relevant parameters such as LNC, Lshell, \u03b4 E , and \u03b4 r , their role and interplay in excitation localization. The results clearly show that, in pursuing cooperative effects, having as identical nanocubes as possible in the superlattice is more important than achieving a perfect spatial order. And if perfect nanocubes are not possible, larger imperfect nanocubes are preferred over smaller ones. These predictions await experimental verifications and we are optimistic about the possibility of such tests given the interest in these materials and superradiance phenomena. ## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nL.Z.T. was supported by the Molecular Foundry, a DOE Office of Science User Facility supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.
