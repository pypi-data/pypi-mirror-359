Summary of Signi fi cant Accounting Policies## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated fi nancial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim fi nancial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 28, 2024 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated fi nancial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fi scal year ended January 28, 2024, as fi led with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of results of operations and fi nancial position, have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated fi nancial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fi scal year ended January 28, 2024.\n\nIn May 2024, we announced a ten-for-one stock split, or the Stock Split, of our issued common stock, which was e ff ected through the fi ling of an amendment to the Company's Restated Certi fi cate of Incorporation, or the Amendment, with the Secretary   of   the   State   of   Delaware.   In   June   2024,   the   Company fi led   the   Amendment   to   e ff ect   the   Stock   Split   and proportionately increased the number of shares of the Company's authorized common stock from 8.0 billion to 80.0 billion.",
        "Shareholders of record at the close of market on June 6, 2024 received nine additional shares of common stock, distributed after the close of market on June 7, 2024. All share, equity award and per share amounts presented herein have been retrospectively adjusted to re fl ect the Stock Split. ## Signi fi cant Accounting Policies\n\nThere have been no material changes to our signi fi cant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Signi fi cant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fi scal year ended January 28, 2024. ## Fiscal Year\n\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2025 and 2024 are both 52-week years. The third quarters of fi scal years 2025 and 2024 were both 13-week quarters. ## Principles of Consolidation\n\nOur condensed consolidated fi nancial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. ## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of fi nancial   statements   in   conformity   with   U.S.   GAAP   requires   management   to   make   estimates   and assumptions that a ff ect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the fi nancial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could di ff er materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to   accounts   receivable,   cash   equivalents   and   marketable   securities,   goodwill,   income   taxes,   inventories   and   product purchase commitments, investigation and settlement costs, litigation, other contingencies, property, plant, and equipment, revenue recognition, and stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on historical facts and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.",
        "## Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements ## Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn  November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued a new accounting standard requiring disclosures of signi fi cant expenses in operating segments. We expect to adopt this standard in our fi scal year 2025 annual report. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which includes new and updated income tax disclosures, including disaggregation of rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. We expect to adopt this standard in our fi scal year 2026 annual report. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn   November   2024,   the   FASB   issued   a   new   accounting   standard   requiring   disclosures   of   certain   additional   expense information on an annual and interim basis, including, among other items, the amounts of purchases of inventory,\n\n9 ## NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n(Unaudited) ## NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nemployee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included within each income statement expense caption, as applicable.

Short-term and variable lease expenses for the third quarter and fi rst nine months of fi scal years 2025 and 2024 were not signi fi cant.\n\nOther information related to leases was as follows:\n\nNine Months Ended\n\n|                                                                   | Oct 27, 2024   | Oct 29, 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                                                   | (In millions)  | (In millions)  |\n| Supplemental cash fl ows information                              |                |                |\n| Operating cash fl ow used for operating leases                    | $ 227          | $ 200          |\n| Operating lease assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations | $ 679          | $ 439          |\n\nAs of October 27, 2024, our operating leases have a weighted average remaining lease term of 6.5 years and a weighted average discount rate of 4.15%. As of January 28, 2024, our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 6.1 years and a weighted average discount rate of 3.76%. ## Note 3 - Stock-Based Compensation\n\nStock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, that are based on our corporate fi nancial performance targets, market-based PSUs that are performance stock units based on our performance compared to market performance, and the employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP.\n\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts capitalized into inventory and subsequently recognized to cost of revenue, as follows: ## NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n(Unaudited) ## Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nNine Months Ended\n\n|                                   | Oct 27, 2024   | Oct 29, 2023   | Oct 27, 2024   | Oct 29, 2023   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                   | (In millions)  | (In millions)  | (In millions)  | (In millions)  |\n| Cost of revenue                   | $ 50           | $ 38           | $ 125          | $ 96           |\n| Research and development          | 910            | 701            | 2,469          | 1,826          |\n| Sales, general and administrative | 292            | 240            | 822            | 633            |\n| Total                             | $ 1,252        | $ 979          | $ 3,416        | $ 2,555        | ## Equity Award Activity\n\nThe following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans:\n\n|                            | RSUs, PSUs, and Market-based PSUs Outstanding                                                          | RSUs, PSUs, and Market-based PSUs Outstanding                                                          | RSUs, PSUs, and Market-based PSUs Outstanding                                                          |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                            | Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per Share (In millions, except per share data) | Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per Share (In millions, except per share data) | Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per Share (In millions, except per share data) |\n| Balance as of Jan 28, 2024 | 367                                                                                                    | $                                                                                                      | 24.59                                                                                                  |\n| Granted                    | 84                                                                                                     | $                                                                                                      | 84.70                                                                                                  |\n| Vested                     | (135)                                                                                                  | $                                                                                                      | 23.03                                                                                                  |\n| Canceled and forfeited     | (8)                                                                                                    | $                                                                                                      | 31.23                                                                                                  |\n| Balance as of Oct 27, 2024 | 308                                                                                                    | $                                                                                                      | 41.45                                                                                                  |\n\nAs of October 27, 2024, aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense was $12.4 billion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.3 years for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, and one year for ESPP. ## Note 4 -

        "## Note 5 - Income Taxes\n\nIncome tax expense was $3.0 billion and $1.3 billion for the third quarter , and $8.0 billion and $2.2 billion for the fi rst nine months, of fi scal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. The income tax expense as a percentage of income before income\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/00010458.. ## NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n(Unaudited) ## Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n\ntax was 13.5% and 12.2% for the third quarter , and 13.6% and 11.3% for the fi rst nine months, of fi scal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n\nThe e ff ective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower percentage of tax bene fi ts from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction relative to the increase in income before income tax and a discrete bene fi t in fi scal year 2024 due to an IRS audit resolution.\n\nE ff ective tax rates for the fi rst nine months of fi scal years 2025 and 2024 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax bene fi ts from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based compensation, the U.S. federal research tax credit, and income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate.\n\nGiven our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in the near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could vary based on our assessment of all available information.\n\nWhile we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities. As of October 27, 2024, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for , on such tax positions will signi fi cantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. ## Note 6 - Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\n\nThe following is a summary of cash equivalents and marketable securities:\n\n|                                                                                          | Oct 27, 2024   | Oct 27, 2024    | Oct 27, 2024    | Oct 27, 2024         | Oct 27, 2024     | Oct 27, 2024          |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                                                          |                |                 |                 |                      | Reported as      | Reported as           |\n|                                                                                          | Amortized Cost | Unrealized Gain | Unrealized Loss | Estimated Fair Value | Cash Equivalents | Marketable Securities |\n|                                                                                          | (In millions)  | (In millions)   | (In millions)   | (In millions)        | (In millions)    | (In millions)         |\n| Debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury                                              | $ 14,629       | $ 72            | $ (12)          | $ 14,689             | $ 1,795          | $ 12,894              |\n| Corporate debt securities                                                                | 14,221         | 74              | (17)            | 14,278               | 1,154            | 13,124                |\n| Money market funds                                                                       | 5,147          | -               | -               | 5,147                | 5,147            | -                     |\n| Debt securities issued by U.S. government agencies                                       | 3,542          | 11              | (4)             | 3,549                | 759              | 2,790                 |\n| Certi fi cates of deposit                                                                | 142            | -               | -               | 142                  | 42               | 100                   |\n| Total debt securities with fair value adjustments recorded in other comprehensive income | 37,681         | 157             | (33)            | 37,805               | 8,897            | 28,908                |\n| Publicly-held equity securities (1)                                                      |                |                 |                 | 472                  | -                | 472                   |\n| Total                                                                                    | $ 37,681       | $ 157           | $ (33)          | $ 38,277             | $ 8,897          | $ 29,380              |\n\n(1) Fair value adjustments on publicly-held equity securities are recorded in net income.

Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassi fi ed to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ine ff ectiveness should occur.\n\nWe also entered into foreign currency forward contracts mitigating the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities. For our foreign currency contracts for assets and liabilities, the change in fair value of these nondesignated contracts was recorded in other income or expense and o ff sets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which was also recorded in other income or expense.\n\nThe table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency contracts outstanding:\n\n|                                 | Oct 27, 2024   | Jan 28, 2024   |\n|---------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                 | (In millions)  | (In millions)  |\n| Designated as cash fl ow hedges | $ 1,360        | $ 1,168        |\n| Non-designated hedges           | $ 728          | $ 597          |\n\nThe unrealized gains and losses or fair value of our foreign currency contracts were not signi fi cant as of October 27, 2024 and January 28, 2024.\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/00010458.. ## NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries ## Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited)\n\nAs of October 27, 2024, all designated foreign currency contracts mature within 18 months and any unrealized gains and losses were not signi fi cant.\n\nDuring the fi rst nine months of fi scal years 2025 and 2024, the impact of derivative fi nancial instruments designated for cash fl ow hedges was not signi fi cant and the instruments were determined to be highly e ff ective. ## Note 11 - Debt ## Long-Term Debt\n\nExpected\n\n|                                              | Remaining    | E ff ective Interest Rate   | Carrying Value at   | Carrying Value at   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                              | Term (years) |                             | Oct 27, 2024        | Jan 28, 2024        |\n|                                              |              |                             | (In millions)       | (In millions)       |\n| 0.584% Notes Due 2024 (1)                    | -            | 0.66%                       | $ -                 | $ 1,250             |\n| 3.20% Notes Due 2026                         | 1.9          | 3.31%                       | 1,000               | 1,000               |\n| 1.55% Notes Due 2028                         | 3.6          | 1.64%                       | 1,250               | 1,250               |\n| 2.85% Notes Due 2030                         | 5.4          | 2.93%                       | 1,500               | 1,500               |\n| 2.00% Notes Due 2031                         | 6.6          | 2.09%                       | 1,250               | 1,250               |\n| 3.50% Notes Due 2040                         | 15.4         | 3.54%                       | 1,000               | 1,000               |\n| 3.50% Notes Due 2050                         | 25.4         | 3.54%                       | 2,000               | 2,000               |\n| 3.70% Notes Due 2060                         | 35.4         | 3.73%                       | 500                 | 500                 |\n| Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs |              |                             | (38)                | (41)                |\n| Net carrying amount                          |              |                             | 8,462               | 9,709               |\n| Less short-term portion                      |              |                             | -                   | (1,250)             |\n| Total long-term portion                      |              |                             | $ 8,462             | $ 8,459             |\n\n(1) We repaid the 0.584% Notes Due 2024 in the second quarter of fi scal year 2025.\n\nOur notes are unsecured senior obligations.

We enter into agreements with contract manufacturers that allow them to procure inventory based upon our de fi ned criteria, and in certain instances, these agreements are cancellable, able to be rescheduled, or adjustable for our business needs prior to placing fi rm orders. Though, changes to these agreements may result in additional costs. Other non-inventory purchase obligations were $13.2 billion, including $11.3 billion of multi-year cloud service agreements.

The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plainti ff s also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plainti ff s sought class certi fi cation, an award of unspeci fi ed compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA's motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plainti ff s fi led an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel a ffi rmed in part and reversed in part the district court's dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in dismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA's petition for rehearing en banc of the Ninth Circuit panel's majority decision to reverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had fi led on October 10, 2023. On November 21, 2023, NVIDIA fi led a motion with the Ninth Circuit for a stay of the mandate pending NVIDIA's petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court's resolution of the matter. On December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA's motion to stay the mandate. NVIDIA fi led a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024.

The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain o ffi cers and directors of the Company for breach of fi duciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plainti ff s are seeking unspeci fi ed damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA's corporate governance and internal procedures.\n\nThe putative derivative actions initially fi led September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of the plainti ff s'   appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain o ffi cers and directors of the Company for breach of fi duciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plainti ff s seek unspeci fi ed damages and other relief, including disgorgement of pro fi ts from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspeci fi ed corporate governance measures.\n\nAnother putative derivative action was fi led on October 30, 2023 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned Horanic v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 2023-1096-KSJM). This lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain o ffi cers and directors of the Company for breach of fi duciary duty and insider trading based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plainti ff s seek unspeci fi ed damages and other relief, including disgorgement of pro fi ts from the sale of NVIDIA stock   and   reform   of   unspeci fi ed corporate governance measures. This derivative matter is stayed pending the fi nal resolution of In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. ## Accounting for Loss Contingencies\n\nAs of October 27, 2024, there are no accrued contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further , except as described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse e ff ect on our operating results, liquidity or fi nancial position. ## Note 13 - Shareholders' Equity",
        "## Capital Return Program\n\nWe repurchased 92 million and 83 million shares of our common stock for $11.1 billion and $3.7 billion during the third quarter, and 254 million and 159 million shares of our common stock for $26.2 billion and $7 billion during the fi rst nine months, of fi scal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. On August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an additional $50 billion to our share repurchase authorization, without expiration. As of October 27, 2024, we were authorized, subject to certain speci fi cations, to repurchase up to $46.4 billion of our common stock. Our share repurchase program aims to o ff set dilution from shares issued to employees while maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities.\n\nFrom October 28, 2024 through November 15, 2024, we repurchased 19 million shares for $2.7 billion pursuant to a preestablished trading plan.\n\nWe paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $245 million and $99 million during the third quarter, and $589 million and $296 million during the fi rst nine months, of fi scal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders. ## Note 14 - Segment Information\n\nOur Chief Executive O ffi cer is our chief operating decision maker , or CODM, and reviews fi nancial information presented on\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/00010458..\n\nan operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing fi nancial performance.\n\n20 ## NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n(Unaudited) ## Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n\nThe Compute &amp; Networking segment includes our Data Center accelerated computing platforms and arti fi cial intelligence, or AI, solutions and software; networking; automotive platforms and autonomous and electric vehicle solutions; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; and DGX Cloud computing services.\n\nThe Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; virtual GPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and Omniverse Enterprise software for building and operating 3D internet applications.",
        "Operating results by segment include costs or expenses directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged across our uni fi ed architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments.\n\nThe 'All Other' category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Compute &amp; Networking or Graphics for   purposes   of   making   operating   decisions   or   assessing fi nancial   performance.

Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fi elds. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scienti fi c computing, AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and 3D internet applications. Our two operating segments are \"Compute &amp; Networking\" and \"Graphics,\" as described in Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. ## Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges ## Demand and Supply\n\nRevenue growth in the third quarter of fi scal year 2025 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated computing and AI solutions. Demand for the Hopper architecture is strong and our H200 o ff ering grew signi fi cantly in the quarter . We completed a successful mask change for Blackwell, our next Data Center architecture, that improved production yields. Blackwell production shipments are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of fi scal year 2025 and will continue to ramp into fi scal year 2026. We will be shipping both Hopper and Blackwell systems in the fourth quarter of fi scal year 2025 and beyond. Both Hopper and Blackwell systems have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fi scal year 2026.\n\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels.   We   may   not   be   able   to   generate   signi fi cant revenue from them.",
        "Advancements in accelerated computing and generative AI models, along with the growth in model complexity and scale, have driven increased demand for our Data Center systems.\n\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand\n\nprojections. With these additions, we have also entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products. The increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain may create more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations   in   production   planning,   execution   and   logistics.   Our   expanding   product   portfolio   and   varying   component compatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory\n\n24\n\nprovisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines. ## Product Transitions and New Product Introductions\n\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. We may be in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization and Automotive products. The computing industry is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. We have introduced a new architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where we seek to complete a new computing architecture each year and we are providing a greater variety of Data Center o ff erings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product con fi gurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may create volatility in our revenue. The increased frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays. We incur signi fi cant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact our ability to develop other products or adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the frequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have managed prior product transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are di ffi cult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs. ## Global Trade\n\nIn August 2022, the U.S. government, or the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\n\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\n\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became e ff ective in our fourth quarter of fi scal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements were e ff ective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the o ffi cial rule). Our upcoming Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 will also be subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities and to China and Country Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel. To date, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. Additionally, we understand that partners and customers have also not received a license to ship these restricted products.\n\nWe expanded our Data Center product portfolio to o ff er new solutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. We ramped new products designed speci fi cally for China that do not require an export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China grew sequentially in the third quarter of fi scal year 2025. As a percentage of total Data Center revenue, it remains below levels seen prior to the imposition of export controls in October 2023. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all.\n\nOur competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in the long term, if there are further changes in the USG's export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and fi nancial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, e ff ectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East. In addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in China. For example, the USG is considering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers.\n\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia- Paci fi c region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative\n\n25\n\nmanufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' for a discussion of this potential impact. ## Macroeconomic Factors\n\nMacroeconomic factors, including in fl ation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints and global economic and geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While di ffi cult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic factors can also impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our investments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fl uctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors. ## Israel and Regional Con fl icts\n\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical con fl ict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our approximately 4,300 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our global supply chain for our networking products has not experienced any signi fi cant impact. A substantial number of our employees in the region have been called-up for active military duty in Israel. Some employees in Israel have been on active military duty for an extended period and may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. We have not experienced signi fi cant impact or expense to our business; however, if the con fl ict is further extended or expanded, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business. ## Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2025 Summary\n\nThree Months Ended\n\n|                              |                                        |                                        |                                        | Quarter-over- Quarter Change   | Year-over-Year   |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------|\n|                              | Oct 27, 2024                           | Jul 28, 2024                           | Oct 29, 2023                           |                                | Change           |\n|                              | ($ in millions, except per share data) | ($ in millions, except per share data) | ($ in millions, except per share data) |                                |                  |\n| Revenue                      | $ 35,082                               | $ 30,040                               | $ 18,120                               | 17 %                           | 94 %             |\n| Gross margin                 | 74.6 %                                 | 75.1 %                                 | 74.0 %                                 | (0.5) pts                      | 0.6 pts          |\n| Operating expenses           | $ 4,287                                | $ 3,932                                | $ 2,983                                | 9 %                            | 44 %             |\n| Operating income             | $ 21,869                               | $ 18,642                               | $ 10,417                               | 17 %                           | 110 %            |\n| Net income                   | $ 19,309                               | $ 16,599                               | $ 9,243                                | 16 %                           | 109 %            |\n| Net income per diluted share | $ 0.78                                 | $ 0.67                                 | $ 0.37                                 | 16 %                           | 111 %            |\n\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These platforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center , Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive.\n\nRevenue was $35.1 billion, up 94% from a year ago and up 17% sequentially.\n\nData Center revenue was up 112% from a year ago and up 17% sequentially. The strong year-on-year and sequential growth was driven by demand for our Hopper computing platform for training and inferencing of large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications. Cloud service providers represented approximately 50% of our Data Center revenue, and the remainder was represented by consumer internet and enterprise companies. Strong year-onyear growth was driven by all customer types from both compute and networking. Demand for the Hopper architecture is strong and our H200 o ff ering grew signi fi cantly in the quarter . Data Center compute revenue was $27.6 billion, up 132% from a year ago and up 22% sequentially. Networking revenue was $3.1 billion, up 20% from a year ago driven by Ethernet for AI, which includes Spectrum-X end-to-end ethernet platform. Areas of sequential revenue growth include In fi niBand and Ethernet switches, SmartNICs, and BlueField DPUs. Though networking revenue was sequentially down 15%, networking demand is strong and growing.\n\nGaming revenue was up 15% from a year ago and up 14% sequentially. These increases were driven by sales of our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs and game console SoCs. Professional Visualization revenue was up 17% from a year ago and up 7% sequentially. These increases were driven by the continued ramp of RTX GPU workstations based on our Ada architecture. Automotive revenue was up 72% from a year ago and up 30% sequentially. These increases were driven by our self-driving ## platforms.\n\nGross margin increased from a year ago due to a higher mix of Data Center revenue.",
        "Sequentially, gross margin decreased primarily driven by a mix shift from H100 systems to more complex and higher cost systems within Data Center.\n\n26\n\nOperating expenses were up 44% from a year ago and up 9% sequentially, driven by higher compensation and bene fi ts expenses due to employee growth and compensation increases. ## Financial Information by Business Segment and Geographic Data\n\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure regarding segment information. ## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nRefer to Part II, Item 7, \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fi scal year ended January 28, 2024.

Revenue from Data Center computing grew 133% year-on-year and 195% compared to the fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2024 driven by demand for our Hopper computing platform for training and inferencing of large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications. Networking was up 20% year-on-year and 90% compared to the fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2024 driven by Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes Spectrum-X end-to-end ethernet platform.\n\nGraphics revenue - The year over year increase in the third quarter and fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2025 was led by higher sales of our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs. Reportable segment operating income - The year over year increase in Compute &amp; Networking segment operating income in the third quarter and fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2025 was primarily driven by growth in data center revenue. The year over year increase in Graphics segment operating income in the third quarter of fi scal year 2025 was primarily driven by growth in revenue, partially o ff set by an increase of 52% in segment operating expense. The year over year increase in Graphics segment operating income in the fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2025 was primarily driven by growth in revenue.\n\nAll Other operating loss - The year over year increase in the third quarter and fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2025 was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense re fl ecting employee growth and compensation increases. ## Concentration of Revenue\n\nRevenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to indirect customers, such as enterprises and gamers in a di ff erent location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 58% and 65% of total revenue for the third quarter , and 55% and 62% of total revenue for the fi rst nine months, of fi scal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n\nWe  refer   to   customers   who   purchase   products   directly   from   NVIDIA   as   direct   customers,   such   as   add-in   board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and system integrators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and may use either internal resources or third-party system integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include cloud service providers, consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.\n\nSales to direct customers which represented 10% or more of total revenue, all of which were primarily attributable to the Compute &amp; Networking segment, are presented in the following table:\n\n|            | Three Months Ended Oct 27, 2024   | Nine Months Ended Oct 27, 2024   |\n|------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Customer A | 12 %                              | *                                |\n| Customer B | 12 %                              | 11 %                             |\n| Customer C | 12 %                              | 11 %                             |\n| Customer D | *                                 | 12 %                             |\n\n* Less than 10% of total revenue\n\nThe customer references of A-D above may represent di ff erent customers than those reported in a previous period.\n\nFor the third quarter and fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2025, an indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Customer C, is estimated to represent 10% or more of total\n\nrevenue, attributable to the Compute &amp; Networking segment.\n\n28\n\nIndirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product speci fi cations,   internal   sales   data   and   other   sources.   Actual   indirect   customer   revenue   may   di ff er   from   our estimates.\n\nWe have experienced periods where we receive a signi fi cant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue. ## Gross Pro fi t and Gross Margin\n\nGross pro fi t consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue.\n\nGross margins increased to 74.6% for the third quarter of fi scal year 2025 compared to 74.0% for the third quarter of fi scal year 2024, due to a higher mix of Data Center revenue. Gross margins increased to 75.8% for the fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2025 compared to 70.9% for the fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2024, primarily due to higher mix of Data Center revenue. Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $865 million and $2.2 billion for the third quarter and fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2025, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $106 million and $305 million for the third quarter and fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2025, respectively. The net e ff ect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.2% and 2.0% in the third quarter and fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2025, respectively.",
        "Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $681 million and $1.4 billion for the third quarter and fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2024, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $239 million and $372 million for the third quarter and fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2024, respectively. The net e ff ect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.4% and 2.6% in the third quarter and fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2024, respectively. ## Operating Expenses\n\n|                                            | Three Months Ended   | Three Months Ended   | Three Months Ended   | Three Months Ended   | Nine Months Ended   | Nine Months Ended   | Nine Months Ended   | Nine Months Ended   |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                            | Oct 27, 2024         | Oct 29, 2023         | $ Change             | % Change             | Oct 27, 2024        | Oct 29, 2023        | $ Change            | % Change            |\n|                                            | ($ in millions)      | ($ in millions)      | ($ in millions)      | ($ in millions)      | ($ in millions)     | ($ in millions)     | ($ in millions)     | ($ in millions)     |\n| Research and development expenses          | $ 3,390              | $ 2,294              | $ 1,096              | 48 %                 | $ 9,200             | $ 6,210             | $ 2,990             | 48 %                |\n| %of net revenue                            | 9.7 %                | 12.7 %               |                      |                      | 10.1 %              | 16.0 %              |                     |                     |\n| Sales, general and administrative expenses | 897                  | 689                  | 208                  | 30 %                 | 2,516               | 1,942               | 574                 | 30 %                |\n| %of net revenue                            | 2.6 %                | 3.8 %                |                      |                      | 2.8 %               | 5.0 %               |                     |                     |\n| Total operating expenses                   | $ 4,287              | $ 2,983              | $ 1,304              | 44 %                 | $ 11,716            | $ 8,152             | $ 3,564             | 44 %                |\n| %of net revenue                            | 12.3 %               | 16.5 %               |                      |                      | 12.9 %              | 21.0 %              |                     |                     |\n\nThe increases in research and development expenses for the third quarter and fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2025 were driven by a 29% and 32% increase in compensation and bene fi ts, including stock-based compensation, re fl ecting employee growth and compensation increases, a 107% and 113% increase in compute and infrastructure, and a 317% and 209% increase in engineering development costs for new product introductions, respectively.\n\nThe increases in sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter and fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2025 were primarily driven by compensation and bene fi ts, including stock-based compensation, re fl ecting employee growth and compensation increases. ##

The change in Other , net, compared to the third quarter and fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2024, was primarily driven by an increase in fair value of our privately-held and publicly-held equity securities. Refer to Note 6 and 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our investments in privately-held and publicly-held equity securities. ## Income Taxes\n\nIncome tax expense was $3.0 billion and $1.3 billion for the third quarter , and $8.0 billion and $2.2 billion for the fi rst nine months, of fi scal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. The income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 13.5% and 12.2% for the third quarter, and 13.6% and 11.3% for the fi rst nine months, of fi scal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n\nThe e ff ective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower percentage of tax bene fi ts from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction relative to the increase in income before income tax and a discrete bene fi t in fi scal year 2024 due to an IRS audit resolution.\n\nGiven our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in the near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could vary based on our assessment of all available information.\n\nRefer to Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. ## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nOct 27, 2024\n\nJan 28, 2024\n\n|                                                  | (In millions)   | (In millions)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                        | $ 9,107         | $ 7,280         |\n| Marketable securities                            | 29,380          | 18,704          |\n| Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities | $ 38,487        | $ 25,984        |\n\n|                                           | Nine Months Ended   | Nine Months Ended   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                           | Oct 27, 2024        | Oct 29, 2023        |\n|                                           | (In millions)       | (In millions)       |\n| Net cash provided by operating activities | $ 47,460            | $ 16,591            |\n| Net cash used in investing activities     | $ (13,223)          | $ (4,457)           |\n| Net cash used in fi nancing activities    | $ (32,410)          | $ (10,004)          |\n\nOur investment policy requires the purchase of high-rated fi xed income securities, the diversi fi cation of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.\n\n30\n\nCash provided by operating activities increased in the fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2025 compared to the fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2024 due to growth in revenue, partially o ff set by advanced payments on supply agreements. Our accounts receivable balance at the end of the fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2025 re fl ects the strong revenue growth, partially o ff set by $1.7 billion from customer payments received prior to the invoice due date.\n\nCash used in investing activities increased in the fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2025 compared to the fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2024, primarily driven by net purchases of marketable securities, and purchase of land, property and equipment.\n\nCash used in fi nancing activities increased in the fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2025 compared to the fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2024, mainly due to higher share repurchases and higher tax payments related to RSUs. ## Liquidity\n\nOur primary sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of October 27, 2024, we had $38.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that we have su ffi cient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and share repurchases. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can fi nance future capital requirements.\n\nOur marketable securities consist of publicly-held equity securities, debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and fi nancial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certi fi cates of deposit issued by highly rated fi nancial institutions. Our corporate debt securities are publicly traded. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\n\nExcept for approximately $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. as of October 27, 2024 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.\n\nPayment from customers, per our standard payment terms, is generally due shortly after delivery of products, availability of software licenses or commencement of services. ## Capital Return to Shareholders\n\nWe paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $245 million and $589 million during the third quarter and fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2025, respectively.\n\nOur cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.\n\nWe repurchased 92 million and 254 million shares of our common stock for $11.1 billion and $26.2 billion during the third quarter and fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2025, respectively. On August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an additional $50 billion to our share repurchase authorization, without expiration. As of October 27, 2024, we were authorized, subject to certain speci fi cations, to repurchase up to $46.4 billion of our common stock. Our share repurchase program aims to o ff set dilution from shares issued to employees while maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities. We plan to continue share repurchases this fi scal year .\n\nFrom October 28, 2024 through November 15, 2024, we repurchased 19 million shares for $2.7 billion pursuant to a preestablished trading plan.\n\nThe U.S. In fl ation Reduction Act of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made after December 31, 2022. The excise tax is included in our share repurchase cost and was not material for the third quarter and fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2025. ## Outstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program\n\nOur aggregate debt maturities as of October 27, 2024, by year payable, are as follows:\n\n|                                              | Oct 27, 2024 (In millions)   |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Due in one year                              | $ -                          |\n| Due in one to fi ve years                    | 2,250                        |\n| Due in fi ve to ten years                    | 2,750                        |\n| Due in greater than ten years                | 3,500                        |\n| Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs | (38)                         |\n| Net long-term carrying amount                | $ 8,462                      |\n\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of October 27, 2024, we had no commercial paper outstanding.\n\nRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion. ## Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations\n\nUnrecognized tax bene fi ts were $1.9 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $215 million recorded in noncurrent income tax payable as of October 27, 2024. We are unable to estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the e ff ective settlement of such tax positions. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n\nOther than the contractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fi scal year ended January 28, 2024. Refer to Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources' in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fi scal year ended January 28, 2024 for a description of our contractual obligations. For a description of our operating lease obligations, long-term debt, and purchase obligations, refer to Notes 2, 11, and 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, respectively.",
        "## Climate Change\n\nTo date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from sourcing renewable energy or climate-related business trends. ## Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThere has been no adoption of any new and recently issued accounting pronouncements. ## Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk ## Investment and Interest Rate Risk\n\nFinancial market risks related to investment and interest rate risk are described in Part II, Item 7A, 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk' in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fi scal year ended January 28, 2024. As of October 27, 2024, there have been no material changes to the fi nancial market risks described as of January 28, 2024. ## Foreign Exchange Rate Risk\n\nThe impact of foreign   currency   transactions   related   to   foreign   exchange   rate   risk   is   described   in   Part   II,   Item   7A, 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk' in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fi scal year ended January 28, 2024. As of October 27, 2024, there have been no material changes to the foreign exchange rate risks described as of January 28, 2024.\n\nnvda-20241027\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/00010458.. ## Item 4. Controls and Procedures ## Controls and Procedures ## Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nBased on their evaluation as of October 27, 2024, our management, including our Chief Executive O ffi cer and Chief Financial O ffi cer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as de fi ned in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) were e ff ective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we fi le or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods speci fi ed in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive O ffi cer and our Chief Financial O ffi cer , as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. ## Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes that occurred during the third quarter of fi scal year 2025 that have materially a ff ected, or are reasonably likely to materially a ff ect, our internal control over fi nancial reporting. In fi scal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system, which will update much of our existing core fi nancial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our fi nancial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially a ff ect our internal control over fi nancial reporting. ## Inherent Limitations on E ff ectiveness of Controls\n\nOur management, including our Chief Executive O ffi cer and Chief Financial O ffi cer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must re fl ect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the bene fi ts of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected. ## Part II.

Risk Factors\n\nOther than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fi scal year ended January 28, 2024 and Item 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fi scal quarters ended April 28, 2024 and July 28, 2024.\n\nPurchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fi scal year ended January 28, 2024, and Item 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fi scal quarters ended April 28, 2024 and July 28, 2024, and below. Any one of those risks could harm our business, fi nancial condition and results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, fi nancial condition, results of operations or reputation.\n\nLong manufacturing lead times and uncertain supply and component availability, combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately, has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\n\nWe use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer, component or capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, as we have experienced in the past, there could be a signi fi cant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and has signi fi cantly harmed our fi nancial results.\n\nWe build fi nished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long-term supply agreements and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure su ffi cient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the fi nished products are not available from third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on orders for certain supply may be extended. We have previously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scale their capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity, which may require additional deposits. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines. Both Hopper and Blackwell systems have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fi scal year 2026.\n\nMany additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers' future demand for our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including: - \u00b7 changes in product development cycles and time to market;\n- \u00b7 competing technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;\n- \u00b7 changes in business and economic conditions;\n- \u00b7 sudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues;\n- \u00b7 rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\n- \u00b7 the availability of su ffi cient data center capacity or energy for customers to procure;\n- \u00b7 new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products; - \u00b7 new or unexpected end-use cases;\n- \u00b7 increase in demand for competitive products;\n- \u00b7 business decisions made by third parties; - \u00b7 the demand for accelerated computing, AI-related cloud services, or large language models;\n- \u00b7 changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;\n- \u00b7 the demand for our products; or\n- \u00b7 government actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.\n\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand projections. With these additions, we have also entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products. The increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain may create more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations   in   production   planning,   execution   and   logistics.   Our   expanding   product   portfolio   and   varying   component compatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.   Our   customer   orders   and   longer-term   demand   estimates   may   change   or   may   not   be   correct,   as   we   have experienced in the past.\n\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. We may be in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization and Automotive products. The computing industry is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. We have introduced a new architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where we seek to complete a new computing architecture each year and we are providing a greater variety of Data Center o ff erings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product con fi gurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand. Quali fi cation time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can reduce or create volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for   any   reason,   our fi nancial  results   may   be   negatively   impacted.   The   increased   frequency   and   complexity   of   newly introduced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays. For example, our gross margins in the second quarter of fi scal year 2025 were negatively impacted by inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material.\n\nWe incur signi fi cant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact our ability to develop other products or adequately manage our supply chain cost.",
        "Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the frequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have managed prior product transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are di ffi cult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs. Our indirect customers purchase through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to accurately forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.\n\nIf we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain su ffi cient inventory to fi ll orders on a timely basis. If our contract manufacturers experience supply constraints, we may not be able to increase supply to meet customer demand in a timely manner, or at all. If we cannot procure su ffi cient supply to meet demand or otherwise fail to ful fi ll our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact.\n\nIf we overestimate our customers' future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to\n\ncontinue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers' increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. We have also written down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments and may have to do so in the future. These impacts would be ampli fi ed by our placement of any non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of our\n\n35\n\nhistorical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and fi nancial results.\n\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels.   We   may   not   be   able   to   generate   signi fi cant revenue from them. Advancements in accelerated computing and generative AI models, along with the growth in model complexity and scale, have driven increased demand for our Data Center systems. Because our products may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is di ffi cult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a signi fi cant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.\n\nThe use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum.  It   is   di ffi cult   for   us   to   estimate   with   any   reasonable   degree   of   precision   the   past   or   current   impact   of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased aftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized 'gray market,' which also makes demand forecasting di ffi cult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels. Additionally, we depend on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW. Failure by developers, customers, and other third parties to build,   enhance,   and   maintain   applications   that   leverage   our   platforms,   or   failure   by   third-party   content   providers   or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adversely a ff ect customer demand. ## Our operations could be a ff ected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other actions may adversely impact our business.\n\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, a ff ecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tari ff s; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy   requirements;   competition   and   antitrust;   advertising;   employment;   product   regulations;   cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fi nes, criminal sanctions against us, our o ffi cers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have\n\nalso received requests for information from regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and South Korea regarding our sales of GPUs and other NVIDIA products, our e ff orts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, and we expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Governments and\n\n36\n\nregulators are considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to develop frontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act was formally adopted in June 2024 and will be implemented in phases between now and 2030. The State of California, among other jurisdictions, is considering similar legislation. Restrictions under this and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of new systems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and fi nancial results.Revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tari ff s, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse e ff ect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments.",
        "Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Government actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tari ff s, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could a ff ect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce's U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally ful fi ll our contractual obligations and have a material adverse e ff ect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and fi nancial condition.\n\nFor example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fi scal   year   2023,   we   stopped   direct   sales   to   Russia   and   closed   business   operations   in   Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.\n\nThe increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service o ff erings.\n\nConcerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying, tuning, and deploying LLMs and other AI applications. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and fi nancial results.\n\nSuch restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI technologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue and fi nancial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our ability to export our technology, products,   or   services   even   though   competitors   may   not   be   subject   to   similar   restrictions,   creating   a   competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and fi nancial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair , or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business and fi nancial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and customers to provide services to their end customers, even outside China.\n\nExport controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China and for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our products, bene fi ting competitors that o ff er alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business. Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting our business and fi nancial results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges. Additional unilateral or multilateral\n\n37\n\ncontrols are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our sales and e ff orts to supply the China market and our ful fi llment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. If the regulators conclude that we have failed to ful fi ll such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to various penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and fi nancial condition.\n\nDuring the third quarter of fi scal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China's semiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop, produce and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and speci fi cally impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China. During the second quarter of fi scal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\n\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became e ff ective in our fourth quarter of fi scal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were e ff ective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the o ffi cial rule). Our upcoming Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 will also be subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities and to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5, excluding Israel. To date, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.",
        "Following these export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out of China and Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely a ff ect our research and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to o ff er new solutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer. However, the licensing process is timeconsuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is approved, it may impose burdensome conditions that we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG is evaluating license requests in a closed process that does not have clear standards or an opportunity for review. For example, the Noti fi ed Advanced Computing, or 'NAC,' process has not resulted in approvals for exports of products to customers in China. The license process for exports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions that are onerous, even for small-sized systems that are not able to train frontier AI models. The requirements have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and already have disadvantaged and may in the future disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products. Management of these new licenses and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes in the USG's export controls, including further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to signi fi cant customers or if we incur signi fi cant transition costs. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose not to ful fi ll. The licensing requirements may bene fi t certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support e ff orts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.\n\nGiven the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and fi nancial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our   inventory   of   such   products   and   may   be   unable   to   develop   replacement   products   not   subject   to   the   licensing requirements, e ff ectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets,\n\n38\n\nincluding the Middle East. For example, the USG has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign fi rms to create and o ff er as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain   countries,   and   may   impose   additional   conditions   such   as   requiring   chip   tracking   and   throttling mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs if certain events, including unauthorized system con fi guration, use, or location, are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a signi fi cant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In addition, as the performance of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export controls may have a greater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions to 'design-out' certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. fi rms, harming our business, market position, and fi nancial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls.\n\nIn addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in China. For example, the USG is considering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers. Additionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely a ff ect our Gaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely a ff ect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may also encourage customers to purchase from our China-based competitors, or impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours. As another example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses new standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per memory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If the Chinese government modi fi es or implements the Action Plan in a way that e ff ectively prevents us from being able to design products to meet the new standard, this may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center products and may have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and fi nancial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and fi nancial results.\n\nFinally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan, would negatively impact our business and fi nancial results. ## Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds ## Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n\nWe repurchased 92 million and 254 million shares of our common stock for $11.1 billion and $26.2 billion during the third quarter and fi rst nine months of fi scal year 2025, respectively.
