            "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nPancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal types of cancer. ASCP is a highly aggressive type of pancreatic cancer. It is very rare. Researchers want to see if a drug called Minnelide can be used to treat ASCP.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo see if Minnelide is an effective treatment for ASCP.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults ages 18 and older with ASCP whose cancer did not respond to previous treatments.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\nMedical history\n\nPhysical exam\n\nBlood and urine samples\n\nEvaluation of ability to do daily activities\n\nElectrocardiogram to test heart function\n\nBody and/or brain scans. For these, participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body. They may have a contrast agent injected into a vein.\n\nTumor sample. If one is not available, participants will have a tumor biopsy. The biopsy will be taken with a small needle put through the skin into the tumor.\n\nTreatment will be given in 28-day cycles, for up to 12 cycles. There is a 7-day resting period between cycles. Participants will take Minnelide by mouth every day for 21 days of each cycle. They will keep a medicine diary.\n\nParticipants will have at least 1 study visit every cycle. They will review their medicine diary. They will repeat some screening tests.\n\nParticipants may have optional tumor biopsies. Some participants may need to take birth control during the study and for up to 6 months after treatment.\n\nParticipants will have an end-of-treatment visit 4 weeks after they stop taking the study drug. They will repeat some screening tests.",
            "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* Adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas (ASCP) is a highly aggressive variant of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), the most common type of pancreas cancer.\n* ASCP is estimated to account for 0.5-4% of the 55,000 people who are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the U.S. each year, making it a very rare tumor type.\n* No prospective clinical trials specific to ASCP have ever been performed.\n* Preclinical data in ASCP models indicate that an activated superenhancer network drives epigenetic changes which cause the prognostically unfavorable squamous differentiation.\n* Genomic analysis of ASCP tumors identifies frequent amplification of MYC.\n* Minnelide is a small molecule anti-superenhancer drug that inhibits MYC.\n* The recommended dose of Minnelide has previously been established through clinical testing for other indications.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\n-To determine the single agent antitumor activity (disease control rate) of the anti-superenhancer agent Minnelide in participants with advanced, previously treated ASCP\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Age \\>= 18 years\n* Histologically confirmed ASCP or high suspicion for ASCP based on histologic analysis\n* for squamous markers\n* Participants with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable disease and progression on at least 1 prior treatment regimen\n\nDesign:\n\n* This is a phase II single cohort clinical trial with one arm.\n* The number of evaluable participants needed for the primary endpoint is 25; maximum accrual set at 55 participants (accounting for screen failures and inevaluable participants).\n* iNITIALparticipants will receive Minnelide at 2 mg/day PO on Days 1-21 of a 28 day cycle.\n* Later participants will receive a higher dose of 2.5 mg/day PO on the same schedule.\n* Treatment will be continued for up to 12 cycles (1 year) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n* Treatment response will be assessed by imaging every 2 cycles (8 weeks).\n* Optional tumor biopsies will be requested mid-cycle 1 and at time of progression.\n* A disease control rate of \\>= 40% in this highly refractory population would constitute a positive study. Up to 12 participants will treated be initially. If 3 of the 12 participants have a response, then up to 13 additional participants will be entered to determine the true response rate."

Participants with carcinomatous meningitis are excluded regardless of clinical stability.\n\n* Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the participant s participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n* Has known uncontrolled or poorly controlled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV is considered uncontrolled or poorly controlled if an HIV-infected individual is not taking highly active anti-retroviral therapy or has a detectable viral load within the previous 6 months.\n* Has active HBV or HCV or is currently under treatment for HBV or HCV. Active HBV or HCV does not include previously cleared HBV or HCV or successfully cured HBV or HCV through treatment\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of trial therapy.\n\nNote: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu-Mist (Registered Trademark)) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.\n\n-History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to Minnelide",
