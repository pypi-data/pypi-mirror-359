# 1.3.2 [03-07-2025]
- Porosity-permeability relationship: permporo_mult_ev
  - Introduce permporo_mult_ev, turn PORO_OP into MULT_OP, use harmonic mean for facial averaging of multiplier
- EoSDensity and EoSEnthalpy API changes:
  - Update darts-flash enthalpy call in EoSEnthalpy class: eos.H_PT() to eos.H() 
  - Add optional arguments to pass ions and lumped ions to EoSDensity and EoSEnthalpy constructors
- Contact mechanics generalization:
  - Fixed logic in displaced_fault model: call self.reservoir_depletion() anyway since it is needed to check hash for objects for example porosity remove 'self.unstr_discr', 'self.pm' from checking hash as they are not available at check hash stage fix hash comparison (it was not comparing hash of the current data)
  - added run_tests() to be able to run tests within a displaced_fault model, locally.
  - Code refactoring (continues [link](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/open-darts/-/merge_requests/188)):
     1. get_normal_to_bound_face, get_parametrized_fault_props, write_fault_props are moved to the base class
     2. code piece is put into a function 'init_fractures' of the base class
- New feauture: pass property array dictionaries directly to output_to_vtk()

# 1.3.0 [16-05-2025]
- Unify well controls:
  - A single C++ class well_control_iface class has been generalized to handle bhp and different rate controls (inj/prod) for all engines
  - An instance of well_control_iface is created for every ms_well object upon init_rate_parameters()
  - Well controls and constraints are accessed through setters, with the aid of the PhysicsBase.set_well_controls() method  
  - The set of WellControlOperators calculates BHP, BHT and each phase's volumetric, mass and molar rates
  - An enum of class well_control_iface specifies the control/constraint type: -1) BHP, 0) MOLAR_RATE, 1) MASS_RATE, 2) VOLUMETRIC_RATE, 3) ADVECTIVE_HEAT_RATE; default is BHP
  - API of set_well_controls(): control_type: well_control_iface.WellControlType, is_inj: bool, target: float, 
                                phase_name: str, inj_composition: list, inj_temp: float, is_control: bool
  - A WellInitOperator translates PT-based controls to the given state specification (PT, PH, ...)
- Unify set_initial_conditions():
  - 1) Uniform or array -> specify constant or array of values for each variable to self.physics.set_initial_conditions_from_array()
  - 2) Depth table -> specify depth table with depths and initial distributions of unknowns over depth to self.physics.set_initial_conditions_from_depth_table() 
  - DartsModel.set_uniform_conditions(): forces user to overload this method in Model() and set initial conditions according to 1) or 2)
  - PhysicsBase.set_initial_conditions_from_array() to set initial conditions uniformly/with array
  - PhysicsBase.set_initial_conditions_from_depth_table() to interpolate/calculate properties based on depth table
  - On the C++ level, there is an array initial_state that lives in the conn_mesh class, which is to be filled with the initial state of all the primary variables in PhysicsBase.set_initial_conditions_from_*()
  - The method set_initial_conditions() initializes the mesh for **RESERVOIR BLOCKS ONLY**. Well cell initialization is done inside the engine
- PhysicsBase class constructor contains StateSpecification enum to define state variables
  - Unifies P (isothermal), PT (pressure-temperature) and PH (pressure-enthalpy)
  - Compositional constructor contains state_spec variable rather than thermal (bool)
  - Geothermal is PH by default (as before)
  - All engines have a WellInitOperator to translate PT-based well controls to the given state specification
- DartsModel.output() class now contains all output related functions of open-DARTS. Please refer to this [example](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/open-darts/-/blob/main/tutorials/output_and_restart.py?ref_type=heads) as a reference.
  - The output folder is defined in DartsModel.set_output(output_folder=output) instead of in DartsModel.init()
  - The default name for save file 'solution.h5' is changed to 'reservoir_solution.h5' and now only contains reservoir blocks instead of the entire solution vector. 
  - DartsModel.output.output_properties()'s new default behavior is to return primary variables if the properties list is not defined. If defined, only the listed primary (states) and/or secondary (properties) variables are returned as a dictionary.
  - DartsModel.output.store_well_time_data() is added to store well time data. The reported well time data include BHP, BHT, phases molar rates, phases mass rates, phases volumetric rates, components molar rates, components mass rates, and phases heat 
  rates over time. The rates are reported for each perforation as well. Total rates for each well are reported in two different ways: summation of perforations rates and rates calculated at wellhead. New naming scheme of the new well time data is explained in [documentation](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/open-darts/-/blob/development/docs/technical_reference/well_time_data_guide.md?ref_type=heads).
  - DartsModel.output.plot_well_time_data() is added for saving the figures of well time data.
  - C++ rate calculations will be replaced in the near future with python based rate calculations in the DartsModel.output(). Currently, both are available. However, it is recomended that you start transitioning to the new python rates.
- Save data to *.hdf5 with compression and/or single precision in order to manage file size. 
- Evaluate properties from engine or saved data.
- New option: DartsModel.set_output(all_phase_props=True), creates an extensive list of phase properties in the DartsModel.physics. 
- Build system:
	- The GPU configuration is supported in cmake. [Details](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/open-darts/-/merge_requests/179)
	- C++ standard was changed to C++20. [Details](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/open-darts/-/merge_requests/182)

    - An optional timestep control by the variable change from the previous newton iteration [added](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/open-darts/-/merge_requests/197) with a new DataTS Python class grouping the simulation parameters 
- Fluxes storage in arrays. Turned off by default, can be enabled by a call `engine.enable_flux_output()`. [Changes](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/open-darts/-/merge_requests/155/diffs?commit_id=23fd4fdfb9cbcbce7f0f72e0874c83bccae0be73)

- Mesh processing for DFN model with the Python discretizer [optimized](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/open-darts/-/merge_requests/194).
- Breaking changes:\
	- For open-DARTS wheels installed from pip or gitlab pipelines running command was changed. This is neccessary to ensure the libstdc++ provided with open-DARTS is loaded first. This doesn't impact Windows runs. However, DARTS command line interface (CLI) can also be used on Windows. [Details](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/open-darts/-/merge_requests/182).\
	{- Before, python main.py -}\
	{+ Now, darts main.py +}
	- Physics (P, PT, PH):\

	{+ Compositional(..., state_spec=state_spec) +}
	- Initialization:\

    {+ self.physics.set_initial_conditions_from_array(mesh=self.reservoir.mesh, input_distribution=input_distribution) +}
	- Well controls:\

	The `inj_stream` is split into `inj_comp` and `inj_temp` for thermal models. The integer parameter `phase_index` was replaced with the string `phase_name` which is the same as specified in physics.
	To keep the consistency with the previous model, for Geothermal physics `VOLUMETRIC_RATE` should be used, and for Compositional MOLAR_RATE should be used. 
	Each of the different control types can also be uniformly applied to both Geothermal and Compositional models. 

	- Output (hdf5 and well rates):\

		{- Before: m.save_data_to_h5('solution') -}\
		{+ Now: m.output.save_data_to_h5('reservoir') +}
	- Timesteps: any model should have a `set_sim_params(...)` call after physics initialization and before `model.init()`, where a DataTS instance is created.

	{- Before, input states in the `DartsModel output_properties()` function were read from engine.X}\
	{+ Now, input states in the `DartsModel output_properties()` are read from a user specified time-step in 'solution.h5'}\
	{- Before, the properties_list in the `DartsModel output_properties()` function contained variable names and property names'}\
	{+ Now, the 'properties_list' contains only the property names}\

# 1.1.1 [15-03-2024]

# 1.1.0 [16-02-2024]
- Migrated to cmake build system [(See details)](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/open-darts/-/merge_requests/58). We kept the old Visual Studio projects, but they will be removed later.
- Well rates in SuperEngine ("Compositional") are defined in reservoir conditions now, the units are kmol/day
- VTK output unified for all the reservoir classes [(See details)](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/open-darts/-/merge_requests/79)

- Removed python exposures [(See details)](https://gitlab.com/open-darts/open-darts/-/merge_requests/74)
- Breaking changes:
    - The function `darts_model run_python()` is renamed to `run()`.
	- Changes in unstructured mesh processing. It is required to specify tags in mesh file for all control elements now  (matrix, fractures and optionally boundary faces). 
	- Changes in vtk output:\
	    {- Before: input properties were saved to the first timestep vtk file -}\
        {+ Now: input properties saved to the separate "mesh.vtk" file +}\
		{- Struct/CPG: DartsModel.export_vtk(file_name, local_cell_data, global_cell_data, vars_data_dtype, export_grid_data) -}\
		{- Unstruct: UnstructReservoir.output_to_vtk(output_directory, output_filename, property_data, ith_step) -}\
        {+ DartsModel.output_to_vtk(ith_step, output_directory, output_properties) +}
	- No need to call `super().set_physics(physics)`, `super().set_reservoir()` and `super().set_physics()` in user's model: \
	    {- reservoir = UnstructReservoir(...) -}\
		{- super().set_reservoir(reservoir)-}\
        {+ self.reservoir = UnstructReservoir(...) +}
	- Discretization moved from the reservoir constructor to `init_reservoir()` method, which is called in `DartsModel.init()`.
	Thus, reservoir.mesh is not available right after the self.reservoir initialization. If it is needed, one can call `self.reservoir.init_reservoir()`. For example:
	```python	
	self.reservoir = StrucReservoir(...)
	self.reservoir.init_reservoir()
	volume = np.array(reservoir.mesh.volume, copy=False)
	# set boundary volume
	m.init()
	```
	- Adding additional properties to the report changed. Examples:\
	{- from darts.physics.super.operator_evaluator import PropertyOperators -}\
	{- props = [('Brine saturation', 'sat', 1), ('Gas saturation', 'sat', 0)] -} \
	{- physics.add_property_operators(PropertyOperators(props, property_container)) -}\
	{+ property_container.output_props = {'Brine saturation': lambda: property_container.sat[1], 'Gas saturation': lambda: property_container.sat[0]} +}
	- `property_container` and `property_container` are now dictionaries with a key=region index. Examples:			  
	{- sat = self.physics.property_operators.property_container.compute_saturation_full(state) -}\
	{- properties = self.physics.vars + self.physics.property_operators.props_name -}\
	{+ sat = self.physics.property_containers[0].compute_saturation_full(state)  # 0 - is a region index +}\
	{+ properties = self.physics.vars + self.physics.property_operators[0].props_name +}
	- The engine object moved to physics (as before, in version 1.0.4):\
	{- m.engine -}\
    {+ m.physics.engine +}

	- Wells object moved to Reservoir :\
	{- m.wells -}\
    {+ m.reservoir.wells +}

		- Now:    physics = Geothermal(...); super().set_physics(physics)  
	- Reservoir initialization:

		- Now:    reservoir = StructReservoir(...); super().set_reservoir(reservoir)  
	- Added method set_wells to the DartsModel class (function with the same name in user's model should be renamed)  
		- Before: set_boundary_conditions() # well controls were here  
		- Now:	rename it to set_wells() and added return super().set_wells() in the end of this method  
	- The 'platform' parameter moved from the engine constructor to set_physics:  
		- Before: Geothermal(..., platform='gpu')  
		- Now:	Geothermal(...); super().set_physics(physics, platform='gpu')
