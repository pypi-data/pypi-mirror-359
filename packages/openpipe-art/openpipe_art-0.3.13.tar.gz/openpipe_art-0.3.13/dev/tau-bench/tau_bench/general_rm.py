Grading standards:
- A rollout that achieves its goal should always get a significantly higher score than a rollout that does not achieve its goal.
- A rollout that achieves its goal more efficiently (eg. by avoiding unproductive detours) should get a higher score than a rollout that achieves its goal less efficiently.
- If one rollout is only slightly better than another, the difference in scores should be small. If it is significantly better, the difference in scores should be large.
- You may give some partial credit for a rollout that makes progress towards the task but does not complete it.

For each rollout, you need to output the rollout index, the explanation of the score, and the score. The score should be between 0 and 1.
