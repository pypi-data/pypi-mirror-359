### Installing ART

The ART client can be installed into projects designed to run on any machine that runs python.

```bash
pip install openpipe-art
```

### Running the client and server locally

The ART server can be run locally on any machine with a GPU.

```python
from art import TrainableModel, gather_trajectory_groups
from art.local.backend import LocalBackend

backend = LocalBackend()

model = TrainableModel(
    model_name="deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b",
    model_type="deepseek",
)

await model.register(backend)

... the rest of your code ...
```

### Running the client locally and connecting to a remote server

The ART client can also be run locally and connected to a remote server, which ART will automatically provision for you.

```python
from art import TrainableModel, gather_trajectory_groups
from art.skypilot.backend import SkyPilotBackend

backend = SkyPilotBackend()

model = TrainableModel(
    model_name="deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b",
    model_type="deepseek",
)

await model.register(backend)

... the rest of your code ...
```
