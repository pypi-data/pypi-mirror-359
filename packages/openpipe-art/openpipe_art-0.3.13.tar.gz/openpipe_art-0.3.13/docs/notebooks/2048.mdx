This notebook shows how to train a Qwen 2.5 3B model to play 2048. It will demonstrate how to set up a multi-turn agent, how to train it, and how to evaluate it.

Completions will be logged to OpenPipe, and metrics will be logged to Weights & Biases.

You will learn how to construct an agentic environment, how to define a rollout, and how to run a training loop.
