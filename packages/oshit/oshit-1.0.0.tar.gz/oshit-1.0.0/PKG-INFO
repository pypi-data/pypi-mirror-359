# OSHit -- Get your hit of the Orange Site in the terminal

## Introduction

OSHit is a read-only terminal-based client for HackerNews. It provides the
ability to view all the top/recent items in the major categories, as well as
allowing viewing comments and user details. Where relevant, bindings are
always available to open the relevant view on HackerNews itself in your web
browser.

Please note that this client *isn't* designed to allow reading any and all
stories on HackerNews, it's about reading what's current "hot" or new,
within the categories provided by [their
API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

## Installing

### pipx

The package can be installed using [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):

```sh
$ pipx install oshit
```

### Homebrew

The package can be installed using Homebrew. Use the following commands to
install:

```sh
$ brew tap davep/homebrew
$ brew install oshit
```

## Running

Once installed run the `oshit` command.

## Main features

When run up the opening display is a list of items, the initial list being
the current top stories and jobs on HackerNews. Other lists available, via
shortcut keys or via tabs at the top of the screen, are "New", "Best",
"Ask", "Show" and "Jobs".

![The main index](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davep/oshit/main/images/oshit-index.png)

Pressing <kbd>u</kbd> when viewing a job or a comment will open a dialog
that shows the details of the user who posted the item.

When viewing a story or job and pressing <kbd>c</kbd> a dialog will open
that will let you view and navigate its comments.

## Tweaking

Because of the nature of the HackerNews API there might be a need for you to
dial in the ideal number of concurrent connections made to load up the data,
and also the timeout for the connections. As of the time of writing the
defaults are 50 concurrent connections and a timeout of 20 seconds.

If you run into problems press <kbd>F11</kbd> and tweak the maximum
concurrency and connection timeout values to taste (or look in
`~/.config/oshit/configuration.json` and change the `"maximum_concurrency"`
and `"connection_timeout"` values).

## Getting help

If you need help, or have any ideas, please feel free to [raise an
issue](https://github.com/davep/oshit/issues) or [start a
discussion](https://github.com/davep/oshit/discussions).

## TODO

Things I'm considering adding or addressing:

- [X] Chill out on item loading (see [#2](https://github.com/davep/oshit/issues/2))
- [ ] Add a configuration dialog for the connection value tweaks.
- [ ] Some degree of caching of items to reduce API hits.
- [ ] Expand the text-cleaning code to handle links, etc.
- [ ] Look at some "markup" of comments, eg: make quoted text more obvious.
- [ ] Add searching
  - [X] Amongst the current view
  - [ ] Amongst loaded comments within comment view
  - [ ] All of history ([`hn.algolia.com`](https://hn.algolia.com/api))
