**Para** was designed as a simple and modular backend framework for object persistence and retrieval. It helps you build applications faster by taking care of the backend. It works on three levels - objects are stored in a NoSQL data store or any old relational database, then automatically indexed by a search engine and finally, cached. This is the Python client for Para.
