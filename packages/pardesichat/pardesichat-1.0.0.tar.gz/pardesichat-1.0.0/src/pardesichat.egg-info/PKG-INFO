**Pardesi Chat 🤖🎮**

Welcome to Pardesi Chat, a project by Arsalan Pardesi.

This is a feature-rich, terminal-based chat application built with Python. It allows users on the same local network to connect and chat in real-time. More than just a chat app, it's a multi-game platform and a powerful AI assistant, all running locally in your terminal. The application intelligently detects if a server is running on the network; the first user to launch automatically becomes the host.

**✨ Features**

* Real-time LAN Chat: Instantly communicate with other users on your local network.
* Automatic Server Discovery: No need to configure IP addresses. The first person to start is the host, everyone else joins automatically.
* Private Messaging: Send direct messages to specific users with the /whisper command.
* Integrated Games:
	* 	Hangman: Challenge the room with a word and see who can guess it first!
	* 	Stick Figure Fighter: A turn-based, 1v1 fighting game with standard and special moves, rendered in ASCII art.

* On-Device AI Assistant:
	* Ask coding, general knowledge, or complex questions.
	* Provide a URL to an image and ask the AI to describe or analyze it.
	* Provide a URL to a news article or document and ask the AI to summarize it.

**📥 Installation & Usage (for Users)**

This application is packaged and available on PyPI. The recommended way to install it is using pip.

    Install the Package
    Open your terminal and run the following command:
    pip install pardesichat

Run the Application
Once installed, you can start the chat from any terminal window by simply typing:

    pardesi-chat


The first person to run the command on a network will become the server host. All subsequent users running the same command will join the chat. To exit, type exit and press Enter.

**🤖 One-Time AI Setup (For the Server Host)**

These steps are only for the user who will host the chat and wants to enable the AI features. Client users do not need to do this.

    Install Ollama
    
Download and install the Ollama application for your operating system from the official website: https://ollama.com. The pull command below will download it for you. 

Start the Ollama Service
Before starting the chat server, you must have the Ollama service running. 
    
    Open a separate, dedicated terminal window and run:
    
    ollama serve

Keep this terminal window running in the background.

Pull the Required AI Models
This application uses two different models: one for text/code and another for vision. Open another new terminal and pull both models. This is a one-time download.
