The provided files contain Python code related to managing scanning for dependencies and generating software bill of materials reports. 

### Inputs:
- The `ScanDepscan` class takes a dictionary of inputs in its constructor. The specific content of this dictionary is not detailed and may vary based on the class requirements.
- The `test_run` function in the test file does not directly take any inputs, but it creates a temporary package lock file for testing purposes.

### Outputs:
- The `ScanDepscan` class has a `run` method that executes the `depscan` tool to generate a software bill of materials report. It returns a dictionary containing the path to the generated report file.
- The `test_run` function in the test file executes the `run` method of the `ScanDepscan` class and verifies the existence and validity of the generated software bill of materials report.
- The main output of interest in this context is the path to the SBOM report file produced by the `ScanDepscan` class.

### Usage:
- The `ScanDepscan` class is designed to check for the presence of the `cdxgen` tool, install it if necessary, and then run the `depscan` tool to generate SBOM reports based on the specified inputs.
- The `test_run` function in the test file serves to validate the functionality of the `ScanDepscan` class by creating a mock environment, running the `ScanDepscan` class, and verifying the generated SBOM report.

The code is intended to be used in a larger system or workflow where scanning dependencies and generating SBOM reports are part of the development or security processes.
