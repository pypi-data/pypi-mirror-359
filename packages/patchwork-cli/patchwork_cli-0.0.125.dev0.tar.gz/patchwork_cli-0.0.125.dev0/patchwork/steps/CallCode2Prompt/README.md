The code provided includes three Python files within the path `patchwork/steps/CallCode2Prompt/`:
1. `__init__.py` - an empty file.
2. `CallCode2Prompt.py` - a class named `CallCode2Prompt` derived from `Step` class. It takes inputs, processes data related to code files, runs a command-line tool `code2prompt`, and creates a JSON file as output containing extracted data from code files.
3. `TestCallCode2Prompt.py` - a unit test file for the `CallCode2Prompt` class, ensuring the output is not empty after running the code for a given folder path.

### Inputs
- `folder_path`: Path to a folder containing code files for processing.

### Outputs
- `prompt_value_file`: Path to the JSON file with extracted data from code files.
- `code_file`: Same as `prompt_value_file`.

The `CallCode2Prompt` class is designed to be instantiated with input data related to code files, processed using the `run()` method, and provide extracted information in a JSON file as output.
