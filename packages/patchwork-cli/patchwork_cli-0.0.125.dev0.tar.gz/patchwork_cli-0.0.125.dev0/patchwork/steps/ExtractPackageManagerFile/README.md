# Extract Package Manager File

## Inputs

- **Package Manager File Extraction**:
    - Directory: Root directory of the project.
    - Package URL: The Package URL of the dependency.

## Outputs

- A list of paths to package manager files relevant to the PURL's type found in the specified directory.
- A dictionary containing paths to the generated prompt value and code files.
- Log messages during the extraction process.

### Description

This Python code consists of three files:
1. **__init__.py**: Empty file.
2. **ExtractPackageManagerFile.py**: Defines functions for extracting package manager files based on PackageURL types, transforming version strings to Semantic Versioning format, and extracting relevant data from SBOM VDR files.
3. **TestExtractPackageManagerFile.py**: Contains unit tests for the `ExtractPackageManagerFile` class.

The `ExtractPackageManagerFile` class initializes input parameters, validates required keys, and processes SBOM VDR data to extract component and vulnerability information. It associates PURLs with source file paths, identifies affected and unaffected versions, and compiles this data. It further saves the extracted data as a temporary JSON file and logs execution status.

The `run()` method of the `ExtractPackageManagerFile` class loads SBOM VDR data, maps PURLs to source files, processes vulnerabilities, reads source file contents, and compiles the data structure. It generates message updates, prepares update information, and saves data to a JSON file.

The test cases in `TestExtractPackageManagerFile.py` validate the proper functioning of the `ExtractPackageManagerFile` class by creating a temporary SBOM VDR file, executing the extraction process, and checking the generated JSON files for validity.
