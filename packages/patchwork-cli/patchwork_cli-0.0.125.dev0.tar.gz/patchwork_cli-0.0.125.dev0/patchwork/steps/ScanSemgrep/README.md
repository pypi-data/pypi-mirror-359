# Code Documentation

## Input
- This code is part of a software package called Patchwork and specifically deals with the `ScanSemgrep` step.
- The `ScanSemgrep` class has an `__init__` function that takes `inputs` as a dictionary, but it does not use this input in the provided code snippet.

## Output
- The `ScanSemgrep` class has a `run` function that executes the Semgrep tool to analyze Python code.
- It generates a SARIF-formatted file containing the scan results.
- The results are saved to a temporary file, and the path to this file is returned as a dictionary in the `run` function output.
- Logging information is provided at the start and end of the scan process.
