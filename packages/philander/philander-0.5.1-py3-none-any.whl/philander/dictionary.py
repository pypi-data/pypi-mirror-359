    """A dictionary is meant to translate keys to values, both of them being integers.
    
    For example, a certain configuration register content could be
    translated into its physical data domain by means of a dictionary. The BMA456
    acceleration sensor can adjust its measurement range to +/- 2g, 4g, 8g or
    even 16g by setting its ACC_RANGE register to either 0, 1, 2 or 3,
    respectively. Considering the register content to be the key domain, whereas
    the corresponding range limits are the values, a dictionary would translate
    as follows:
    
    ====    ========
    Key     Value
    ====    ========
    0       2000
    1       4000
    2       8000
    3       16000
    ====    ========
    
    It is also possible to translate vice-versa, i.e. from the value-domain into
    keys by finding the nearest matching key. The behavior of this search
    algorithm can be controlled by the dictionary's ``mode`` attribute.
    
    Note that at the advantage of runtime speed, this implementation assumes the
    dictionary be sorted by values in ascending order.
