## Context

<!-- Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using two to three sentences. You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question or give the technical story. What is the issue that is motivating this decision or change? How is the decision architecturally significant - warranting an ADR? What is the high level design Approach? Leave the details for the options section below! -->

Some of the (interface) methods return values or objects to be processed further by the caller. Further, the success or reason of failure for a method call is indicated by an error code. It would violate good programming practice to let the return value implicitly encode the success-or failure indicator, e.g. by using NULL values or "-1". Further, the specific reason of failure would even be impossible to encode.

For that reason, these methods must return both, the semantic return value or object and an error code.

In Python, returning two values can be achieved by the means of tuples. This decision is to clarify the order of elements in this tuple.

## Options <!-- optional -->

<!-- Give an austere description of the considered options. Concentrate on technical aspects. Give pros and cons, but do not argue, why this option was finally selected or not.
### Option A

[example | description | pointer to more information]

* Good, because [argument a]
* Good, because [argument b]
* Bad, because [argument c]
-->

As far as we can see, there are only two options: Will the error code be the first or the last element in this tuple?

### Option A

The error code is placed first, as in:

````return err, otherValue````

* Good, because the status of the method call can always be interpreted, even without knowing the method's exact return signature.
* Bad, because the error code must always be read or muted just to pick the interesting value (as in: ````_, val = foo(...)````

### Option B

The error code is placed last, as in:

````return otherValue, err````

* Good, because the caller gets the interesting value first
* Good, because currently, slightly more implementations use this scheme
* Bad, because for the correct interpretation, the error code is needed, anyway; Moreover, it must be interpreted, before even looking at the other return value(s).

## Considerations <!-- optional -->

<!-- Document decision drivers, forces, concerns, ancillary or related issues, questions that arose in debate of the ADR. Indicate if/how they were resolved or mollified.

* [driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, …]
* [driver 2, e.g., a force, facing concern, …]
-->
* Currently, the implementation is inconsistent in this point. So we have to modify some of the methods and test applications.

## Decision

<!-- What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing? Document any agreed upon important implementation detail, caveats, future considerations, remaining or deferred design issues. Document any part of the requirements not satisfied by the proposed design. 

Chosen option: "[option 1]", because [justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force force | … | comes out best (see below)].
-->

Chosen option: "Option B", in favor of the majority of code.

## Consequences

<!-- What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
* [e.g., improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required, …]
* [e.g., compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required, …]
* …
-->

We are aware of the following:
* We have to check the whole code, modify part of it and thoroughly test the result.
* In order to prevent from divergence, we have to stick to this decision, in the future.

## Related ADRs <!-- optional -->

<!-- List any relevant ADRs - such as a design decision for a sub-component of a feature, a design deprecated as a result of this design, etc..

* 2024-07-12 O. Maye: PROPOSED. ADR created and options A and B outlined.
* 2025-01-10 O. Maye: ACCEPTED. Decided for option B (data, err).
