    This may involve some sort of motor to execute mechanical work, such as in
    gears, drives or stimulators. However, also other physical media like
    electricity (taser) or light (laser) might be the functional basis of an
    actuator.
    
    An actuator is meant to reflect the most atomic component of a mechanical
    device. Several actuators may compose a more complex subsystem,

        or may not end automatically. In any case, the operation can be
        stopped intentionally by calling :meth:`stopOperation`.

        The optional ``direction`` parameter may be used to indicate the
        direction of the operation. Interpretation of left/right or
        positive/negative etc. is up to the implementation.
        
        The ``strengthIntensity`` parameter may be used to set the drive
        strength or intensity of a movement.
        The strength should be given in a meaningful physical unit.
        If meant as an intensity, it should be an integer percentage in
        the range [0...100].
        In the context of PWM control, this parameter may be interpreted
        as the voltage amplitude applied, expressed in milli Volt.
        This parameter is optional.
        
        The optional parameter ``onSpeedDuty`` may indicate the speed of
        the movement or the length of the ON phase in a rectangular
        control signal.
        If interpreted as a speed, it should be given either as a value
        in meters per second (m/s) or as an integer percentage related
        to some maximum possible or reference speed.
        When controlling a PWM device, this is the duty cycle expressed
        as a percentage.

        The ``ctrlInterval`` parameter gives the total length of a
        periodic control interval, e.g. for PWM control. It is expressed
        in milliseconds.
        This parameter is optional.
        
        The parameter ``durationLengthCycles`` is optional.
        It  and may be interpreted as a run time duration, preferably
        expressed as a number in milliseconds (ms).
        Alternatively, this parameter may also be interpreted as a way
        length for the actuator to go, preferably expressed as a number
        in millimeters (mm).
        Finally, this can also be the number of cycles to last, e.g.
        when controlling a PWM device. Then, this is a unitless integer
        number.
