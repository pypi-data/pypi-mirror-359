        This function will never block, but may read data that has been
        read before, already. More precisely, the data returned was
        valid / taken at a moment in the past, which is as close as
        possible to the current point in time, (including right NOW).
        
        For sensors which deliver measurements continuously in time,
        there is no semantic difference to :meth:`getNextData`.
        
        In contrast, for sensors, which provide measurements discretely
        at certain time intervals, this function is expected to deliver
        the last measurement point - without any waiting. Typically, this
        requires some kind of buffering. at the sensor or driver side.
        
        The method is synchronous in that, it hands out the resulting
        data to the caller upon return. In fact, this method returns both,
        the measurement result and an error code signaling success or
        failure. The measurement data should be considered
        valid only, if the error code indicates a successful execution
        of this method.
        
        The type and interpretation of the returned measurement data is
        specific to the individual sensor and driver implementation. The
        application may rely on values scaled to reasonable units, such
        as temperatures in degree Celsius, distances in meters and
        pressures in Pascal - or multiples and fractions thereof.
        
        Also see: :meth:`getNextData`.

        measurement interval to expire.
        
        This function may introduce a blocking wait, but always returns
        with fresh, new data never read before. The measurement is
        taken / valid either immediately or as early as possible in the
        future.
        
        For sensors, that deliver data continuously in time, there is no
        difference to :meth:`getLatestData`.
        
        For sensors that sample data at certain time intervals, this
        function very likely includes some waiting delay until the next
        measurement is due.
        
        In either case, this function blocks until the measurement is
        retrieved and hands out data to the application upon return.
        In that sense, this is a synchronous function.
        
        The return is twofold: the measurement result and an error code
        signaling success or failure. The measurement data should be
        considered valid only, if the error code indicates a successful
        execution of this method.
