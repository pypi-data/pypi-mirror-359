![Power Supply Manager](images/PowerSupplyManager.png)

Control multiple networked power supplies from the same graphical application. 

# Features

## üåê Remote Ethernet control

Connect to multiple bench-top power supply units over Ethernet (VXI11 or LXI protocols). Name each channel for easy identification.

![Overview](images/Overview.jpg)

## ‚ö° Four ways to control power output

* Individual channel control.
* Power all channels on/off simultaneously.
* Group any combination of channels to control simultaneously.
* Define power on/off sequences with configurable time delays in between.

## üó† Real-time voltage and current waveforms

View plots of the previous 10 minutes of voltage and current measurements for each channel.

## üéõÔ∏è Easy power supply channel controls

Set voltage, current, and 2/4-wire sense mode.

## üóíÔ∏è CSV logging and plotting

Log voltage and current measurements to CSV files. Plots are automatically generated from each CSV.

## üîÑ Store GUI configuration

Save and load multi-device configuration files to quickly restore settings.

## üí• [Advanced Mode] Latchup toolbar

* Automatically power cycle all active channels when a current limit is reached.
* Latchup Clear button automatically steps down channel voltage until latchup state is cleared and then returns to nominal voltage.
* Logs time and count of current limit events.

# Installation

## From pre-built executable (recommended)

1. Download Windows or Linux executable from [Releases](https://gitlab.com/d7406/power-supply-manager/-/releases) or [Package Registry](https://gitlab.com/d7406/power-supply-manager/-/packages/).
2. Copy the entire `PowerSupplyManager` directory from `dist` to the desired location on your system.
3. Run the executable.

## From PyPI

1. Install pip package:
  ```
  pip install power-supply-manager
  ```

  Make sure the pip installation directory is on your system PATH:
  * Linux / MacOS: Typically `$HOME/.local/bin`, `/usr/bin`, or `/usr/local/bin`
  * Windows: Typically `<Python install dir>\Scripts` or `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python<vers>\Scripts`

2. Run application:
  ```
  power-supply-manager
  ```

## From source
