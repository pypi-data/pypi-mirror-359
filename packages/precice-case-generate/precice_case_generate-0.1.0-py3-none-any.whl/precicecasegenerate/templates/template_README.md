# 🚀 Multiphysics Simulation Project

This `README.md` file was auto-generated by the `FileGenerator.py` script, providing a comprehensive guide to your coupled simulation.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project utilizes **preCICE** (Precise Code Interaction Coupling Environment) for a multiphysics simulation involving:

- **Participants**:
  {PARTICIPANTS_LIST}

- **Solvers**:
  {SOLVERS_LIST}

- **Coupling Strategy**:
  {COUPLING_STRATEGY}

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Before running the simulation, ensure you have the following installed:
- preCICE library
- {SOLVER1_NAME} solver
- {SOLVER2_NAME} solver
- Required dependencies for each solver

---

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Simulation

### Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to the `_generated` folder
cd _generated/

# Make the run script executable
chmod +x run.sh

# Execute the simulation
./run.sh
```

### Advanced Execution

For more control or debugging:
- Check `run.sh` for specific command-line arguments
- Modify solver-specific parameters in `adapter-config.json`

---

## 🔍 Simulation Configuration

- **preCICE Configuration**: `precice-config.xml`
  - Defines coupling interface and communication strategy
  - Modify with caution, refer to preCICE documentation

- **Adapter Configuration**: `{PARTICIPANT_NAME}/adapter-config.json`
  - Solver-specific coupling parameters
  - Adjust solver input/output mappings here

---

## 🧹 Cleaning Simulation Artifacts

```bash
# Make the clean script executable
chmod +x clean.sh

# Remove generated files and reset workspace
./clean.sh
```

**Warning**: This will remove all generated files except preserved ones.
