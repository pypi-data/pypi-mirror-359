#!/bin/bash
#
# run.sh Script
#
# This is a template. You need to implement it yourself.
#
# If you are trying to launch a Python script, you need to add:
#
# python path/to/file.py
#
# Example: https://github.com/precice/tutorials/blob/develop/flow-over-heated-plate/solid-dunefem/run.sh
#
# Note: In the example `run.sh` file, most setup steps (such as creating and activating a virtual environment
# or installing dependencies) have already been completed.
# Therefore, you may only need to add:
#
# python path/to/file.py
#

set -e  # Exit immediately if any command fails
