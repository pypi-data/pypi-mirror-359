# Sharing state

In the previous tutorial, we have seen how to compose a simple component from other components, how to render it, and detect user events. In this tutorial, we will see how to share state between components.

## Stores

Why is state management hard in web development? The dynamic nature of user interfaces means multiple components must reflect and react to shared and changing data without re-rendering everything anytime something changes (e.g, you recompute the whole app UI whenever a single state variable changes), or convoluted data flows (e.g., state being passed through many layers of components that donâ€™t even use it). Traditional approaches, like Redux, often introduce layers of boilerplate and require careful architecture when planning mutations on the app data.

There is another issue of immutability: we cannot mutate the state directly (e.g., `state.todos[0]["done"] = True`), since React, and thus Pret, relies on shallow comparison to detect changes in the state. For instance, if `todos` is the same object, even though its content has changed, React will consider that the state has not changed and will not trigger a re-render.

And if we take care of preventing direct mutations, changing the state can be cumbersome. For instance, if we want to change the `done` field of the first todo, we would have to do something like this:

```{ .python .no-exec }
new_todos = list(todos)
new_todos[0] = {**todos[0], "done": True}

# We now have todos != new_todos and
# todos[i] == new_todos[i] for all i except 0
```

Pret takes inspiration from [valtio](https://github.com/pmndrs/valtio/) and provides a simple way to manage state in your components. A store can be created and shared between components. Access to the store data and mutations are recorded, such that the app knows which component should be re-rendered when a given part of the state changes.

To create a store, we use the `create_store` wrapper:

```python
from pret import create_store
from pret.store import subscribe

store = create_store(
    {
        "todos": [
            {"text": "My first todo", "done": True},
            {"text": "My second todo", "done": False},
        ],
        "letters": ["a", "b"],
    }
)

subscribe(store, callback=lambda ops: print(ops))
store["todos"][1]["done"] = True
# Out: [('set', ['todos', 1, 'done'], True, False)]

del store["todos"][1]["done"]
# Out: [('delete', ['todos', 1, 'done'], None, True)]

store["todos"][1]["cool"] = True
# Out: [('set', ['todos', 1, 'cool'], True, None)]

store["letters"].append("c")
# Out: [('set', ['letters', 2], 'c', None)]

store["letters"][1] = "z"
# Out: [('set', ['letters', 1], 'z', None)]  # (1)!
```

1. In Python, we cannot access the replaced value (None below). However, it is accessible in transpiled Python code (ie when the method is called from a @component function)

!!! warning "Supported types"

    At the moment, not all types can be used in a Pret store. We focus on supporting the most common container types, such as lists and dictionaries, in addition to the basic types (int, float, str, bool, None).

## Using stores in components

Now that we have a store object, we can use it in our components. To let Pret know that a component should re-render when a part of the state changes, we use the `use_store_snapshot` hook, which returns a snapshot of the state. This hook tracks access made on the state, and if a mutation on a part of the state that was accessed is detected :

- the component will re-render
- the snapshot will be different from the previous one (meaning, we don't have the `new_todos is todos` issue mentioned earlier)

```python { .render-with-pret }
from pret import component, use_store_snapshot, create_store
from pret.ui.joy import Checkbox, Stack

store = create_store({
    "todos": [
        {"text": "My first todo", "done": True},
        {"text": "My second todo", "done": False},
    ],
})


@component
def TodoList():  # (1)!
    todos = use_store_snapshot(store["todos"])

    def on_change(event, i):
        store["todos"][i]["done"] = event.target.checked

    return Stack(
        [
            Checkbox(
                label=todo["text"],
                checked=todo["done"],
                on_change=lambda event, i=i: on_change(event, i),
            )
            for i, todo in enumerate(todos)
        ],
        spacing=2,
    )


TodoList()
```

1. Note that we don't pass the `todos` as an argument to the `TodoList` component anymore. Instead, we use the `use_store_snapshot` hook to directly subscribe to the global `store` object.


## Sharing state between components

Sharing state between components is now straightforward.
Let's display the number of remaining todos in the list. We will
use the same `store` object as the component above.

```python { .render-with-pret }
from pret.ui.joy import Typography
from pret.ui.react import br

@component
def RemainingTodoCounter():
    todos = use_store_snapshot(store["todos"])
    num_remaining = sum(not todo["done"] for todo in todos)

    return Typography(
        f"Number of unfinished todos: {num_remaining}.",
        br(),
        "Click todos in the previous component to change the count.",
    )

RemainingTodoCounter()
```
