# Proteus Actuarial Library

An actuarial stochastic modeling library in python.

**Note**
This library is still in development!

## Introduction

The Proteus Actuarial Library (PAL) is a fast, lightweight framework for building simulation-based actuarial and financial models. It handles complex statistical dependencies using copulas while providing simple, intuitive syntax.

**Key Features:**
- Built on NumPy/SciPy for performance
- Optional GPU acceleration with CuPy
- Automatic dependency tracking between variables
- Comprehensive statistical distributions
- Clean, Pythonic API

## Quick Start

```python
from pal import distributions, copulas

# Create stochastic variables
losses = distributions.Gamma(alpha=2.5, beta=2).generate()
expenses = distributions.LogNormal(mu=1, sigma=0.5).generate()

# Apply statistical dependencies
copulas.GumbelCopula(alpha=1.2, n=2).apply([losses, expenses])

# Variables are now correlated
total = losses + expenses
```

## Installation

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install proteus-actuarial-library

# With GPU support
pip install proteus-actuarial-library[gpu]
```

- [Examples](examples/) - Example scripts showing how to use the library

## Project Status

PAL is currently a proof of concept. There are a limited number of supported distributions and reinsurance contracts. We are working on:

* Adding more distributions and loss generation types
* Making it easier to work with multi-dimensional variables
* Adding support for Catastrophe loss generation
* Adding support for more reinsurance contract types (Surplus, Stop Loss etc)
* Stratified sampling and Quasi-Monte Carlo methods
* Reporting dashboards
