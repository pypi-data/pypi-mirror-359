# puzzlegen - Procedural Match-3 Puzzle Generator 
Developed by Caroline DAKOURE

Github Repository: https://github.com/carodak/puzzlegen/
PyPi Project: https://pypi.org/project/puzzlegen/

## Overview

`puzzlegen` is a Python package for generating, visualizing, and solving procedural Match-3 puzzles.
It allows you to create single puzzles or batches, visualize them, and automatically find solutions using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) solver.

## Features

- **Random puzzle generation** with customizable grid size, colors, and block counts
- **Automatic solver** (BFS) to check puzzle solvability within a given number of moves
- **Batch generation**: create and filter many puzzles at once
- **Visualization**: display puzzles and solutions as images or PDFs
- **Export**: save puzzles and solutions as PDF or CSV

## Installation

```bash
pip install puzzlegen
```
Or, if you want to install from the github repository that may contain more up-to-date versions:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/carodak/puzzlegen.git
```
Or, if you want to clone and install locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/carodak/puzzlegen.git
cd puzzlegen
pip install .
```

## Basic Usage

### Example 1: Randomly generate and solve a single puzzle
```bash
from puzzlegen.frontend import SinglePuzzle

# 1. Create a puzzle game
puzzle = SinglePuzzle(nb_blocks=10, colors=['red', 'blue', 'gray'], nb_moves=5, grid_size=(12, 12))

# 2. Generate a random puzzle
puzzle.generate()

# 3. Display the puzzle
puzzle.show()

# 4. Attempt to solve the puzzle (i.e., find a solution within nb_moves)
solution = puzzle.solve()

# 5. Save the solution and batch as files
puzzle.show_solution()
```

### Example 2: Generate a batch of solvable puzzles
```bash
from puzzlegen.frontend import PuzzleBatch

# 1. Create a batch of puzzles
batch = PuzzleBatch(
    blocks_range=(6, 10),
    colors_range=(2, 4),
    colors_blocks=['blue', 'red', 'gray'],
    nb_moves=5,
    grid_size=(12, 6),
    stack_probability=0.75
)

# 2. Generate the batch
batch.generate()

# 3. Show statistics and save the results
batch.show_stats()
batch.save_pdf("batch_puzzles.pdf")
batch.save_csv("batch_puzzles.csv")
```

### Other option
You may also use the package directly from the Jupyter notebooks in `examples/basic_usage.ipynb` — no installation required.

## Puzzle Rules

1. **Puzzle Setup**: The game board is a grid with colored blocks. Blocks are initially placed in the last row or stacked on top of each other. No more than 2 blocks of the same color are aligned horizontally or vertically. Each color must have at least 3 blocks.
2. **GamePlay**: The goal is to remove all blocks from the grid in as few moves as possible.
3. **Available Moves**:
    - *Simple Move*: Move a block left or right if the target cell is empty.
    - *Exchange*: Swap a block with its left or right neighbor if the target cell is occupied.
4. **Elimination Rule**: If 3 or more blocks of the same color are aligned horizontally or vertically, they disappear.
5. **Gravity Rule**: Blocks fall down if unsupported until they reach another block or the bottom of the grid.
6. **Winning Condition**: All blocks are removed from the grid within the allowed number of moves.
