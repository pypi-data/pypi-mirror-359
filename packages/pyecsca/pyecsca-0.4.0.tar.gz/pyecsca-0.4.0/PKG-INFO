**Py**thon **E**lliptic **C**urve cryptography **S**ide-**C**hannel **A**nalysis toolkit.

For more info, see the [![docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-pyecsca.org-black.svg)](https://pyecsca.org/).

## Functionality

**pyecsca** aims to fill a gap in SCA tooling for Elliptic Curve Cryptography, it focuses on
black-box implementations of ECC and presents a way to extract implementation information
about a black-box implementation of ECC through side-channels. The main goal of **pyecsca**
is to be able to reverse engineer the curve model, coordinate system, addition formulas, scalar
multiplier and even finite-field implementation details.

It currently provides:
 - Enumeration of millions of possible ECC implementation configurations (see [notebook/configuration_space](https://pyecsca.org/notebook/configuration_space.html))
 - Simulation and execution tracing of key generation, ECDH and ECDSA (see [notebook/simulation](https://pyecsca.org/notebook/simulation.html))
 - Synthesis of C implementations of ECC for embedded devices, given any implementation configuration (see [notebook/codegen](https://pyecsca.org/notebook/codegen.html)),
   CPU-level simulation of implementations (see [notebook/simulator](https://pyecsca.org/notebook/simulator.html))
 - Trace acquisition using PicoScope/ChipWhisperer oscilloscopes (see [notebook/measurement](https://pyecsca.org/notebook/measurement.html))
 - Trace processing capabilities, e.g. signal-processing, filtering, averaging, cutting, aligning ([pyecsca.sca](https://pyecsca.org/api/pyecsca.sca.html))
 - Trace visualization using holoviews and datashader (see [notebook/visualization](https://pyecsca.org/notebook/visualization.html))
 - Communication via PCSC/LEIA with a smartcard target (see [notebook/smartcards](https://pyecsca.org/notebook/smartcards.html))
 - Reverse-engineering of black-box ECC via RPA-RE and ZVP-RE methods (see [notebook/re/rpa](https://pyecsca.org/notebook/re/rpa.html) and [notebook/re/zvp](https://pyecsca.org/notebook/re/zvp.html))

**pyecsca** consists of three packages:
 - the core: https://github.com/J08nY/pyecsca
 - the codegen package: https://github.com/J08nY/pyecsca-codegen
 - the notebook package: https://github.com/J08nY/pyecsca-notebook

## Tutorials

To learn more about the toolkit you can check out two tutorials on it.
 - One from the [SummerSchool on Real-World Crypto and Privacy 2024](https://github.com/J08nY/pyecsca-tutorial-croatia2024) in Vodice, Croatia.
 - One from the [Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (CHES) 2024](https://github.com/J08nY/pyecsca-tutorial-ches2024) conference in Halifax, Canada.
