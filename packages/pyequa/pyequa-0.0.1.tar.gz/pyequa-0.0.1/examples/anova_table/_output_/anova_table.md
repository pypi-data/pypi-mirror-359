## Variant 001 (data row is 01)


In a study examining the effective duration of insulating fluids under a 35KV load, **4** types of fluids were analyzed, and **4** measurements (in hours) were recorded for each. Subsequently, ANOVA was conducted to evaluate potential mean differences among the fluid types.


**ANOVA** of "duration of insulating fluids under a 35KV load":
