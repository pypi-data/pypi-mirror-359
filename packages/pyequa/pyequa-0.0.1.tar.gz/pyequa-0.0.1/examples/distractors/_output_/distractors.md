# Problem 001 (data row is 01)



Let Y be the number of days, in a total of **0.25** days, that demands are satisfied where demand is independent from day to day. The probabilty, in a random day, that the demand is satisfied is **3**. The shop manager say there is the need for total of **30** each day.


**(a)** The distribution of Y is **0.051**.

**(b)** P(Y > **2**) = {:NUMERICAL:%100%0.9:0.05}
