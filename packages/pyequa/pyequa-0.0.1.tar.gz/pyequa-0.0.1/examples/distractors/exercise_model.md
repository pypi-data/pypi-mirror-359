

Let Y be the number of days, in a total of {nweekdays} days, that demands are satisfied where demand is independent from day to day. The probabilty, in a random day, that the demand is satisfied is {probsucess}. The shop manager say there is the need for total of {n_packs} each day.


**(a)** The distribution of Y is {Y_Distribution}.

**(b)** P(Y > {y_value}) = {prob}
