# Problem 001 (data row is 01)

Consider a right-tailed hypothesis test for the mean \(\mu\) of a Normal population with known variance:

H0: \(\mu = 5\) versus  H1: \(\mu > 5\)

Considering

* \(z_\text{obs}\) = **3.0902**,
* p-value = **0.001** = \( P(Z \ge  z_\text{obs}) \),
* \(\alpha\) = **0.01**

**reject** the null hypothesis (H0) because p-value **is lower** than \(\alpha\).

The expected value (population mean), \(\mu\), {:MULTICHOICE_S:%100%is significative\~%0%is not significative} greater than 5.

{:MULTICHOICE_S:%100%reject\~%0%don't reject} the null hypothesis (H0) because p-value **is lower** than \(\alpha\).

The expected value (population mean), \(\mu\), **is significative** greater than 5.
