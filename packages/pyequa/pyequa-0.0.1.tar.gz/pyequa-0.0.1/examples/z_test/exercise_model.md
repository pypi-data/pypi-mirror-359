Consider a right-tailed hypothesis test for the mean \(\mu\) of a Normal population with known variance:

H0: \(\mu = 5\) versus  H1: \(\mu > 5\)

Considering

* \(z_\text{{obs}}\) = {zobs},
* p-value = {pvalue} = \( P(Z \ge  z_\text{{obs}}) \),
* \(\alpha\) = {alpha}

{reject} the null hypothesis (H0) because p-value {lowergreater} than \(\alpha\).

The expected value (population mean), \(\mu\), {sig} greater than 5.
