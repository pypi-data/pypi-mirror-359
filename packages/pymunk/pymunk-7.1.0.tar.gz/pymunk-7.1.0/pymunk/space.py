        may seem mushy or bouncy when the objects should be solid. Setting
        the number of iterations lets you balance between CPU usage and the

        Pymunk supports two spatial indexes. The default is an axis-aligned
        bounding box tree inspired by the one used in the Bullet Physics
        library, but caching of overlapping leaves was added to give it very
        good temporal coherence. The tree requires no tuning, and most games
        will find that they get the best performance using from the tree. The
        other available spatial index type available is a spatial hash, which
        can be much faster when you have a very large number (1000s) of
        objects that are all the same size. For smaller numbers of objects,
        or objects that vary a lot in size, the spatial hash is usually much
        slower. It also requires tuning (usually through experimentation) to
        get the best possible performance.

        The spatial hash data is fairly size sensitive. dim is the size of
        the hash cells. Setting dim to the average collision shape size is
        likely to give the best performance. Setting dim too small will cause
        the shape to be inserted into many cells, setting it too low will
        cause too many objects into the same hash slot.

        count is the minimum number of cells in the hash table. If
        there are too few cells, the spatial hash will return many false
        positives. Too many cells will be hard on the cache and waste memory.
        Setting count to ~10x the number of objects in the space is probably a
        good starting point. Tune from there if necessary.

        a and b collide, the callback will be used to process the collision
        events. If no callback is set, the default is to process collision
        normally.

        Its possible to pass in None for one or both of the collision types.
        None matches any collision type on a Shape. However, if
        collision_type_a is None, then collision_type_b must also be None.

        If you call this multiple times with the same combination of
        collision_type_a and collision_type_b, then the last call will
        overwrite the earlier.

        If multiple callbacks match the collision, the order will be that the
        most specific handler is called first.

        Callback phases:

            - **begin**: Two shapes just started touching for the first time
              this step.
            - **pre_solve**: Two shapes are touching during this step, before
              collision resolution. You may override collision values using
              Arbiter.friction, Arbiter.elasticity or Arbiter.surfaceVelocity
              to provide custom friction, elasticity, or surface velocity
              values. See Arbiter for more info.
            - **post_solve**: Two shapes are touching and their collision response
              has been processed. You can retrieve the collision impulse or
              kinetic energy at this time if you want to use it to calculate
              sound volumes or damage amounts. See Arbiter for more info.
            - **separate**: Two shapes have just stopped touching for the
              first time this step. To ensure that begin()/separate() are
              always called in balanced pairs, it will also be called when
              removing a shape while its in contact with something or when
              de-allocating the space.

        From each callback you can set process_collision on the Arbiter,
        which decides if the collision should be processed or not.

        data will be passed in to the callback function unchanged.
