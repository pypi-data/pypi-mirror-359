You are now in a Docker container running Ubuntu. To build your app
for this platform, use the normal commands `beetle freeze` etc.

Note that you can't launch GUIs here. So eg. `beetle run` won't work.

Another caveat is that target/ here is special: It symlinks to your
usual target/ubuntu/. So when you are done and type `exit` to leave
this container, you can find the produced binaries there.
