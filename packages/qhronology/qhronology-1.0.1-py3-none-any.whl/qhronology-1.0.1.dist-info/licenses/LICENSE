Guidelines on distinguishing use
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Whether a particular use of Qhronology is considered to be either "non-commercial" or "commercial" depends on the use, not the user, and some guidelines are set out below:

- *Non-commercial* use is anticipated to primarily involve students and teachers who may wish to use Qhronology at home and/or an accredited academic institution (e.g., school, university, etc.) for the purpose of education, without intending to seek any commercial advantage or financial gain. This includes teachers in schools and universities where tuition fees are charged, so long as the use of Qhronology is limited to personal or individual classroom teaching or public academic research.

- *Commercial* use is anticipated to primarily involve publishers, online schools, online universities, and other organizations (both for-profit and non-profit) who wish to use Qhronology to support activities that are intended toward securing a commercial advantage or the generation of revenue or monetary compensation. This includes, but is not limited to, any of the following:

  - The use of Qhronology (and its source code) to generate or develop educational materials or resources which will be sold in exchange for a fee (including course or tuition fees) or (if given away for free) which are used to gain a commercial advantage for the user.

  - The provision of training, support or editorial services that use or reference Qhronology in exchange for a fee.

  - The use of Qhronology (and its source code) within a non-academic ebook, textbook, or journal, whether or not the publication is distributed for a fee. Please note that the use of Qhronology in publicly available academic papers and conferences is considered to be non-commercial use and so does not require a commercial license agreement.

  - The use of Qhronology (and its source code) to assist in securing advertising or sponsorship revenues.

  - The use of Qhronology (and its source code) for training machine learning models or artificial intelligence systems, including its incorporation into any dataset used for such purposes.
