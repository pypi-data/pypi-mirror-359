# Qhronology

_Qhronology_ is a Python package for computing the states of the chronology-respecting (CR) and chronology-violating (CV) quantum systems according to the foremost quantum theories of time travel. It also functions as a (mostly) complete quantum circuit simulator, and contains an engine for the basic visualization of quantum circuit diagrams. Its main features include:

- temporal paradox resolution using quantum-mechanical prescriptions of time travel

  - Deutsch's model (D-CTCs)
  - postselected teleportation (P-CTCs)

- general quantum computation and information processing

  - algebraic, symbolic calculations
  - (classical) simulation of quantum experiments (limited by the finite precision of floating-point arithmetic)

- quantum circuit visualization 

  - text-based semigraphical diagrams constructed using glyphs from monospace fonts (support for both ASCII and Unicode)

The primary purpose of Qhronology is to facilitate the study of quantum theories of time travel in both educational and research capacities. In addition to this, the package also functions as a quantum circuit simulator, allowing for comprehensive analysis of the general quantum operations of quantum information processing and computation. Qhronology's underlying mathematical system accomplishes this using the standard $d$-dimensional matrix mechanics of discrete-variable quantum theory in a general $\mathbb{C}^d$-representation.

The package provides a sufficiently complete and self-contained set of tools with the intention that performing transformations on quantum constructs and data with external packages and libraries need not be necessary (in most cases). Qhronology aims to make the expression of quantum states, gates, circuits, and time-travel prescriptions near-limitlessly possible with a framework that is syntactically simple, informationally dense, programmatically intuitive, mathematically powerful, extremely flexible, and easily extensible.

In addition to functionality provided by Python's standard library, Qhronology is built around features from both the canonical [SymPy](https://sympy.org) ([repository](https://github.com/sympy/sympy)) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org) ([repository](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)) projects. In particular, the package greatly leverages the symbolic and linear algebra capabilities of the former, and so aims to have a deep compatibility with SymPy and its matrix objects. It is hoped that users possessing experience with these projects should therefore find Qhronology's interface both familiar and intuitive.

> [!NOTE]
> Qhronology in its current form is considered to be highly experimental. Its output may be incorrect, and some features may not work as intended. Additionally, please note that its functionality, including any and all functions, classes, methods, and modules, may be subject to change in future versions.

## Features

### Quantum computing simulations

Designed to provide a powerful set of features with a simple and intuitive syntax, Qhronology facilitates the simulation of quantum computation, information processing, and algebraic calculations.

### Quantum resolutions to antichronological time-travel paradoxes

The fundamental indeterminism of quantum mechanics can be leveraged to provide resolutions to quantum formulations of classic time-travel paradoxes (such as the infamous *grandfather paradox*). A select few prescriptions by which this may be achieved, including Deutsch's model (D-CTCs) and the postselected teleportation prescription (P-CTCs), are implemented both as bare functions and class methods.

### Quantum circuit visualization

Quantum circuit diagrams provide a powerful picturalism through which any quantum process can be visualized as a network of quantum logic gates connected by wires. Qhronology provides this functionality for any quantum process constructed using its built-in classes.

### Numerous examples

Bundled with the project is a small collection of complete examples that showcase its capabilities and syntax. These are divided into two categories: _Quantum algorithms and protocols_ and _Quantum closed timelike curves_. The former contains implementations of canonical algorithms in quantum computing, while the latter consists of more exotic circuits that use quantum mechanics to resolve paradoxical scenarios of antichronological time travel.

### Foundational theory

All of the underlying mathematics upon which Qhronology is built is presented as a series of pedagogical reference articles within the documentation. This includes sections on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics (Hilbert spaces, linear operators, composite systems, etc.), quantum theory on both discrete and continuous Hilbert spaces, a brief overview of the quantum circuitry picturalism, and physical theories of time travel (both classical and quantum).

The aim of this theory is to serve as a comprehensive and complete reference for basic quantum mechanics and physical theories of time travel, thereby enabling the keen user to embark upon further research into these fascinating areas of study.

## Documentation

The latest version of the documentation for the package is available at:

- The official website: https://qhronology.com
- The official PDF document: [Qhronology.pdf](https://github.com/lgbishop/qhronology/blob/latest/docs/_build/latex/Qhronology.pdf)

Both of these are built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) ([repository](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx)), with their shared source files residing within the `docs` directory at the root of the project's repository. This includes all project text and artwork. Please see [shell-sphinx.nix](https://github.com/lgbishop/qhronology/blob/latest/docs/shell-sphinx.nix) within that directory for a list of dependencies required to build both documentation targets. Note that a full LaTeX system installation from 2024 or later is required to build the project's PDF documentation, figures, and artwork (including the logo). Also note that the documentation's rendered circuit diagrams (generated from the package itself) were created using a custom LaTeX template [render-text.tex](https://github.com/lgbishop/qhronology/blob/latest/docs/source/figures/render-text.tex) and associated shell script [render-text.sh](https://github.com/lgbishop/qhronology/blob/latest/docs/source/figures/render-text.sh).
