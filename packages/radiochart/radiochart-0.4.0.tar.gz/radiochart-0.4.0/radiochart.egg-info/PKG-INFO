- Automatically generates a hierarchical chart image (PNG, SVG, PDF)  
- Color-coded squads and their fireteams for easy visualization  
- Lightweight CLI tool with no external dependencies except Graphviz  
- Ready for future extension to web app or other input formats  

---

## Installation

### 1. Install [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/)

Make sure the Graphviz system binaries are installed and available on your system `PATH`.

- **Windows:** Download and install from https://graphviz.org/download/  
  Check **"Add Graphviz to system PATH"** during installation.

- **macOS:**  
  ```bash
  brew install graphviz
  ```

- **Ubuntu/Debian:** 
    ```bash
    sudo apt install graphviz
    ```

### 2. Install [radiochart](https://pypi.org/project/radiochart/)

```bash
pip install radiochart
```

## Usage

```bash
radiochart --input net_structure.json --output chart.png
```

## Example JSON Input (net_structure.json)

```json
{
  "Company Net (CH 1)": {
    "Platoon Net (CH 2)": {
      "Alpha Squad (CH 3)": {
        "Alpha Squad Fireteam 1 (CH 31)": {},
        "Alpha Squad Fireteam 2 (CH 32)": {}
      },
      "Bravo Squad (CH 4)": {
        "Bravo Squad Fireteam 1 (CH 41)": {},
        "Bravo Squad Fireteam 2 (CH 42)": {}
      },
      "Charlie Squad (CH 5)": {
        "Charlie Squad Fireteam 1 (CH 51)": {},
        "Charlie Squad Fireteam 2 (CH 52)": {}
      },
      "Whiskey Squad (CH 6)": {
        "Whiskey Squad Fireteam 1 (CH 61)": {},
        "Whiskey Squad Fireteam 2 (CH 62)": {}
      }
    },
    "Enablers (CH 7)": {},
    "Aviation (CH 8)": {},
    "Tac Air (CH 9)": {},
    "Medevac (CH 10)": {}
  }
}
```

## Output

This will generate a hierarchical chart image showing the nets, squads, and fireteams, with color-coded squads and their fireteams for clarity.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see errors related to dot or graphviz executable not found, make sure Graphviz is installed and added to your system PATH.
- On Windows, restart your terminal after installing Graphviz.
- Verify installation by running:
```bash
dot -V
```

## Future Enhancements

- Support for YAML or CSV input
- Web application
- Additional styling options
