# Artificial Intelligence Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines 
capable of intelligent behavior. AI systems can perform tasks that typically require human 
intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language 
translation.

## Key Components of AI

1. **Machine Learning**: Algorithms that improve automatically through experience
2. **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding and generating human language
3. **Computer Vision**: Interpreting and understanding visual information
4. **Robotics**: Physical manifestation of AI in robotic systems

## Applications

AI is used in various industries including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment.
Common applications include recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, 
and fraud detection.

# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating 
algorithms that can learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data
- Examples: classification, regression
- Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks

### Unsupervised Learning  
- Finds patterns in unlabeled data
- Examples: clustering, dimensionality reduction
- Algorithms: K-Means, PCA, Autoencoders

### Reinforcement Learning
