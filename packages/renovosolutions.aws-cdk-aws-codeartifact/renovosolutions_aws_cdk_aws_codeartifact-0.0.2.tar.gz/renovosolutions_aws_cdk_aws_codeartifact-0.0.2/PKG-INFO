AWS CodeArtifact is a fully managed artifact repository service that makes it easy for organizations of any size to securely store, publish, and share software packages used in their software development process. CodeArtifact can be configured to automatically fetch software packages and dependencies from public artifact repositories so developers have access to the latest versions. CodeArtifact works with commonly used package managers and build tools like Maven, Gradle, npm, yarn, twine, pip, and NuGet making it easy to integrate into existing development workflows.

For further information on AWS CodeArtifact, see the [AWS CodeArtifact documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/).

Add a CodeArtifact Domain to your stack:

```python
import * as codeartifact from '@renovosolutions/cdk-library-aws-codeartifact';

new codeartifact.Domain(stack, 'domain', { name: 'example-domain' });
```

Add a CodeArtifact Repository to your stack:

```python
import * as codeartifact from '@renovosolutions/cdk-library-aws-codeartifact';

const domain = new codeartifact.Domain(stack, 'domain', { name: 'example-domain' });
const repository = new codeartifact.Repository(stack, 'repository', {
    name: 'repository',
    domain,
});
```

It is also possible to use the `addRepository` method on `codeartifact.Domain` to add a repository.

```python
import * as codeartifact from '@renovosolutions/cdk-library-aws-codeartifact';

const domain = new codeartifact.Domain(stack, 'domain', { name: 'example-domain' });

domain.addRepository('repo', {
  name: 'repository'
});
```
