===================

Added
-----
- Add ``Metadata`` resource

Fixed
-----
- Fix the way ``RNATables`` are imported in the docs


===================
14.0.0 - 2022-01-19
===================

Changed
-------
- Deprecate ``resdk.CollectionTables``, use ``resdk.tables.RNATables`` instead
- Update ``resdk.resourcec.kb.Feature.query_endpoint`` to sync with change in
  Resolwe-bio
- Deprecate the following methods for setting permissions:

  - ``add_public()`` and ``remove_public()``
  - ``add_user()`` and ``remove_user()``
  - ``add_group()`` and ``remove_group()``


===================
13.8.0 - 2021-12-07
===================

Added
-----
- Support retrieval of QC values in ReSDK tables via ``qc`` attribute
- Add ``resdk.tables.MATables`` for microarray data support

Changed
-------
- In ResdkTables, warn user if multiple Data of same
  ``ResdkTables.process_type`` are in one sample. If they are, use
  only the newest one.


===================
13.7.0 - 2021-11-17
===================

Added
-----
- Enable setting ``process_resources`` as an attribute on ``Data`` as
  well as on input to method ``run``. This makes it possible to raise
  process resources (cores, memory, storage) beyond what is specified in
  the process definition.

Changed
-------
- Sync with permission changes in Resolwe. This introduces new methods
  for setting permissions::

  - ``add_public()`` and ``remove_public()`` are replaced by ``set_public()``
  - ``add_user()`` and ``remove_user()`` are replaced by ``set_user()``
  - ``add_group()`` and ``remove_group()`` are replaced by ``set_group()``

  For details about their usage see function docs. Old methods still
  work and will be kept until Q1 2022 but they will raise a deprecation
  warning.
- Index of ``resdk.tables`` is now based on sample ID rather than on sample
  name. To ease the naming ``readable_index`` property is added - it maps
  sample ID's to sample names.


===================
13.6.0 - 2021-10-20
===================

Changed
-------
- Sync permissions handling with backend changes. This means that
  setting permissions will only be possible with this version of ReSDK
  (or higher) as of 2021-10-20.

Fixed
-----
- Fix ReSDK Tables caching: loading of cached tables fails in resdk
  ``13.5.1``


===================
13.5.1 - 2021-09-16
===================

Fixed
-----
- Fix ReSDK Tables so they can cache also very large collections
  (greater than 4Gb in memory)


===================
13.5.0 - 2021-09-13
===================

Added
-----
- ``CollectionTables`` functionality is now generalized to also
  accommodate different types of data: RNA and methylation. Calling
  ``CollectionTables`` remains backwards compatible, but will issue a
  deprecation warning. Users are encouraged to use new modules as

    - resdk.tables.RNATables
    - resdk.tables.MethylationTables

Changed
-------
- ``CollectionTables`` is now faster in merging expressions, especially
  if there are different sets of genes in different samples
- Return ``Genset.genes`` as sorted list instead of set


===================
13.4.0 - 2021-08-12
===================

Added
-----
- Add ``Geneset`` resource. This should significantly simplify the
  manipulation of genesets.

Changed
-------
- Replace Travis CI with GitHub actions

Fixed
-----
- Fix mismatched meta and expression data index


===================
13.3.0 - 2021-05-18
===================

Added
-----
- Add ``progress_callable`` argument to ``CollectionTables`` constructor. This
  enables that progress of expressions download is reported to any callable
- Add check that prevents crating ``CollectionTables`` with heterogeneous
  collections
- Add ``expression_source`` and ``expression_process_slug`` filters to
  ``CollectionTables`` constructor. This enables to use just a specific,
  homogeneous part of the collection


===================
13.2.0 - 2021-05-03
===================

Changed
-------
- Faster download of files in ``CollectionTables.rc`` and
  ``CollectionTables.exp`` by using async download

===================
12.2.0 - 2020-09-15
===================

Added
-----
- Add ``<dst>.permissions.copy_from(<src>)`` method that copies permissions
  from ``<src>`` to ``<dst>`` resource. e.g. To copy permissions from
  Sample ``s1`` to Sample ``s2``: ``s2.permissions.copy_from(s1)``


===================
12.1.1 - 2020-05-21
===================

Fixed
-----

===================
12.1.0 - 2020-05-18
===================

Added
-----

- Add attributes ``owners``, ``editors`` and ``viewers`` to
  ``PermissionsManager``. For example, one can now see who are owners of
  Collection ``c1`` with ``c1.permissions.owners``
- Add ``iterate`` method to ``ResolweQuery``. This solves the
  ``504 Gateway Time-out`` when one wants to fetch all (or hundreds)
  objects from server.
- Support collection inheritance in ``Data.duplicate()``

Fixed
-----

===================
11.0.1 - 2019-08-19
===================

Fix
---
* Fix ``ResolweQuery.get`` method. This fix handles the case when object is
  not uniquely defined by ``slug`` (but it is with ``slug`` and ``version``)


===================
11.0.0 - 2019-08-14
===================

Changed
-------
* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Remove scripts folder. This removes
  ``resolwe-upload-reads`` command line utility.
* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Remove analysis folder. This removes many
  methods that could be run on multiple resources::

    - ``bamsplit``, ``macs``, ``rose2``
    - ``cuffdiff``
    - ``cuffquant``, ``cuffnorm``
    - ``bamplot``, ``bamliquidator``
    - ``prepare_geo``, ``prepare_geo_chipseq``, ``prepare_geo_rnaseq``

  These methods are not needed anymore as most of the functionality that
  they provide can be handled by relations in UI.
* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** The following utilty functions were removed as
  they were not used anymore: ``find_field``, ``get_samples``,
  ``get_resource_collection`` and ``get_resolwe``
* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Resolwe server now enforces that Data can
  only be in one sample and one collection. Sample can only be in one
  collection as well. This implies the following changes:

  - Before, ``Data``/``Sample`` was added/removed to ``Sample``/``Collection``
    through ``add_data``, ``remove_data``, ``add_samples`` and
    ``remove_samples`` methods. These are removed. From now on, ``Data``
    resource has writable attributes ``collection`` and ``sample`` and Sample
    resource has ``collection`` attribute. Adding ``Data`` to ``Collection``
    is as simple as ``Data.collection = <Collection instance>`` and than
    ``Data.save()``
  - Method ``delete()`` on Samples and Collections does not accept
    ``delete_content`` parameter anymore. From now, when Collection or Sample
    is deleted, all of it's content is deleted automatically.
  - Resolwe.run method now has ``collection`` argument instead of
    ``collections``. This argument can accept Collection resource or it's id.
* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Data resource now has a ``process``
  attribute, which is an instance of ``Process`` resource. Therefore the
  following Data attributes are removed as they can be acessed through
  Data.process::

  - process_name
  - process_slug
  - process_type
  - process_input_schema
  - process_output_schema

Added
-----
* Add ``fetch_object`` classmethod to ``BaseResource`` class.
* Add ``get_query_by_resource`` method to ``Resolwe`` class. It gives the
  correct ResolweQuerry for a given resource class/instance.


===================
10.1.0 - 2019-07-18
===================

Changed
-------
* Sync ``Data.parents`` and ``Data.children`` with backend changes

Fix
---
* Replace obsolete workflow in tutorial with a newer one
* Remove Python 2 references from docs


===================
10.0.0 - 2019-05-08
===================

Changed
-------
* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Remove support for Python 2
* Remove tests for old Python3 versions: Python 3.4 and 3.5
* Filtering is now updated with latest changes in Resolwe. A lot of
  inconsistencies are fixed and error messages should be more clear now.

Added
-----
* Add ``delete_content`` parameter to ``Collection.delete()`` and
  ``Sample.delete()`` methods. This not only deletes given
  Samples / Collections but also contained Data / Samples.
* Add support for Python 3.7
* In addition to data and sample statistics ``Resolwe.data_usage`` method
  now also reports collection statistics.


==================
9.0.0 - 2019-02-19
==================

Changed
-------
* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Remove unused ``ResolweQuery.post`` method
* Make contributor attribute a User object
* Cast date-time attributes to datetime objects. This means, for example,
  that ``created`` attribute is now Python datetime object instead of string.
* Update prepare_geo_chipseq analysis to reflect process chnages

Added
-----
* Implement full text search method in ``ResolweQuery`` for ``Data``,
  ``Sample`` and ``Collection`` resources
* Support ``delete_content`` parameter in ``delete()`` method for Samples and
  Collections. This enables one to also delete all of the Data / Samples
  in a given Sample / Collection


==================
8.0.0 - 2018-11-20
==================

Changed
-------
* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Rename argument ``file_type`` to ``field_name``
  in ``BaseCollection.download`` method
* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE:** Remove ``Data.annotation`` attribute

Added
-----
* Add missing resource classes in the Reference section of documentation
* Add ``Resolwe.data_usage`` method. It displays number of samples, data
  objects and sum of data object sizes for currently logged-in user. For admin
  users, it displays data for all users.
* Add the support for using ``file`` and ``file_temp`` dictionary syntax
  when uploading remote (URL, FTP) files in Resolwe upload processes

Fixed
-----
* Handle samples with multiple ``fastq`` objects in ``get_reads`` method. By
  default the latest of all data whose ``process_type`` starts with
  ``data:reads:fastq`` is returned. If any other of the ``fastq`` objects is
  required, user can provide additional ``filter`` arguments and limits search
  to one result.
* Recreate resource queries (e.g. ``Resolwe.data``, ``Resolwe.relation``, ...)
  at each login. Previously it could happen that e.g. ``Resolwe.data`` listed
  only public data while ``Resolwe.data.all()`` displayed all objects with
  view permission. This behaviour is now unified: user can see all objects for
  which he has view permission.
