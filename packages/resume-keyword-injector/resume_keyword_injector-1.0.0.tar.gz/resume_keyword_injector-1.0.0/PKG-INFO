## =, How It Works

### The Science Behind Invisible Keywords

ATS systems extract **all text** from PDFs, including text that's invisible to human readers. Our tool leverages this by strategically placing keywords using methods that are:

-  **Detectable by ATS**: Text extraction algorithms find them
-  **Invisible to humans**: Won't interfere with your resume's appearance  
-  **Format-preserving**: Original layout remains untouched

### Technical Implementation

1. **PDF Analysis**: Extract existing text and analyze document structure
2. **Strategic Placement**: Position keywords using advanced PDF overlay techniques
3. **Invisibility Application**: Apply chosen methods (tiny fonts, white text, etc.)
4. **Quality Verification**: Ensure keywords are detectable but invisible
5. **Format Preservation**: Merge with original while maintaining all formatting

### ATS Compatibility

Tested with common ATS text extraction methods:
-  **pdfplumber** - High accuracy text extraction
-  **PyPDF** - Standard PDF text parsing
-  **Adobe PDF API** - Professional PDF processing
-  **Google Document AI** - Machine learning text extraction
