# RolyPoly

RolyPoly is an RNA virus analysis toolkit, including a variety of commands and wrappers for external tools (from raw read processing to genome annotation). It also includes an "end-2-end" command that employs an entire pipeline.   
For more detailed information, please refer to the [docs](https://pages.jgi.doe.gov/rolypoly/docs/).

## Installation
We hope to have rolypoly available from bioconda in the near future.  
In the meantime, it can be installed with the [`quick_setup.sh`](https://code.jgi.doe.gov/rolypoly/rolypoly/-/raw/main/src/setup/quick_setup.sh) script which which will also fetch the pre-generated data rolypoly will require.

```bash
curl -O https://code.jgi.doe.gov/rolypoly/rolypoly/-/raw/main/src/setup/quick_setup.sh && \
bash quick_setup.sh 
```

You can specify custom paths for the code, databases, and conda enviroment location:
```bash
bash quick_setup.sh /path/to/conda/env /path/to/install/rolypoly_code /path/to/store/databases /path/to/logfile
```
By default if no positional arguments are supplied, rolypoly is installed into the session current folder (path the quick_setup.sh is called from): 
- database in `./rolypoly/data/`
- code in `./rolypoly/code/ `
- conda enviroment in `./rolypoly/env/`
- log file in `./RolyPoly_quick_setup.log` 

To install rolypoly in development mode, use:
```bash
bash quick_setup.sh /path/to/conda/env /path/to/install/rolypoly_code /path/to/store/databases /path/to/logfile TRUE
```


## Usage
RolyPoly is a command-line tool with subcommands for different stages of the RNA virus identification pipeline. For a detailed help (in terminal), use `rolypoly help`. For more specific help, see the [docs](./https://pages.jgi.doe.gov/rolypoly/docs/commands/index.md).

```bash
rolypoly [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
 ```

## Motivation
Current workflows for RNA virus detection are functional but could be improved, especially by utilizing raw reads instead of pre-existing, general-purpose made, assemblies. Here we proceed with more specific processes tailored for RNA viruses.

Several similar software exist, but have different uses, for example:  
- hecatomb ([github.com/shandley/hecatomb](https://github.com/shandley/hecatomb)): uses mmseqs for homology detection and thus is less sensitive than the additional HMMer based identification herein.
- AliMarko ([biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.19.603887](https://biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.19.603887)): Utilizes a single-sample assembly only approach, not supporting co/cross assembly of multiple samples. Additionally, AliMarko uses a small, partially outdated (IMO) HMM profile set.
