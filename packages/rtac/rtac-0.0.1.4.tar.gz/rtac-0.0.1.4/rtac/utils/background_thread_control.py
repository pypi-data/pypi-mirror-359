'''Numpy, scipy and sklearn background libraries spawn threads that may clog
CPU through oversubscription. This can interfere with the performance 
measurement of algorithms that are configured, especially if all system cores
are utilized in the tournaments. Because of this, we set the maximum thread
numbers to 1. It has to happen before any of the modules are loaded.'''
