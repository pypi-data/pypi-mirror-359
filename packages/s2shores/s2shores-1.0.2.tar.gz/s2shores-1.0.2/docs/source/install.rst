Installation

Installation on Linux
=====================

-------------
With Anaconda
-------------

To install S2shores on Linux using Anaconda, you'll first need to create a Conda environment with a compatible version of Python and libgdal.
Once the environment is set up, you can install S2shores via pip.

Please follow these steps:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda create -n env_name -y
    $ conda activate env_name
    $ conda install python=3.12 libgdal=3.10 -c conda-forge -y
    $ pip install GDAL==3.10
    $ pip install s2shores==1.0.0 --no-cache-dir


-----------
With pip
-----------

If you are not using Anaconda, you need to manually install GDAL and its development libraries before installing S2shores.

Please follow these steps:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa && sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install gdal-bin
    $ sudo apt-get install libgdal-dev
    $ export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal
    $ export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal


Once GDAL is installed and the paths are correctly set, you can create a Python virtual environment and install S2shores with pip.

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m venv env_name
    $ source env_name/bin/activate
    $ pip install GDAL #Regarding the libgdal-dev version available on your system
    $ pip install s2shores==1.0.0 --no-cache-dir



Installation on Windows
=======================

-------------
With Anaconda
-------------

To install S2shores on Windows using Anaconda, create a Conda environment, install the required version of GDAL, and then use pip to install S2shores.

Please follow these steps:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda create -n env_name -y
    $ conda activate env_name
    $ conda install gdal=3.10 -c conda-forge -y
    $ pip install s2shores==1.0.0 --no-cache-dir

--------------------------------------------
With pip (not recommended, at your own risk)
--------------------------------------------

Installing S2shores without Anaconda is not recommended, particularly because it requires the use of an unknown wheel file that may be unmaintained or unreliable.

However, if you still prefer to install without Anaconda, make sure that Python is added to your system's PATH.
Youâ€™ll need to install GDAL manually from a .whl (Windows Wheel) file, available `here <https://github.com/cgohlke/geospatial-wheels/releases/>`_.

The version you will need is:

    - GDAL-3.10.1-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl (for Python 3.12 on 64-bit Windows)

Once you have the appropriate .whl file, please follow these steps:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m venv env_name
    $ env_name\Scripts\activate
    $ pip install path_to_the_wheel\GDAL-3.10.1-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl
    $ pip install s2shores==1.0.0 --no-cache-dir
