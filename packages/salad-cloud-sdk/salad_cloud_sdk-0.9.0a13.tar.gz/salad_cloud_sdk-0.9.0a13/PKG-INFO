# SaladCloudSdk Python SDK 0.9.0-alpha.13<a id="saladcloudsdk-python-sdk-090-alpha13"></a>

Welcome to the SaladCloudSdk SDK documentation. This guide will help you get started with integrating and using the SaladCloudSdk SDK in your project.

[![This SDK was generated by liblab](https://public-liblab-readme-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/built-by-liblab-icon.svg)](https://liblab.com/?utm_source=readme)

## Setup & Configuration<a id="setup--configuration"></a>

### Supported Language Versions<a id="supported-language-versions"></a>

This SDK is compatible with the following versions: `Python >= 3.7`

### Installation<a id="installation"></a>

To get started with the SDK, we recommend installing using `pip`:

```bash
pip install salad-cloud-sdk
```

## Authentication<a id="authentication"></a>

### API Key Authentication<a id="api-key-authentication"></a>

The SaladCloudSdk API uses API keys as a form of authentication. An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate a user, developer, or a program that is calling the API.

#### Setting the API key<a id="setting-the-api-key"></a>

When you initialize the SDK, you can set the API key as follows:

```py
SaladCloudSdk(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    api_key_header="YOUR_API_KEY_HEADER",
    timeout=10000
)
```

If you need to set or update the API key after initializing the SDK, you can use:

```py
sdk.set_api_key("YOUR_API_KEY", "YOUR_API_KEY_HEADER")
```

## Setting a Custom Timeout<a id="setting-a-custom-timeout"></a>

You can set a custom timeout for the SDK's HTTP requests as follows:

```py
from salad_cloud_sdk import SaladCloudSdk

sdk = SaladCloudSdk(timeout=10000)
```

# Sample Usage<a id="sample-usage"></a>

Below is a comprehensive example demonstrating how to authenticate and call a simple endpoint:

```py
from salad_cloud_sdk import SaladCloudSdk

sdk = SaladCloudSdk(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    api_key_header="YOUR_API_KEY_HEADER",
    timeout=10000
)

result = sdk.quotas.get_quotas(organization_name="acme-corp")

print(result)

```

# Async Usage<a id="async-usage"></a>

The SDK includes an Async Client for making asynchronous API requests. This is useful for applications that need non-blocking operations, like web servers or apps with a graphical user interface.

```py
import asyncio
from salad_cloud_sdk import SaladCloudSdkAsync

sdk = SaladCloudSdkAsync(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    api_key_header="YOUR_API_KEY_HEADER",
    timeout=10000
)


async def main():
  result = await sdk.quotas.get_quotas(organization_name="acme-corp")
  print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```
