scCausalVI is a causality-aware generative model designed to disentangle inherent cellular heterogeneity from treatment effects in single-cell RNA sequencing data, particularly in case-control studies.

## Introduction

scCausalVI addresses a major analytical challenge in single-cell RNA sequencing: distinguishing inherent cellular variation from extrinsic cell-state-specific effects induced by external stimuli. The model:

- Decouples intrinsic cellular states from treatment effects through a deep structural causal network
- Explicitly models causal mechanisms governing cell-state-specific responses
- Enables cross-condition in silico prediction
- Accounts for technical variations in multi-source data integration
- Identifies treatment-responsive populations and molecular signatures

### Key Features of scCausalVI
- Interpretable and disentangled latent representation
- Data integration
- In silico perturbation
- Identification of treatment-responsive populations
