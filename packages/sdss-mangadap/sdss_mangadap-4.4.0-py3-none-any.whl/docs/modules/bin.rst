.. include:: ../tables/spatiallybinnedspectradef.rst

*Important class dependencies*:

 * :class:`~mangadap.util.extinction.GalacticExtinction`: Provides the
   Galactic extinction curves the can be selected and applied to the
   data.
 * :mod:`mangadap.proc.spatialbinning`: Provides the classes that
   perform the binning (e.g.,
   :class:`~mangadap.proc.spatialbinning.VoronoiBinning`).
 * :class:`~mangadap.proc.spectralstack.SpectralStack`: Provides the core
   functions that perform the spectral stacking

*Algorithm*:

 * Ignore any pixels that are either masked by the boolean mask or
   flagged with the flags returned by
   :func:`~mangadap.datacube.datacube.DataCube.do_not_use_flags`.
 * Calculate the Galactic extinction (``REDCORR`` in the DAP
   ``LOGCUBE`` file)
 * Using
   :class:`~mangadap.proc.reductionassessments.ReductionAssessment`
   object, find spaxels with >0.8 fractional spectral coverage and above
   the ``minimum_snr`` in the configuration file.  Only those spaxels
   satisfying both criteria are included in any bin.
 * Determine which spaxels to put in each bin following the ``method``
   specified in the config file:

    * ``none`` (``SPX`` binning type): No binning performed.  Every
      selected spaxels given a unique bin ID.
    * ``global`` (``ALL`` binning type): Bin all valid spaxels into a
      single spectrum.
    * ``radial`` (e.g., ``NRE`` binning type): Use the elliptical
      coordinates from the
      :class:`~mangadap.proc.reductionassessments.ReductionAssessment`
      object to assign each spaxel to a unique radial bin.  The binning
      annuli are defined using the ``center``, ``pa``, ``ell``,
      ``radius_scale``, ``radii``, and ``log_step`` config values; see
      ``$MANGADAP_DIR/mangadap/config/spatial_binning/nre.ini``
      for the ``NRE`` binning case.  If ``pa``, ``ell``, or
      ``radius_scale`` are -1, they are replaced by ``pa``, ``ell``, and
      ``reff``, respectively, from :ref:`execution-config`.
    * ``voronoi`` (e.g., ``VOR10`` binning type): Use the Voronoi
      tessellation binning algorithm (written by M. Cappellari; see
      `vorbin`_) to continually accrete adjacent spaxels to reach a
      minimum S/N (set by ``target_snr`` in config), accounting for
      covariance if available, using the signal and noise
      measurements from the
      :class:`~mangadap.proc.reductionassessments.ReductionAssessment`
      object.

 * Stack all spectra assigned to a single bin:

    * Spectra are combined following the specified ``operation`` in
      config.  Available options are set by
      :func:`~mangadap.proc.spectralstack.SpectralStack.operation_options`.
    * Account for covariance according to ``stack_covariance_mode`` and
      ``stack_covariance_par`` in config.  Available options are set by
      :func:`~mangadap.proc.spectralstack.SpectralStack.covariance_mode_options`.
    * Mask any wavelength channels in each spaxel with no unmasked
      pixels from the stack (maskbit set to ``FLUXINVALID`` in DAP
      ``LOGCUBE`` file).

 * Construct the map with the bin ID of each spaxel (``BINID`` in
   ``MAPS`` file)
 * Calculate the mean signal (``BIN_MFLUX`` in ``MAPS`` file), variance
   (inverse of ``BIN_MFLUX_IVAR`` in ``MAPS`` file) and S/N
   (``BIN_SNR`` in ``MAPS`` file) of the stacked spectra. This is
   done over the same band/wavelength range as done for the
   individual spaxel data for the
   :class:`~mangadap.proc.reductionassessments.ReductionAssessment`
   object.
 * Using the mean signal from the
   :class:`~mangadap.proc.reductionassessments.ReductionAssessment`
   object, calculate the luminosity-weighted on-sky (``BIN_LWSKYCOO``
   in ``MAPS`` file) and elliptical (``BIN_LWELLCOO`` in ``MAPS``
   file) coordinates. Also calculate the unweighted coordinates;
   the latter are *not* provided in the output ``MAPS`` file.
 * Calculate the area of each bin (``BIN_AREA`` in ``MAPS`` file),
   and the ratio of that area to the expected area (``BIN_FAREA`` in
   ``MAPS`` file) of the binning procedure. The latter is only
   relevant to the radial binning, where the expected area is the
   area of the bin annulus.

 * Apply the Galactic reddening correction to the binned spectra,
   where the reddening law is defined by the ``galactic_reddening``
   and ``galactic_rv`` parameters, and the E(B-V) value is taken from
   the DRP header keyword ``EBVGAL``; see
   :class:`~mangadap.util.extinction.GalacticExtinction`. The valid
   reddening laws are:

    * ``ODonnell``: see
      :func:`~mangadap.util.extinction.reddening_vector_ccm`.
    * ``CCM``: see
      :func:`~mangadap.util.extinction.reddening_vector_ccm`.
    * ``FM``: see :func:`~mangadap.util.extinction.reddening_vector_fm`.
    * ``Calzetti``: see
      :func:`~mangadap.util.extinction.reddening_vector_calzetti`.

.. note::

    Internally, the DAP performs all spectral fitting on the binned
    spectra (termed as such even if a bin only contains a single spaxel)
    *after* they have been corrected for Galactic extinction.
    Therefore, the output emission-line fluxes have been corrected for
    Galactic extinction.  However, the models and binned spectra in the
    output ``LOGCUBE`` file are reverted to their reddened values for
    direct comparison with the DRP ``LOGCUBE`` file.
