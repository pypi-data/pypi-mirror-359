[DIDNOTUSE]
 value = 0
 descr = Pixel was ignored because it was flagged as DONOTUSE or FORESTAR by the DRP, or as LOW_SPECCOV, LOW_SNR, or NONE_IN_STACK in the binning step.
 
[FORESTAR]
 value = 1
 descr = Pixel was ignored because it was flagged as FORESTAR by the DRP.

[LOW_SNR]
 value = 2
 descr = Pixel was ignored because the S/N estimate of the spectrum was below the set threshold; see header keyword ELMMINSN.

[MAIN_EMPTY]
 value = 5
 descr = Line moments not measured because the main passband had no observed fluxes.
 
[BLUE_EMPTY]
 value = 6
 descr = Line moments not measured because the blue passband had no observed fluxes.
 
[RED_EMPTY]
 value = 7
 descr = Line moments not measured because the red passband had no observed fluxes.

[MAIN_INCOMP]
 value = 8
 descr = There were masked fluxes in the main passband.
 
[BLUE_INCOMP]
 value = 9
 descr = There were masked fluxes in the blue passband.
 
[RED_INCOMP]
 value = 10
 descr = There were masked fluxes in the red passband.

[DIVBYZERO]
 value = 11
 descr = Could not compute emission-line moment or its error because of a zero devision.

[NO_ABSORPTION_CORRECTION]
 value = 12
 descr = Moment has not been corrected for underlying absorption because no stellar-continuum model was provided or the model did not cover the necessary spectral range.
 
[MAIN_JUMP]
 value = 13
 descr = Some fraction of, but less than all, the pixels in the main passband were not fit by the stellar-continuum model, meaning the bandpass integral should not be trusted.
 
[BLUE_JUMP]
 value = 14
 descr = Some fraction of, but less than all, the pixels in the blue sideband were not fit by the stellar-continuum model, meaning the bandpass integral should not be trusted.
 
[RED_JUMP]
 value = 15
 descr = Some fraction of, but less than all, the pixels in the red sideband were not fit by the stellar-continuum model, meaning the bandpass integral should not be trusted.

[JUMP_BTWN_SIDEBANDS]
 value = 16
 descr = The stellar-continuum was subtracted from one sideband, but not the other, meaning that the determination of the continuum beneath the line is invalid.

[UNDEFINED_MOM1]
 value = 17
 descr = First moment is undefined, likely because the passband was empty

[UNDEFINED_MOM2]
 value = 18
 descr = Second moment is undefined, likely because it leads to the square-root of a negative number.

[UNDEFINED_BANDS]
 value = 19
 descr = No moments calculated because the bandpasses were not, or improperly, defined.

[NON_POSITIVE_CONTINUUM]
 value = 20
 descr = Equivalent width measurements were not computed because the continuum in either the blue or red sidebands was not positive.
