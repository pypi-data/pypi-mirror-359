[DIDNOTUSE]
 value = 0
 descr = Pixel was ignored because it was flagged as either DONOTUSE or FORESTAR by the data reduction pipeline (DRP).

[FORESTAR]
 value = 1
 descr = Pixel was ignored because it was flagged as FORESTAR by the data reduction pipeline (DRP).

[LOW_SPECCOV]
 value = 2
 descr = Pixel was ignored because the fraction of valid spectral channels limited the spectral coverage below the set threshold; see header keyword FSPECCOV.

[LOW_SNR]
 value = 3
 descr = Pixel was ignored because the S/N estimate of the spectrum was below the set threshold; see header keyword BINMINSN.

[NONE_IN_STACK]
 value = 4
 descr = No valid pixels were available or valid for the stacked spectrum.

[NO_STDDEV]
 value = 5
 descr = Insufficient pixels to calculate the standard deviation in the stacked spectrum.

[IVARINVALID]
 value = 6
 descr = Pixel ignored because inverse variance invalid.
