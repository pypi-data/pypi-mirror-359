[DIDNOTUSE]
 value = 0
 descr = Pixel was ignored because it was flagged as DONOTUSE or FORESTAR by the DRP, or as LOW_SPECCOV, LOW_SNR, or NONE_IN_STACK in the binning step.

[FORESTAR]
 value = 1
 descr = Pixel was ignored because it was flagged as FORESTAR by the DRP.

[LOW_SNR]
 value = 2
 descr = Pixel was ignored because the S/N estimate of the spectrum was below the set threshold; see header keyword SIMINSN.

[ARTIFACT]
 value = 3
 descr = Pixel was ignored during the spectral-index measurements because it was designated as containing an artifact.

[SPECRES_LOW]
 value = 4
 descr = The spectral resolution was *not* matched to the target value because the target value was *higher* than the existing spectral resolution.

# Need to propagate spectral resolution flag to a flag in the index
# measurements!

[NO_MEASUREMENT]
 value = 5
 descr = Nothing measured because of low S/N, missing spectrum, or incomplete bandpass definition.
 
[MAIN_EMPTY]
 value = 6
 descr = Index not measured because the main passband had no observed fluxes.
 
[BLUE_EMPTY]
 value = 7
 descr = Index not measured because the blue passband had no observed fluxes.
 
[RED_EMPTY]
 value = 8
 descr = Index not measured because the red passband had no observed fluxes.

[MAIN_INCOMP]
 value = 9
 descr = There were masked fluxes in the main passband.
 
[BLUE_INCOMP]
 value = 10
 descr = There were masked fluxes in the blue passband.
 
[RED_INCOMP]
 value = 11
 descr = There were masked fluxes in the red passband.

[DIVBYZERO]
 value = 12
 descr = Could not compute index or its error because of a zero devision.  Either the pseudocontinuum in a bandhead computation or the continuum in an absorption-line computation was zero.

[NO_DISPERSION_CORRECTION]
 value = 13
 descr = No dispersion correction was applied to the index because either the template library did not cover this wavelength range or not zero-dispersion model fit was available.

[UNDEFINED_BANDS]
 value = 14
 descr = No index calculated because the bandpasses were not, or improperly, defined.
