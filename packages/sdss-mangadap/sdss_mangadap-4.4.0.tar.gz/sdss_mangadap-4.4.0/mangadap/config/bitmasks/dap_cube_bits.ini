[IGNORED]
 value = 0
 descr = Pixel was ignored because it was flagged as either DONOTUSE or FORESTAR by the DRP, the fraction of valid spectral channels limited the spectral coverage below the set threshold (see FSPECCOV in header), or the S/N estimate of the spectrum was below the binning threshold (see BINMINSN in header).

[FORESTAR]
 value = 1
 descr = Pixel ignored because flagged as FORESTAR by the DRP.

[FLUXINVALID]
 value = 2
 descr = Pixel ignored because no valid (stacked) flux.

[IVARINVALID]
 value = 3
 descr = Pixel ignored because inverse variance invalid.

[ARTIFACT]
 value = 4
 descr = Ignored during fitting - designated as containing an artifact.

[FITIGNORED]
 value = 5
 descr = Ignored by both the stellar-continuum and emission-line fitting algorithms: S/N below the fitting threshold (see SCMINSN and ELFMINSN in header), outside designated spectral range for fit (see FITWAVE in header), contains an emission-line (for stellar-continuum fitting only), limitations of the spectral range and/or accurate convolution of the template spectra, or rejected during fit iterations.

[FITFAILED]
 value = 6
 descr = Stellar-continuum or emission-line fit failed.

[ELIGNORED]
 value = 7
 descr = Ignored by the emission-line fit: S/N below the fitting threshold (see ELFMINSN in header) or outside range of any emission-line fitting window.

[ELFAILED]
 value = 8
 descr = Emission-line fit failed.

[NOMODEL]
 value = 9
 descr = Identifies pixels outside of the fitted spectral range.
