[DIDNOTUSE]
 value = 0
 descr = Pixel was ignored because it was flagged as DONOTUSE or FORESTAR by the DRP, or as LOW_SPECCOV, LOW_SNR, or NONE_IN_STACK in the binning step.
 
[FORESTAR]
 value = 1
 descr = Pixel was ignored because it was flagged as FORESTAR by the DRP.

[LOW_SNR]
 value = 2
 descr = Pixel was ignored because the S/N estimate of the spectrum was below the set threshold; see header keyword ELFMINSN.

[ARTIFACT]
 value = 3
 descr = Pixel was ignored during the emission-line model fit because it was designated as containing an artifact.

[OUTSIDE_RANGE]
 value = 4
 descr = Pixel was ignored during the emission-line model fit because it was outside of any emission-line fitting window.

[NOCONTINUUM]
 value = 5
 descr = Pixel did not have any model of the stellar-continuum subtracted.

# Spectral bits above
# Model parameter bits below
[INSUFFICIENT_DATA]
 value = 6
 descr = There were insufficient data over the relevant wavelength range to fit the line profile(s).

# FIT_FAILED is applied to both model cube and mapped quantities.
[FIT_FAILED]
 value = 7
 descr = Emission-line fit failed according to status returned by scipy.optimize.least_squares.

[NEAR_BOUND]
 value = 8
 descr = Emission-line parameter(s) are within at or near the imposed boundaries in parameter space to within the error of the parameter.

[UNDEFINED_COVAR]
 value = 9
 descr = Emission-line fit resulted in a covariance matrix with negative values along the diagonal, meaning that the formal error is undefined.  (Need to test, but this should mean that the fit is bad.)

[EXCLUDED_FROM_MODEL]
 value = 10
 descr = Emission-line fit excluded from the emission-line flux model because the input emission-line database requested it be one of the lines in the fitting window be excluded or one of the following bits were set: INSUFFICIENT_DATA, FIT_FAILED, NEAR_BOUND, UNDEFINED_COVAR.

[UNDEFINED_SIGMA]
 value = 11
 descr = Emission-line velocity dispersion is undefined because it was found to be smaller than the instrumental dispersion.

[NON_POSITIVE_CONTINUUM]
 value = 12
 descr = Equivalent width measurements were not computed because the continuum in either the blue or red sidebands was not positive.

[NO_FIT]
 value = 13
 descr = Emission-line or spectrum was not fit.

# Spectral bits below
[TPL_PIXELS]
 value = 14
 descr = These pixels were removed to ensure that the number of template spectral pixels was >= the number of fitted object pixels during the stellar-continuum fit.

[TRUNCATED]
 value = 15
 descr = This region was truncated to avoid convolution errors at the edges of the spectral range during the stellar-continuum fit.

[PPXF_REJECT]
 value = 16
 descr = Pixel was rejected during the pPXF fit via the clean parameter.

# Map bits below
[MIN_SIGMA]
 value = 17
 descr = The fitted velocity dispersion is at the minimum allowed by pPXF (1/100th of a pixel)

[BAD_SIGMA]
 value = 18
 descr = Corrected velocity dispersion is below 0 km/s or above 400 km/s

[MAXITER]
 value = 19
 descr = The fit optimizer reached the maximum number of iterations during the fit, which may imply failure to converge.

# Spectral bits below
[INVALID_ERROR]
 value = 20
 descr = Pixel ignored because the flux error was invalid.

[EML_REGION]
 value = 21
 descr = Pixel was ignored during the stellar-continuum fit because it contains an emission-line.
