[NO_DATA]
 value = 0
 descr = Pixel has no data

[WAVE_INVALID]
 value = 1
 descr = Used to designate pixels in the 1D spectra that are outside the valid wavelength range defined by default_template_libraries().

[FLUX_INVALID]
 value = 2
 descr = Used to designate pixels in the 1D spectra that are below the valid flux limit defined by default_template_libraries().

[SPECRES_EXTRAP]
 value = 3
 descr = The spectral resolution has been matched to a value that was an extrapolation of the target spectral resolution samples.

[SPECRES_LOW]
 value = 4
 descr = The spectral resolution was *not* matched to the target value because the target value was *higher* than the existing spectral resolution.

[SPECRES_2PIXEL]
 value = 5
 descr = Resampling has lead to the resolution being below the two pixel limit.  The spectral resolution has been changed to be exactly the two pixel limit for these pixels.

[SPECRES_NOFLUX]
 value = 6
 descr = Resolution matching has lead a template flux <= 0.
