# Columns in the parameter files with a given absorption-index bandpass
# filter database are:
#
#   INDEX:      
#       Unique integer identifier of the absorption index.
#   NAME:
#       Name of the index, read as a string.
#   PRIMARY:   
#       A two-element vector with the starting and ending wavelength for
#       the primary bandpass surrounding the absorption feature(s).
#   BLUESIDE:   
#       A two-element vector with the starting and ending wavelength for
#       a bandpass to the blue of the primary band.  Used to set the
#       continuum level near the absorption feature(s).
#   REDSIDE:
#       A two-element vector with the starting and ending wavelength for
#       a bandpass to the red of the primary band.  Used to set the
#       continuum level near the absorption feature(s).
#   WAVEREF:
#       Set the reference frame of the wavelengths provided to be in
#       either air or vacuum using the keywords 'air' or 'vac',
#       respectively.
#   UNITS:
#       Units for the absorption index, which must be either 'ang' or
#       'mag'.
#   COMPONENT:
#       Binary flag (0-false,1-true) that the index is a component of a
#       composite index.  If true (1), all components with the same NAME
#       are added together to form the composite index.
