# Columns in the parameter files with a given bandhead-index bandpass
# filter database are:
#
#   INDEX:      
#       Unique integer identifier of the bandhead.
#   NAME:
#       Name of the index, read as a string.
#   BLUESIDE:   
#       A two-element vector with the starting and ending wavelength for
#       a bandpass toward the blue of the bandhead feature.
#   REDSIDE:
#       A two-element vector with the starting and ending wavelength for
#       a bandpass toward the red of the bandhead feature.
#   WAVEREF:
#       Set the reference frame of the wavelengths provided to be in
#       either air or vacuum using the keywords 'air' or 'vac',
#       respectively.
#   INTEGRAND:
#       Integrand within the passband for the construction of the index,
#       which must be either 'fnu' or 'flambda'.
#   ORDER:
#       Define the order to use when constructing the index.  The
#       options are either a ratio of red-to-blue or blue-to-red, which
#       are respectively selected using 'r_b' or 'b_r'.
