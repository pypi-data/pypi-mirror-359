THIS README DESCRIBES THE FILES CONTAINING THE STELLAR POPULATION MODELS
OF MARASTON & STROMBACK (2011, MNRAS). MODELS ARE AVAILABLE AT
WWW.MARASTON.EU/M11/.
 
These models have the same stellar energetics and atmospheric parameters
as the standard Maraston (2005, M05) models. The difference is in the
individual stellar spectra that are assigned to the various synthetic
stars according to their effective temperatures and gravities (Teff and
log). These spectra can be either empirical or theoretical, and in some
cases a mixture of them. 

In particular, the empirically-based models have been extended in
wavelength coverage into the UV, using the high-resolution models
published in Maraston et al. (2009, 493, 425), which are based on the
theoretical spectral library UVBLUE (Rodrigues-Merino et al. 2005). This
extension was made at various metallicities in case of the MILES-based
models, and at solar metallicity for STELIB and ELODIE.  The UV-extended
models will be indicated using the addition 'UVextended' to the file
name (see below).

We also provide a version of the Pickles-based models, which extend to
the UV, using the models with the theoretical UV. In this case since is
not an extension we call then 'UVtheoretical'.

In general, models should be chosen according to the spectral resolution
that is needed by observations, though differences induced by the use of
different spectral libraries exist.  See the paper for a description or
contact the authors. 

GENERAL NAMING:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ssp_M11'_'library'_'any eventual extension'.'imf''zxxx'.'HB morphology': 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * 'ssp_M11': Simple Stellar Populations by Maraston & Stromback  2011

  * 'library': reference to the adopted stellar library, e.g. Pickles,
    MILES, STELIB, ELODIE,   MARCS, see below for a detailed
    description.                    
  
  * 'any eventual extension': it refers to whether the models have been
                              extended in wavelength coverage by merging
                              with other models or have been revised
                              with respect to the original library.
                              Cases are:

     'UVextended': models extended into the UV by merging with
                   theoretically-based SSPs

     'UVtheoretical': only for Pickles-based models. The Pickles-based
                      UV as been substituted with the theoretical UV
     'nearIRextended': 
     'revisednearIRslope': only for MILES-based models of solar
                           metallicity. The slope of the models longward
                           6000 AA has been slightly revised as
                           described in the Appendix of the paper.

  * 'imf': Initial Mass Funcion,IMF, namely:

    '.ss' ==> Salpeter IMF
    '.kr' ==> Kroupa IMF
    '.cha' ==> Chabrier IMF

    (Other IMFs could be obtained contacting the authors)

  * 'zxxx': chemical composition, as it follows (notation identical to
            M05)

     z10m4=0.0001
     z0001=0.001
     z001=0.01
     z002=0.02 (solar metallicity)
     z004=0.04  

  *  'Horizontal Branch morphology': following the notation of M05 this
                                     can be rhb=intermediate-red and
                                     bhb=intermediate-blue. Relevant to
                                     sub-solar metallicities.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
MILES-BASED MODELS: These models are based on the stellar library MILES
                    by Sanchez-Blazquez et al. (2006).

                  * A few cool, high-resolution theoretical stars
                    (Gustafsson et al. 2008) have been added for
                    completeness.

                  * Fairly poor sampling of stellar parameter space at
                    the lowest metallicity may affect the reliability of
                    these models.

                  * We make two versions of solar metallicity models,
                    one based on the MILES library as it is, and another
                    one in which we revised the slope longward 6000
                    based on the finding that the slope of the MILES
                    stellar spectra at the  reddest lambdas is steeper
                    (i.e. less flux) than the one of other libraries,
                    which we figured out to be related to the assumed
                    temperature calibration for RGB stars in    MILES
                    (Maraston & Stromback 2011). This manipulated model
                    version is indicated as 'revised'. Its merit with
                    respect to the standard model      needs to be
                    assessed through comparison with data (future work).

                  * The actual spectral resolution of MILES has been
                    determined in Beifiori et al. 2011, arXiv:1012.3428
