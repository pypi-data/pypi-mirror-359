MILES-AVG STELLAR LIBRARY
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library is based on the MILES template library.  For a description
of the MILES library, see:

../miles/README

This library was created as follows:

    - Remove any templates with placeholder logT, logg, and [Fe/H]
      values in ../miles/MILES_params.db.

    - Ignore spectrum m0970.

    - Divide the full range in logT, logg, and [Fe/H] into a 12x12x12 3D
      grid and determine which templates fall in which grid cell.

    - For each grid cell with >1 templates, average the flux from those
      templates into a single, new template.

The library then consists of these new average templates, and any
template that was the sole occupant of its logT, logg, [Fe/H] grid cell.
Information is provided in the header of each fits file giving the
wavelength solution, the mean (logT,logg,[Fe/H]) location, the
definition of the bin edges, and the file names of the MILES spectra
used to create each template.

This library consists of 219 templates spanning the full range of
stellar parameters provided by the MILES library.
