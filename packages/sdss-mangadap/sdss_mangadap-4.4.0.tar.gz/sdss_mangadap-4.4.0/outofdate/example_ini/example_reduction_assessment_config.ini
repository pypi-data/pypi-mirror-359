# Configuration file for a S/N calculation for use by the MaNGA Data
# Analysis Pipeline.  Some keywords can be commented out or left
# undefined.

# ! OPTIONAL !: Define the root path that contains the DAP source code;
# this can be used below to define paths to either a parameter file with
# a set of bands to use for the S/N calculation or a file with a
# response function to use to weight the S/N calculation.  If not
# provided, the 'par_file' and 'response_function_file' parameters must
# be a complete (and valid) path to the file.

# ! OPTIONAL ! (Default: False): Set a flag that the wavelengths listed
# above or in one of the provided files are in vacuum (True) or air
# (False)

# ! OPTIONAL ! (Default: None): Set how the covariance in the signal
# over the provided wavelength range is to be calculated.  The options
# are:
#
#   - False - Covariance is ignored; only the diagonal of the covariance
#   matrix is calculated.
#
#   - True - The formal correlation matrix is calculated for the central
#   wavelength channel only.
