Click [here](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SEK-SCD41) to learn more about the Sensirion SCD4X sensor family.


Not all sensors of this driver family support all measurements.
In case a measurement is not supported by all sensors, the products that
support it are listed in the API description.



## Supported sensor types

| Sensor name   | I²C Addresses  |
| ------------- | -------------- |
|[SCD40](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SCD40)| **0x62**|
|[SCD41](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SCD41)| **0x62**|
|[SCD43](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SCD43)| **0x62**|

The following instructions and examples use a *SCD41*.



## Connect the sensor

You can connect your sensor over a [SEK-SensorBridge](https://developer.sensirion.com/product-support/sek-sensorbridge/).
For special setups you find the sensor pinout in the section below.
