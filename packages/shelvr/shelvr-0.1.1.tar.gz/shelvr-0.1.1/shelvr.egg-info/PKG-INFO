# 🌳 SHELVR — File Organizer CLI

`shelvr` is a safe, extensible command-line tool written in Python for organizing files by type. 
It supports recursive operations, dry runs, logging, and CLI flags for customizable behavior.
Currently adding undo , batches and many other features also so keep following 

-----

## ✨ Features

  * Organizes files into folders by type (e.g., `Pictures`, `Documents`, `Videos`, etc.)
  * **Dry run mode** (preview changes without moving files)
  * **Recursive subdirectory processing** (`--recursive`)
  * **Verbosity control** (`--verbose`, `--quiet`)
  * **Console + file logging**
  * **Safe path checks** to prevent accidental system-wide changes
  * **Easily extensible** (add custom file types or logic)

Once published on PyPI:

```bash
pip install shelvr
```

Or install locally:
