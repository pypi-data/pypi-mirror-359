**SigKit** is a modular digital signal‚Äêprocessing toolkit built on top of NumPy. It has additive impairments to simulate OTA impairments. We include a full Machine Learning toolkit with methods for PyTorch designed for training Modulation Classification Models that are capable of generalizing over the air (OTA). It provides:

- **Core abstractions** (`Signal`, `Impairment`, `Modem`, ‚Ä¶) for working in complex baseband
- **NumPy ipairments,  PyTorch Transforms & tools** (AWGN, fading, filtering, SNR & BER calculators)
- **PyTorch Transforms** so you can drop signal operations straight into `Compose`
- **PyTorch Lightning Pipeline** includes our pretrained model and methods for retraining
- **(WIP) GNURadio Blocks** wrapping our tools
- **Synthetic data generators** & `torch.utils.data.Dataset` classes

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Try the example notebook
A quick way to explore SigKit is to run the Jupyter notebook in:
```
examples/notebooks/basic.ipynb
```

The notebook is a guide that covers:
- Generating a signal with a Modem
- Adding an Impairment like AWGN
- Calculating Signal Metrics
- Visualizing the waveform
> Be sure to restart your notebook's kernel after installing the package.

### Classification
There is also an example notebook for running the pretrained model.
```
examples/notebooks/classification.ipynb
```
> Pull down LFS objects first with `git lfs pull`


## Installing SigKit

### Package Installation
##### Installing the [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/sigkit/) package
```bash
pip install sigkit
```

##### Installing from source (recommended for ML tasks)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IsaiahHarvi/SigKit.git
cd SigKit
pip install -e .
```

##### Sanity Check for source installs
You can be gauranteeed your installation is sound by running `pytest` without failure from the root of the repository.

### (Optional) DevContainer for VS Code

If you use VS Code and would prefer to isolate your SigKit installation, we‚Äôve provided a DevContainer in the repository.
It is designed to be OS agnostic but it is confirmed to support: `Ubunutu >22.04, ARM MacOS, Windows`

To setup:
1. Install the **Remote ‚Äì Containers** extension in VS Code.
2. Clone, open the project, and run `chmod +x .devcontainer/setup.sh`.
3. Run **Reopen in Container** from the VSCode console.

Inside the container you‚Äôll have all dependencies installed and SigKit ready to run.
