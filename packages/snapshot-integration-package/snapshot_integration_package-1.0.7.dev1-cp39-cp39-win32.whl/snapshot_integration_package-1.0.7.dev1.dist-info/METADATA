## [1.0.6] - 2025-06-20
### Added
- all being added machines are now being updated with original Qgen, Qmax and Qmin limits (due to being out of serrvice, machines Qlimits were orverwritten by a garbage value during load flow).
- automation now generates txt file in parent directory folders of the case to be added for the unsolved and/or unattempted generating system. those generating systems should be resolved manually.
