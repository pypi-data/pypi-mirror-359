        This function quickly finds clear days in a PV power data set. The input to this function is a 2D array containing
        standardized time series power data. This will typically be the output from
        `solardatatools.data_transforms.make_2d`. The filter relies on two estimates of daily "clearness": the smoothness
        of each daily signal as measured by the l2-norm of the 2nd order difference, and seasonally-adjusted daily
        energy. Seasonal adjustment of the daily energy if obtained by solving a local quantile regression problem, which
        is a convex optimization problem and is solvable with cvxpy. The parameter `th` controls the relative weighting of
        the daily smoothness and daily energy in the final filter in a geometric mean. A value of 0 will rely entirely on
        the daily energy and a value of 1 will rely entirely on daily smoothness.

        :param D: A 2D numpy array containing a solar power time series signal.
        :param th: A parameter that tunes the filter between relying of daily smoothness and daily energy
        :return: A 1D boolean array, with `True` values corresponding to clear days in the data set
