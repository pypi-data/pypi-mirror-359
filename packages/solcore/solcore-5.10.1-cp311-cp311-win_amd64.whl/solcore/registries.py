"""Registries are dictionaries that put together Solcore's functionality that share the
same purpose, eg. calculate solar cell properties, solve the electrical properties of
junctions or solve their optical properties. They can also perform validation and be
used to extend Solcore's functionality without the need of modifying the source code.

The main advantage of registries is that they allow you to define your own functionality
outside of the solcore code base, simplifying the process of trying new things:

>>> from solcore import registries
>>> @registries.register_action("pre-process")
... def pre_process_cell(*args, **kwargs):
...     pass
>>> "pre-process" in registries.ACTIONS_REGISTRY
True

After this, `pre-process` will be one of the `task` that you can run when executing the
`solar_cell_solver` funciton.

You can also overwrite existing functionality in case you want to implement your own
alternative to an existing approach:

>>> from solcore import registries
>>> @registries.register_action("optics", overwrite=True)
... def custom_solve_optics(*args, **kwargs):
...     pass
>>> registries.ACTIONS_REGISTRY["optics"] == custom_solve_optics
True
