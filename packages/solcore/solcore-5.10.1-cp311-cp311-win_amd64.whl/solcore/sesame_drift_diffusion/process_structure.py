    """
    Process the layers in the junction and convert it to a format which can be used by Sesame. This includes unit
    conversions from Solcore base SI units to the units used by Sesame (eV, cm). This function also sets the mesh,
    either from a user-supplied junction.mesh (in m) attribute, or by trying to guess an appropriate mesh depending on the
    doping profile and layer thicknesses. It will also extract the doping profile, which can be supplied in
    the following formats:

        - a constant value for each layer, set by the Nd or Na attribute of the material
        - a doping profile for the whole junction, passed as a function which accepts a depth in the junction in m
          and returns doping in m-3
        - a doping profile for each layer, passed as a function which accepts a depth in the layer in m and returns
          doping in m-3
        - Combinations of the above

    Note that since we can specify a doping profile for the whole junction, the Sesame solver can support a junction
    which is made up of a single layer, unlike the depletion approximation and Fortran-based PDD solvers.

    This function will add or update the following attributes in the Junction object:

        - mesh: the mesh used by the Sesame solver, in m
        - mesh_cm: the mesh used by the Sesame solver, in cm
        - sesame_sys: a Sesame Builder object defining the junction in Sesame format, used to solve the IV and QE

    Extract approriate surface recombination velocities for Sesame from a Junction object.
    The labelling sn and sp in the junction object refers to the doping of the region, NOT the
    carrier type. For the Sesame solver, it is also possible to specify the recombination velocities
    for the carrier types separately in the defintion of the Junction as sn_e/sn_h, sp_e/sp_h,
    being respectively the electron/hole SRVs in the n-type region and the electron/hole SRVs in the
    p_type region. Note that the majority carrier surface recombination (sn_e and sp_h) generally
    do not affect the solution.
