    It also prepares the structure for further calculations. The external data that must
    be provided in the solar cell definition is:

    - external_reflected: a function that provides the fraction of reflected light at
      the specified wavelengths (in m).
    - external_absorbed: a function that provides an array with the differential
      absorption at a depth Z (in m) at the specified wavelengths.

    Note that both are functions of a single variable - wavelength in the first case and
    position in the second - and that the latter provides as output an array at the
    wavelengths indicated in the options.

        - solar_cell: A solar_cell object
