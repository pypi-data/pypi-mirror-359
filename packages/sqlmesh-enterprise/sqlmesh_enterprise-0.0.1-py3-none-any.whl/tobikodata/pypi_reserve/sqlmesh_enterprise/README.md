## SQLMesh Enterprise Package

SQLMesh Enterprise is distributed as a private package and is not available on PyPI.
It is installed automatically when using [tcloud](https://pypi.org/project/tcloud/).
This package is needed to avoid a third party from hosting a package on pypi with the same name/version as the SQLMesh Enterprise package and having users accidentally install it.
