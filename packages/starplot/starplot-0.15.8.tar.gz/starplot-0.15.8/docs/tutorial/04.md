The zenith star chart is known as a [perspective projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)), which means it depends on a time and place. They're useful for many things in astronomy, but Starplot also lets you create general-purpose maps of the sky that are independent of location (well, technically they still assume you're *somewhere* on Earth ðŸ˜†).

For example, here's how you can create a map that shows the area around Orion:

<div class="tutorial" markdown>
```python linenums="1"
--8<-- "tutorial/tutorial_04.py"
```
</div>

*In the [next section](05.md), we'll learn how to create an optic plot which shows an area of the sky when viewed through an optic (such as binoculars or a telescope)...*
