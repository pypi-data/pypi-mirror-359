# Current Limitations and Roadmap

This document outlines the current limitations of Mojo and MAX in the Community Edition, along with known roadmap items.

## Mojo Language Limitations

### 1. Missing Language Features

**Classes**
- No Python-style dynamic classes yet
- Only static structs are available
- Workaround: Use structs with traits

**Async/Await**
- No native async support
- Workaround: Use Python's asyncio through interop

**Decorators**
- Limited decorator support
- Available: `@export`, `@fieldwise_init`, `@parameter`
- Missing: Custom decorators

**Exception Handling**
- Basic try/except support
- No custom exception types yet
- Limited exception information

### 2. Standard Library Gaps

**Missing Modules**
- No native HTTP client
- Limited file I/O (use Python interop)
- No JSON parser (use Python's json)
- No regex support (use Python's re)
- No database drivers

**Collections**
- Basic List and Dict support
- No OrderedDict, defaultdict, etc.
- Limited set operations

### 3. Python Interop Limitations

**Calling Mojo from Python**
- Max 3 arguments for regular functions
- No keyword arguments (dict workaround needed)
- No direct `__init__` binding
- No static methods or properties
- Limited type conversions

**Performance Overhead**
- Boundary crossing has cost
- Type conversions can be expensive
- Not all NumPy operations are optimized

## MAX Inference Limitations

### 1. Model Support

**Model Formats**
- Best support for GGUF format
- PyTorch models need conversion
- Some models may not work out-of-box

**Model Types**
- Focus on transformer architectures
- Limited support for custom architectures
- Some specialized layers unsupported

### 2. Hardware Support

**Community Edition Limits**
- Up to 8 non-NVIDIA GPUs
- No TPU support
- Limited ARM optimization

**GPU Features**
- NVIDIA has best support
- AMD support is newer/limited
- No Intel GPU support yet

### 3. Serving Features

**Missing Features**
- No built-in model versioning
- Limited A/B testing support
- No automatic model reloading
- Basic metrics only

**Scaling Limitations**
- Manual scaling configuration
- No auto-scaling out of box
- Limited load balancing options

## Development Environment

### 1. Tooling

**IDE Support**
- Basic VSCode extension
- No IntelliJ/PyCharm plugin
- Limited debugging support
- No profiler integration

**Package Management**
- No native package manager
- Manual dependency handling
- No private package registry

### 2. Documentation

**API Docs**
- Some APIs undocumented
- Examples still being added
- Community docs emerging

**Tutorials**
- Limited advanced tutorials
- Few real-world examples
- More samples needed

## Platform Limitations

### 1. Operating Systems

**Current Support**
- Linux (best support)
- macOS (good support)
- Windows (WSL only)

**Missing**
- Native Windows support
- Mobile platforms
- Embedded systems

### 2. Deployment

**Container Limitations**
- Large container size
- No official Helm charts
- Limited orchestration examples

**Edge Deployment**
- Not optimized for edge
- Large binary size
- High memory requirements

## Known Issues

### 1. Performance

**CPU Performance**
- Some operations not vectorized
- Limited SIMD usage in places
- Thread scaling issues

**Memory Usage**
- Higher than expected for some models
- Memory leaks in edge cases
- Inefficient caching

### 2. Stability

**Beta Features**
- Python interop is beta
- May have breaking changes
- Some crashes possible

**Error Messages**
- Sometimes cryptic
- Stack traces can be unclear
- Limited error recovery

## Roadmap Items

### Near Term (Likely 2025)

1. **Mojo Improvements**
   - Python-style classes
   - Better error handling
   - More standard library

2. **MAX Enhancements**
   - More model formats
   - Better quantization
   - Improved serving features

3. **Platform Support**
   - Native Windows
   - Better ARM support
   - Smaller binaries

### Medium Term

1. **Language Features**
   - Async/await support
   - Custom decorators
   - Better metaprogramming

2. **Ecosystem**
   - Package manager
   - More integrations
   - Better tooling

### Long Term Vision

1. **Full Python Compatibility**
   - Run any Python code
   - Better performance
   - Seamless integration

2. **Universal Deployment**
   - Mobile support
   - Edge optimization
   - WebAssembly target

## Workarounds and Tips

### 1. Missing Features

**Use Python Interop**
```mojo
# For missing stdlib features
var json = Python.import_module("json")
var requests = Python.import_module("requests")
```

**Community Packages**
- Check [GitHub](https://github.com/modular/modular-community)
- Join [Discord](https://discord.gg/modular) for help
- Share your solutions

### 2. Performance Issues

**Profile First**
- Identify actual bottlenecks
- Don't premature optimize
- Use Python for non-critical paths

**Batch Operations**
- Minimize boundary crossing
- Process in chunks
- Reuse allocations

### 3. Stability Problems

**Defensive Coding**
```mojo
try:
    # Potentially unstable operation
    result = risky_operation()
except:
    # Fallback to Python
    result = python_fallback()
```

## Summary

While Mojo and MAX have limitations, they offer:

1. **Significant Performance**: Often 10-100x faster than Python
2. **Growing Ecosystem**: Rapid development and improvements
3. **Strong Community**: Active and helpful
4. **Clear Vision**: Becoming the best AI infrastructure

Most limitations have workarounds, and the roadmap addresses key gaps. The Community Edition provides everything needed for serious development and deployment.

For production use cases hitting these limits, consider:
- Using Python interop for missing features
- Joining the community for solutions
- Considering Enterprise Edition for advanced needs
- Contributing feedback to shape the roadmap

Remember: Mojo is young but rapidly evolving. What's a limitation today might be solved tomorrow!
