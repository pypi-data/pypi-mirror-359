## 📶 Available Priorities
The available task priorities are:

## 💡 Tips

- Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate through your command history.
- TaskMan supports auto-completion. Start typing a command and press Tab to complete it.
- If a task is passed without specifying the priority (e.g: ```add code```) the priority will default to medium 
- Your tasks can be saved, so you can safely exit with saving the current state and resume your work later.
