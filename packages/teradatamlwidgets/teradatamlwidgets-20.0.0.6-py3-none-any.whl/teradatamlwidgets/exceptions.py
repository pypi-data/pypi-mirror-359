class TeradataNotebookException(Exception):
    """
    Teradata Notebook Exception class.
    All public functions and methods should only raise TeradataNotebookException so that
    application code need only catch TeradataNotebookException.
    Public functions and methods should use the following form

        try:
            # do something useful
        except TeradataNotebookError:
            # re-raise a TeradataNotebookException that was raised by one of our internal functions.
            raise
        exception Exception as err:
            # all other exceptions (like driver exceptions) are wrapped in a TeradataNotebookException
            raise TeradataNotebookException(msg) from err

    Both public and internal functions should raise TeradataNotebookException for any
    application errors like invalid argument.

    For example:
        if key is not in columnnames:
            raise TeradataNotebookException(msg)


    Internal functions should let other exceptions from the driver bubble up.
    If internal functions would like to do something in a try: except: block like logging,
    then it should use the form

        try:
            # do something useful
        except:
            logger.log ("log something useful")
            # re-raise the error so that it is caught by the calling public function.
            # the calling public function will take care of wrapping the exception in TeradataNotebookError
            # this will avoid a lot of unnecessary exception handling code.
            raise

    If TeradataNotebookException was the result of another exception, then the
    attribute __cause__ will be set with the root cause exception.
