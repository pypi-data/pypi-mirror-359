    DESCRIPTION:
        Shows plot for multiple teradatamlwidgets in a subplot layout.

    PARAMETERS:
        plots: 
            Specifies the plots to be combined.
            Type: list of teradatamlwidgets.plot.Ui instances

        nrows:
            Optional Argument. 
            Required when grid argument is not provided.
            SSpecifies the number of coumns to have in combined plot.
            Type: int

        ncols:
            Optional Argument. 
            Optional Argument. Required when ncols argument is provided.
            Specifies the number of rows to have in combined plot.
            Type: int

        grid: 
            Optional Argument. Required when nrows and ncols arguments are not provided. 
            Specifies the grid to place the subplots.
            In grids dictionary, the key is a pair x and y subplot location and the value is the pair relative width cell and relative height cell representing the sublot size in units.

    RETURNS:
        None

    EXAMPLES:
        ShowPlots(plots, nrows=2, ncols=2)
        ShowPlots(plots, grid = {(1, 1): (1, 1), (1, 2): (1, 1), (2, 1): (1, 2)})
