# tfwaves
TFWaves is a python package to compute fast time-frequency gravitational-wave response for LISA data analysis. It takes as imput phase and amplitude functions of the gravitational strain in the pseudo-inertial solar system barycenter frame, and outputs time-delay interferometry responses in the time-frequency domain.
