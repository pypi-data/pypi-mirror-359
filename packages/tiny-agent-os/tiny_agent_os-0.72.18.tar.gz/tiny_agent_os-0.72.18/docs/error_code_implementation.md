# Error Code Implementation and Test Improvements

## Summary

We improved the error handling system for the tinyAgent framework by implementing formal error codes in the `AgentRetryExceeded` exception and creating more focused test cases to validate both successful and failed agent operations.

## Key Changes

### 1. Error Codes in AgentRetryExceeded

Added formal error codes to the `AgentRetryExceeded` exception to better categorize failure types:

- `ERR_NO_VALID_TOOL`: When the agent can't find an appropriate tool for a query
- `ERR_INVALID_RESPONSE_FORMAT`: When the LLM response format is incorrect
- `ERR_PARSING_FAILED`: When parsing the response fails
- `ERR_TOOL_EXECUTION_FAILED`: When a tool fails during execution
- `ERR_HTTP_ERROR`: When HTTP errors occur during API calls (common with 404s for unsupported models)
- `ERR_API_REQUEST`: For other API request errors
- `ERR_UNKNOWN`: Fallback for unspecified errors

The exception now automatically determines the most appropriate error code by analyzing the retry history.

### 2. HTTP Error Handling

Enhanced the agent's `run` method to catch HTTP errors and convert them to `AgentRetryExceeded` exceptions with appropriate error codes. This addresses a key issue where HTTP 404 errors from the OpenRouter API (particularly for models that don't support certain functionality) weren't being properly caught and handled.

### 3. Test Improvements

Created more focused test cases:

1. **Basic Tool Function Test**: Direct validation that the `calculate_sum` tool works correctly
2. **Agent Integration Test**: Comprehensive testing that the agent correctly extracts parameters from natural language and returns expected results
3. **Error Handling Test**: Updated to catch both `AgentRetryExceeded` and `HTTPError` exceptions

## Issues Found

1. **HTTP 404 Errors**: Discovered that OpenRouter returns 404 errors for models that don't support structured outputs, causing tests to fail with HTTPError instead of AgentRetryExceeded.

2. **Retry Mechanism Gaps**: The original error handling didn't properly catch HTTP errors before they propagated to the test. This caused inconsistent test failures depending on how the model responded.

3. **Error Classification**: There was no formal way to classify different types of failures, making it difficult to programmatically handle specific error conditions.

4. **Test Clarity**: Original tests were too broad, testing multiple aspects at once without clear focus on what was being verified.

## Lessons Learned

1. API interactions should always have comprehensive error handling that wraps all possible exceptions into application-specific ones with clear error codes.

2. Tests should have a clear focus, testing one specific aspect of functionality at a time for easier debugging.

3. Error codes provide significant value for both programmatic error handling and human debugging.

4. The agent's retry mechanism should be more comprehensive, catching all types of errors during LLM interactions.

## Next Steps

1. Consider extending error codes to other exception types in the framework for consistency.

2. Add more specialized test cases for specific error conditions.

3. Improve documentation to include error code meanings and troubleshooting steps.

4. Consider adding telemetry to track the most common error codes for future improvements.
