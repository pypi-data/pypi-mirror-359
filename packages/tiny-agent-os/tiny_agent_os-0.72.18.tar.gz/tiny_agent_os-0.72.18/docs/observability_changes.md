# Observability Feature Development Changes

This document summarizes the key code changes made to implement the OpenTelemetry-based observability (tracing) feature in tinyAgent.

## 1. Dependencies (`pyproject.toml`)

- Added necessary OpenTelemetry packages to the `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` section:
  - `opentelemetry-api`
  - `opentelemetry-sdk`
  - `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp` (for OTLP export; default is `console`)

## 2. Configuration (`config.yml`)

- Added a new top-level `observability` section.
- Within `observability`, added a `tracing` subsection with keys:
  - `enabled`: Master switch for tracing.
  - `service_name`: Identifier for the service.
  - `sampling_rate`: Controls the fraction of traces kept.
  - `exporter`: Defines how traces are exported (`console` or `otlp`).
  - `attributes`: Key-value pairs added to all spans (e.g., `environment`, `version`).

## 3. Observability Module (`src/tinyagent/observability/`)

- Created a new package `src/tinyagent/observability`.
- **`tracer.py`**:
  - Provides `configure_tracing()` and `get_tracer()` for automatic, idempotent tracing setup.
  - Supports both `console` and `otlp` exporters, and respects the `enabled` flag.

## 4. Agent Integration (`src/tinyagent/agent.py`)

- **Key Design:** Tracing is implemented at the agent level through the `TracedAgent` class.
- The `TracedAgent` class:
  - Inherits from `Agent`
  - Uses the `@trace_agent_run` decorator on its `run` method
  - Overrides `execute_tool_call` to add tracing for tool executions
- This provides a single, consistent trace for each agent execution, including all tool calls and internal logic.
- Example usage:

  ```python
  # Create an agent with tracing enabled
  agent = tiny_agent(tools=[my_tool], trace_this_agent=True)  # Returns TracedAgent instance

  # Create an agent without tracing
  agent = tiny_agent(tools=[my_tool])  # Returns base Agent instance
  ```

## 5. Testing (`tests/`)

- Tests use the agent-level tracing by creating `TracedAgent` instances when needed.
- No explicit test-level tracing setup is required.
- The `trace_this_agent` flag controls whether tracing is enabled for each agent instance.

## 6. Summary of Implementation Evolution

1. **Initial Approach (Deprecated)**:

   - Used tool-level and test-level decorators
   - Individual tools were traced separately
   - Required more setup and maintenance

2. **Current Approach**:
   - Agent-level tracing through `TracedAgent`
   - Comprehensive tracing of entire agent execution flow
   - Simpler, more maintainable implementation
   - Cleaner separation between traced and untraced agents
   - Tool executions are traced as part of the agent's trace
