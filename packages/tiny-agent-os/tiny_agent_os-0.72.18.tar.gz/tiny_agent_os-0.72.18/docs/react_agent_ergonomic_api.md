# ReactAgent Ergonomic API Improvements

**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED - Inspired by smolagents

## Summary

Successfully implemented ergonomic improvements to ReactAgent API, making it cleaner and more intuitive for users. The changes were inspired by smolagents' approach while maintaining tinyAgent's philosophy.

## What We Accomplished

### 1. **Cleaner Imports**

**Before:**
```python
from tinyagent.decorators import tool
from tinyagent.react.react_agent import ReactAgent
```

**After:**
```python
from tinyagent import tool, ReactAgent
```

**Implementation:** Updated `src/tinyagent/__init__.py` to export ReactAgent at package level.

### 2. **Ergonomic Tool Registration**

**Before:**
```python
agent = ReactAgent()
agent.register_tool(calculate_percentage._tool)
agent.register_tool(subtract_numbers._tool)
```

**After:**
```python
agent = ReactAgent(tools=[calculate_percentage, subtract_numbers])
```

**Key Features:**
- Pass tools directly in constructor
- Automatic handling of different tool types:
  - Decorated functions (most common)
  - Raw Tool objects
  - Plain functions (auto-converted)
- Flexible processing in `__post_init__`

### 3. **Simplified API**

**Before:**
```python
result = agent.run_react(query, max_steps=5)
```

**After:**
```python
result = agent.run(query, max_steps=5)
```

**Implementation:** Added `run()` as an alias for `run_react()` for better ergonomics.

### 4. **Improved Tool Registration Method**

Enhanced `register_tool()` to accept any tool type:
```python
def register_tool(self, tool: Any) -> None:
    """Register a tool with the agent.
    
    Args:
        tool: Can be a Tool object, a decorated function with ._tool attribute,
              or a plain function that will be converted to a tool.
    """
```

### 5. **Optional Base Tools**

Added `add_base_tools` parameter to control built-in tools:
```python
# With final_answer tool (default)
agent = ReactAgent(tools=[...])

# Without final_answer tool
agent = ReactAgent(tools=[...], add_base_tools=False)
```

## Files Modified

### Core Changes
- `src/tinyagent/__init__.py` - Added ReactAgent export
- `src/tinyagent/react/react_agent.py` - Implemented ergonomic features
- `README.md` - Simplified from 294 to 132 lines

### Examples Updated
- `examples/react_minimal.py` - Created clean minimal example
- `examples/react_phase2.py` - Updated to use new API
- `examples/react_ergonomic.py` - Created to showcase all features

### Tests
- `tests/08_react_agent_test.py` - Updated to use clean imports
- `tests/09_react_minimal_test.py` - Created comprehensive test suite

## Technical Implementation Details

### Tool Processing in Constructor
```python
# Process tools if they were passed as decorated functions
processed_tools = []
for tool in self.tools:
    if hasattr(tool, '_tool'):
        # This is a decorated function, extract the Tool object
        processed_tools.append(tool._tool)
    elif isinstance(tool, Tool):
        # This is already a Tool object
        processed_tools.append(tool)
    else:
        # Try to convert it to a tool
        from ..decorators import tool as tool_decorator
        decorated = tool_decorator(tool)
        processed_tools.append(decorated._tool)
```

### Test Support
Added `llm_callable` parameter to `run()` and `run_react()` for testing:
```python
def run(self, query: str, max_steps: Optional[int] = None, llm_callable: Optional[callable] = None) -> str:
    """Run the agent with the given query. Alias for run_react for better ergonomics."""
    return self.run_react(query, max_steps, llm_callable)
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Better Developer Experience**
   - Cleaner imports reduce cognitive load
   - Intuitive API matches modern Python libraries
   - Less boilerplate code

2. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Old API still works
   - `register_tool()` method enhanced but not broken
   - `run_react()` still available

3. **Flexibility**
   - Multiple ways to register tools
   - Optional base tools
   - Support for testing with mock LLMs

## Minimal Example

The new API enables ultra-concise agent creation:
```python
from tinyagent import tool, ReactAgent

@tool
def multiply(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Multiply two numbers together."""
    return a * b

@tool
def divide(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Divide the first number by the second number."""
    return a / b

agent = ReactAgent(tools=[multiply, divide])
result = agent.run("What is 12 times 5, then divided by 3?")
# â†’ 20
```

## Inspiration

These improvements were inspired by smolagents' clean API:
```python
# smolagents style
agent = CodeAgent(tools=[WebSearchTool()], model=model)
agent.run("How many seconds would it take...")
```

We adapted this pattern while maintaining tinyAgent's philosophy of simplicity and atomic tools.

## Validation

âœ… All existing tests pass  
âœ… New tests added and passing  
âœ… Examples updated and working  
âœ… README simplified and improved  
âœ… Final answer mechanism verified working
