# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Structured Error Handling
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a unified error handling system with custom exceptions, retry logic, and backoff strategies.
# Details:
Define a hierarchy of custom exceptions (ToolError, LLMError, ConfigError, etc.). Implement decorators to capture and classify errors. Create a retry mechanism with configurable backoff strategies. Add logging with appropriate verbosity levels. Ensure errors bubble up with context when they can't be handled. Implement fallback strategies for common failure modes. Create a way to surface actionable logs to users.

# Test Strategy:
Test various error scenarios and verify correct exception types are raised. Verify retry logic works with different backoff strategies. Test logging output for clarity and actionability. Ensure errors don't get swallowed silently.
