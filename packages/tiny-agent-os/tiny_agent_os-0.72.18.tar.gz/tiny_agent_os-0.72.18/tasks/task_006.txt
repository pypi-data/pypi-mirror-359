# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop tiny_chain Orchestrator
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the orchestration system that can plan and execute multi-step tool sequences.
# Details:
Implement factory/tiny_chain.py with the orchestrator that can break complex tasks into steps. Create a triage LLM component that proposes execution plans. Implement plan execution with proper error handling and fallbacks. Support the Plan data model with ordered lists of tools and arguments. Create fallback logic to try alternative tools when the primary plan fails. Implement a tracing system to record execution steps and results.

# Test Strategy:
Test with multi-step scenarios requiring multiple tools. Verify plans are sensible and execute correctly. Test fallback mechanisms when primary tools fail. Evaluate plan quality across different types of complex queries.
