# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement JSON I/O Enforcement
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a system to guarantee machine-readable outputs through schema validation and parsing.
# Details:
Implement schema-first validation for tool inputs and outputs. Create LLM prompts that enforce JSON compliance. Develop fallback parsers to handle non-compliant responses. Implement type coercion for common schema mismatches. Support both strict and lenient validation modes configurable by the user. Create clear error messages for schema violations. Ensure downstream systems can reliably parse results.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various input/output scenarios including edge cases. Verify schema validation catches errors appropriately. Test the parser's ability to recover structured data from text. Benchmark performance impact of validation.
