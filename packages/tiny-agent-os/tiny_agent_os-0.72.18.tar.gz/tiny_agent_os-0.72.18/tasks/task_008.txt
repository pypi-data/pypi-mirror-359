# Description: Develop a set of built-in tools for common tasks like search, web browsing, and summarization.
# Details:
Implement search tool using DuckDuckGo API. Create a browser/scraper tool for web content extraction. Develop a summarization tool leveraging LLMs. Ensure each tool follows the @tool pattern and includes comprehensive documentation. Implement proper error handling and rate limiting. Create helper functions for common operations. Package these as optional dependencies to keep the core library lean.

# Test Strategy:
Test each tool with realistic usage scenarios. Verify proper handling of API limits and errors. Test with various input types and edge cases. Measure performance and reliability over time.
