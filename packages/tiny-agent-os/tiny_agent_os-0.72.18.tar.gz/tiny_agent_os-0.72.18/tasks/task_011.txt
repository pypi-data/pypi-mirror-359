# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Vector Memory with ChromaDB
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a vector-based memory system using ChromaDB to store conversation history and enable contextual retrieval for the agent.
# Details:
Implement a `VectorMemory` class that uses ChromaDB as the backend storage:

1. Set up ChromaDB integration:
   - Install required packages: `chromadb` and `sentence-transformers`
   - Create a wrapper class that initializes a ChromaDB collection
   - Support configuration for persistence directory to maintain memory across restarts

2. Implement core memory functionality:
   - Create an `add(role, content)` method that embeds and stores messages in the collection
   - Implement a `fetch(k)` method that retrieves the k most relevant previous interactions
   - Support both OpenAI embeddings and local models like all-MiniLM
   - Ensure proper metadata tagging (role, timestamp) for each stored message

3. Integrate with TinyAgent:
   - Modify the Agent constructor to accept a `memory` parameter
   - Update the prompt construction to prepend relevant context from memory
   - Implement token counting to limit retrieved context to ~500 tokens
   - Add a mechanism to filter out irrelevant context based on similarity scores

4. Optimize for performance:
   - Cache embeddings to avoid redundant computation
   - Implement batched embedding for efficiency
   - Add configuration options for tuning retrieval parameters (k, similarity threshold)

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests:
   - Test the `add` method correctly stores messages with proper metadata
   - Verify `fetch` retrieves the most semantically relevant messages
   - Test persistence works by creating a collection, restarting, and verifying data remains
   - Validate token counting and truncation logic works correctly

2. Integration tests:
   - Create a multi-turn conversation scenario and verify the agent correctly retrieves and uses context
   - Test with both OpenAI and local embedding models
   - Verify memory improves agent responses in scenarios requiring context from past interactions
   - Test edge cases: empty memory, very large context, similar but different queries

3. Performance testing:
   - Measure embedding time for different chunk sizes
   - Test retrieval speed with varying collection sizes (100, 1000, 10000 entries)
   - Benchmark memory usage to ensure it scales reasonably

4. Example validation:
   - Create a sample conversation that references information from several turns back
   - Verify the agent correctly recalls and uses that information without explicit reminders

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up ChromaDB integration and core infrastructure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the VectorMemory class with ChromaDB backend and implement basic initialization and configuration
### Details:
1. Install required dependencies: `pip install chromadb sentence-transformers`
2. Create a `VectorMemory` class with the following:
   - Constructor that accepts parameters for persistence_directory, embedding_model (default to 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'), and collection_name
   - Initialize ChromaDB client with persistence settings
   - Create or get an existing collection with the specified name

I've examined the initial implementation in `src/tinyagent/utils/vector_memory.py` and can provide these additional implementation notes:

For better error handling and performance:
- Add error handling for embedding model loading failures with graceful fallbacks
- Implement connection pooling for ChromaDB client to improve performance under concurrent access
- Add a caching layer for frequently accessed embeddings to reduce computation overhead

For the embedding functionality:
- The `_embed_text()` method should handle text chunking for long inputs that exceed model context windows
- Consider implementing batched embedding processing for multiple texts to improve throughput

Implementation specifics:
- Add a `__del__` method to ensure proper cleanup of ChromaDB resources
- Implement a context manager interface (with `__enter__` and `__exit__`) for safe resource management
- Add a `health_check()` method to verify ChromaDB connection and embedding model availability

Testing recommendations:
- Create unit tests with pytest fixtures that use a temporary directory for ChromaDB persistence
- Include tests for switching embedding models at runtime
- Test with various text types including multilingual content to ensure embedding quality

## 2. Implement core memory operations [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create methods to add, retrieve, and query conversation history with proper embedding and metadata
### Details:
1. Implement the `add(role, content)` method:
   - Format the message content into a storable format
   - Generate embeddings for the content using the configured embedding model
   - Create metadata including role, timestamp, and token count
   - Add the document to the ChromaDB collection with unique IDs
   - Implement batching for efficiency when adding multiple items
2. Implement retrieval methods:
   - `fetch(query, k=5)` to retrieve k most relevant messages based on a query
   - `fetch_recent(k=5)` to retrieve k most recent messages chronologically
   - `fetch_by_similarity(query, threshold=0.7, max_results=10)` to retrieve messages above a similarity threshold
3. Add utility methods:
   - `count_tokens(text)` to estimate token count for content
   - `clear()` to reset the memory when needed
   - `get_stats()` to return information about memory usage
4. Implement caching for embeddings to avoid redundant computation
5. Test the implementation by:
   - Adding various messages with different roles
   - Retrieving messages using different query methods
   - Verifying correct metadata and content retrieval
   - Measuring performance with and without caching

Here's additional information for the VectorMemory implementation checklist:

```
Implementation details for robust VectorMemory:

1. Constructor and initialization:
   - Add parameter validation in __init__(persist_directory='./memory', embedding_model_name='all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

   - Handle ChromaDB client initialization with proper error handling

2. Thread safety:
   - Implement self._lock = threading.Lock() in __init__

     ```python
     def add(self, role, content):
         with self._lock:
             # Add operation implementation
     ```

3. Embedding model handling:
   - Create _init_embedding_model() to load model based on self.embedding_model_name
   - Support local models with sentence-transformers and API-based models
   - Add fallback mechanism if primary model fails to load

4. Token management:
   - Implement _truncate(content_list, max_tokens) method using tiktoken
   - Add adaptive truncation that preserves most relevant content when over token limit
   - Include token counting that handles different tokenizer models

5. Exception handling:
   - Add input validation with descriptive error messages for all public methods
   - Implement graceful degradation when ChromaDB operations fail
   - Add logging for critical operations and errors
