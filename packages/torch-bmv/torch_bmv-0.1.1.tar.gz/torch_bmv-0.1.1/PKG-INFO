Batched matrix-vector multiplication in PyTorch which intelligently rearranges tensor shapes for efficient computation.

# Install
`pip install torch-bmv`

# Example
```
import torch
from torch_bmv import bmv

A = torch.randn(1, 4, 5)
x = torch.randn(10, 5)
out = bmv(A, x)
assert out.shape == (10, 4)
```
