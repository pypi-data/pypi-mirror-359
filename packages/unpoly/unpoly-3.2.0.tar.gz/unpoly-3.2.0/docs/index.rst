Welcome to Unpoly's documentation!
==================================

Unpoly is a framework agnostic python library implementing the `Unpoly server protocol <https://unpoly.com/up.protocol>`_.
It currently ships with adapters for `Django <https://djangoproject.com>`_ and
`Starlette <https://www.starlette.io>`_ but can be easily integrated with
other frameworks as well by writing a small :ref:`adapter<adapters>`.
