<h1 align="center">VertexCache Client SDK for Python</h1>

This is the official **Client SDK** for **Python**, provided by the VertexCache project.  
It communicates with the VertexCache server using a **raw TCP socket** and the binary **VCMP protocol** for high-performance, low-latency operations.

> **What is VertexCache?**  
> VertexCache is a high-performance, open-source in-memory caching system designed for speed, flexibility, and developer-friendly integration. It supports primary and multi-level secondary indexing for fast lookups and reduced database I/O.
>
> Powered by a custom binary protocol (VCMP), VertexCache offers low-latency, encrypted communication with built-in clustering, logging, and configuration support.  
> **With 10 official Client SDKs already available — and more on the way — VertexCache is built for cross-language flexibility.** A lightweight **REST API** is also available for easy integration anywhere.
>
> Licensed under Apache 2.0, VertexCache is production-ready, customizable, and optimized for modern workloads.
