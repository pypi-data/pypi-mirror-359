# Vonc

**Vonc** is an experimental Python web framework accelerated with Rust and powered by PyO3.

This project demonstrates how to:

- Build core HTTP functionality in Rust
- Compile to a Python wheel using `maturin`
- Use the resulting module inside Python for fast, safe execution

> Built as a playground to explore the intersection of Python web dev and Rust performance.
