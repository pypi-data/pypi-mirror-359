class ElectionState:
    """
    Class for storing information about a round of an election. Round 0 should be
    the initial state of the election. To save memory, the PreferenceProfile is
    not carried by the ElectionState class.

    Attributes:
        round_number (int, optional): Round number, defaults to 0.
        remaining (tuple[frozenset[str],...], optional): Remaining candidates, ordered to indicate
            ranking, frozensets to indicate ties. Defaults to tuple with one empty set.
        elected (tuple[frozenset[str],...], optional): Elected candidates, ordered to indicate
            ranking, frozensets to indicate ties. Defaults to tuple with one empty set.
        eliminated (tuple[frozenset[str],...], optional): Eliminated candidates, ordered to indicate
            ranking, frozensets to indicate ties. Defaults to tuple with one empty set.
        tiebreaks (dict[frozenset[str], tuple[frozenset[str],...]], optional): Stores
            tiebreak resolutions. Keys are frozensets of tied candidates and values are resolutions
            of tiebreak. Defaults to empty dictionary.
        scores(dict[str, float], optional): Stores score information.
            Keys are candidates, values are scores. Only remaining candidates should be stored.
