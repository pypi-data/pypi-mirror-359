## About The Project

There is a range of GraphQL packages for Python and specifically Django.
However, getting these packages to work out of the box with an existing infrastructure
without errors isn't as easy to come by.

The purpose of Grapple is to be able to build GraphQL endpoints on a model by model
basis as quickly as possible. The setup and configuration have been designed
to be as simple but also provide the best features;
No complex serializers need to be written - just add a `graphql_fields` list
to your model and away you go (although if you want to go deeper you can!).

### Features

-   Easily create GraphQL types by adding a small annotation in your models.
-   Supports traditional Wagtail models:
    -   Pages (including StreamField & Orderables)
    -   Snippets
    -   Images
    -   Documents
    -   Media (via [wagtailmedia](https://pypi.org/project/wagtailmedia/))
    -   Settings
    -   Redirects
    -   Search (on all models)
-   Custom Image & Document model support
-   Pagination support
-   Middleware support

### Built With

This library is an abstraction upon and relies heavily on Graphene & Graphene Django.

-   [Graphene](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene)
-   [Graphene Django](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene)

## Getting Started

Getting Grapple installed is designed to be as simple as possible!

### Prerequisites

```
Python >= 3.9
Wagtail >= 6.3
Django >= 4.2
```

### Installation

Install using pip

```bash
python -m pip install wagtail_grapple
```

Add the following to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in your Wagtail settings file:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    "grapple",
    "graphene_django",
    # ...
]
```

Add the following to the bottom of the same settings file, where each key is the app you want to this library to scan and the value is the prefix you want to give to GraphQL types (you can usually leave this blank):

```python
# Grapple config:
GRAPHENE = {"SCHEMA": "grapple.schema.schema"}
GRAPPLE = {
    "APPS": ["home"],
}
```

Add the GraphQL URLs to your `urls.py`:

```python
from django.urls import include, path
from grapple import urls as grapple_urls

# ...
urlpatterns = [
    # ...
    path("api/", include(grapple_urls)),
    # ...
]
```

Done! Now you can proceed onto configuring your models to generate GraphQL types that adopt their structure :tada:
_Your GraphQL endpoint is available at [http://localhost:8000/api/graphql/](http://localhost:8000/api/graphql/)_

## Usage

Here is a GraphQL model configuration for the default page from the Wagtail docs:

```python
# ...
from grapple.models import GraphQLString, GraphQLStreamfield


class BlogPage(Page):
    author = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    date = models.DateField("Post date")
    body = StreamField(
        [
            ("heading", blocks.CharBlock(classname="full title")),
            ("paragraph", blocks.RichTextBlock()),
            ("image", ImageChooserBlock()),
        ]
    )

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel("author"),
        FieldPanel("date"),
        StreamFieldPanel("body"),
    ]

    # Note these fields below:
    graphql_fields = [
        GraphQLString("heading"),
        GraphQLString("date"),
        GraphQLString("author"),
        GraphQLStreamfield("body"),
    ]
```
