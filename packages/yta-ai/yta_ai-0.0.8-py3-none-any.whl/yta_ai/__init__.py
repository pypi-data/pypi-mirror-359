"""
Full AI module.

TODO: Maybe we should create individual libraries
for all the different AIs we will use, so we don't
need to install all the libraries if we want to
use only one, avoiding this 'yta_ai' library, that
will be used only if we want to have all them
available and install all the libraries we need.
