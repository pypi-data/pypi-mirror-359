Welcome to Youtube Autonomous Audio Narration
Ttsmp3 Voice Module.

This engine has been extracted from here:
- https://ttsmp3.com/

This voice engine has just a limit of
3.000 characters of input when generating
with normal voices, and 1.000 daily
characters when using AI. AI is disabled
by now as the limit makes it not
interesting for our purpose.
