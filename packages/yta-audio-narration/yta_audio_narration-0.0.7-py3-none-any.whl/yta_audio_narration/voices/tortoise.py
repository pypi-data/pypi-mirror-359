This voice engine is based in Coqui and I
have another voice engine which is Coqui,
but using other voice narrators.

TODO: Consider mixing both voice engines
and appending this voice narrator to the
Coqui system and keep only one of them.

-- Update 19/04/2025 --
I've found that they created a fork in
https://github.com/idiap/coqui-ai-TTS with
a new version that is maintained, and the 
'tts' was generating conflicts.
