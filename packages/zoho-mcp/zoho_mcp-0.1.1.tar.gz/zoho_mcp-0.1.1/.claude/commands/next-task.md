# Next Task

Find the next task in `specs/tasks/oath/todo.md`, read the prompt for the task from prompt file in `specs/tasks/oath` folder, and implement it to completion. You are only complete when you have written unit tests for the task and all of those unit tests pass. Upon completion, run all tests to ensure you have not broken any previous tests. If you have, fix them. Once you have done all of this, mark the task as complete in the todo list and move on to the next task.

4. Think hard and determine if you need any documentation listed in the table of contents to complete the task. If you do, read the documentation.
5. Implement the task you found in step 1 to completion
6. Write unit tests for the task
7. Run all tests to ensure you have not broken any previous tests
