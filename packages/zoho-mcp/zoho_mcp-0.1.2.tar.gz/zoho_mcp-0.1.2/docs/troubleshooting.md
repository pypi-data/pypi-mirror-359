## Authentication Issues

### Invalid Credentials

**Symptoms:**
- "Authentication failed" errors
- "Invalid client credentials" messages
- Tools fail with authorization errors

**Possible Causes:**
- Incorrect Client ID or Client Secret
- Mistyped credentials in .env file
- Wrong region selected

**Solutions:**
1. Double-check your Zoho Books API credentials in the `.env` file
2. Verify the credentials in the Zoho API Console
3. Ensure your credentials are for the correct Zoho datacenter/region
4. Regenerate API credentials if necessary

**Example Error:**
```
ZohoAuthError: Authentication failed: invalid_client_secret - Client secret is invalid
```

### Token Expiration

**Symptoms:**
- Tools worked before but suddenly stopped working
- "Token expired" or "Invalid grant" errors

**Possible Causes:**
- Refresh token has expired
- Refresh token was revoked
- Token permissions changed

**Solutions:**
1. Use the automatic OAuth setup flow (recommended):
   ```
   python server.py --setup-oauth
   ```
   This will guide you through the authentication process and automatically save the refresh token.

2. Or manually:
   - Generate a new refresh token from the Zoho API Console
   - Update the `ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN` in your `.env` file
   - Restart the MCP server

**Example Error:**
```
ZohoAuthError: Authentication failed: invalid_token - expired or revoked
```

### Organization Access

**Symptoms:**
- Authentication succeeds but you get "organization not found" errors
- Cannot access organization-specific data

**Possible Causes:**
- Incorrect Organization ID
- Account doesn't have access to the specified organization
- API access not enabled for the organization

**Solutions:**
1. Verify your Organization ID in Zoho Books (Setup > Organizations)
2. Check that your user account has access to the organization
3. Enable API access for the organization in Zoho Books settings

**Example Error:**
```
ZohoAPIError: Organization not found or access denied: organization_id=123456789
```

## Automatic OAuth Flow Setup

The Zoho Books MCP server provides an automatic OAuth flow to simplify the authentication process.

### Creating a Zoho API Application

Before using the OAuth setup, you need to create a server-side application in the Zoho API Console:

1. Go to [Zoho API Console](https://api-console.zoho.com/)

2. Sign in with your Zoho account credentials.

3. Click **Add Client** to create a new application.

4. Select **Server-based Applications** as the client type.

5. Fill in the required details:
   - **Client Name**: A name for your application (e.g., "Zoho Books MCP")
   - **Homepage URL**: Your website URL or `http://localhost` for local development
   - **Authorized Redirect URIs**: Add `http://localhost:8099/callback` (or your custom port)
   - **Description**: Brief description of your application

6. Click **Create**.

7. After creation, you'll receive your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Save these values securely - you'll need them in the next step.

8. Under the **Scopes** tab, add the required scopes:
   - For full access to all Books features: `ZohoBooks.fullaccess.all`
   - Or select specific scopes like `ZohoBooks.contacts.READ`, `ZohoBooks.invoices.CREATE`, etc.

### Using the OAuth Setup Command

To automatically set up OAuth authentication:

1. Ensure you have the following values in your `.env` file:
   ```
   ZOHO_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
   ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
   ZOHO_ORGANIZATION_ID="your_organization_id"  
   ZOHO_REGION="US"  # Change according to your region (US, EU, IN, AU, CA, etc.)
   ```

2. Run the OAuth setup command:
   ```
   python server.py --setup-oauth
   ```

3. Your default web browser will open automatically to the Zoho authentication page.

4. Log in to your Zoho account and grant the requested permissions.

5. After successful authentication, you will be redirected to a local page confirming the successful setup.

6. The refresh token will be automatically saved to your `.env` file.

7. You can now start the server normally with your chosen transport mode.

### Custom OAuth Callback Port

By default, the OAuth callback server runs on port 8099. If this port is unavailable, you can specify a different port:

```
python server.py --setup-oauth --oauth-port 9000
```

### Troubleshooting OAuth Setup

**Browser doesn't open automatically:**
- Copy the authorization URL displayed in the terminal
- Manually paste it into your browser
- Complete the authentication process

**Port conflict errors:**
- If you see "Address already in use" errors, try a different port with `--oauth-port`
- Ensure no other services are using the specified port

**Authentication timeout:**
- The default timeout is 5 minutes
- If the process times out, run the command again and complete the steps more quickly

**Authentication errors:**
- "Invalid client" error: Verify your Client ID and Client Secret are correct
- "Access denied" error: Make sure you're granting all requested permissions
- "Redirect URI mismatch": Ensure the redirect URI in your Zoho Developer Console matches `http://localhost:PORT/callback`

**Example Successful Flow:**
```
$ python server.py --setup-oauth

=== Zoho Books OAuth Setup ===

Authorization URL: https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/auth?scope=ZohoBooks.fullaccess.all&client_id=1000.XXXXXXXXXXXX&response_type=code&access_type=offline&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8099/callback

Attempting to open your default web browser...
Your browser should open automatically.

Waiting for authentication to complete...

âœ… OAuth setup completed successfully!
Refresh token has been saved to configuration.
```

   REQUEST_TIMEOUT=120
   ```
2. Break down large operations into smaller batches
3. Check your network connection
4. Try during off-peak hours when the API may be more responsive

**Example Error:**
```
ZohoRequestError: Request timed out after 60 seconds
```

### Unexpected Responses

**Symptoms:**
- Tool reports success but result is unexpected
- Missing or incorrect data in responses
- "Unexpected response format" errors

**Possible Causes:**
- API response format has changed
- Zoho Books updated their API
- Edge case not handled by the tool

**Solutions:**
1. Check the Zoho Books API documentation for changes
2. Enable debug logging to see the raw API responses
3. Report the issue to the server maintainers
4. Try a different approach to accomplish the same task

**Example Error:**
```
ZohoAPIError: Unexpected response format: missing expected field 'invoice'
```

## Logging and Debugging

### Enabling Debug Logging

To enable more detailed logging:

1. Add `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to your `.env` file

2. Or run the server with the `--log-level DEBUG` flag:
   ```
   python server.py --stdio --log-level DEBUG
   ```

3. To save logs to a file, add to your `.env`:
   ```
   LOG_FILE_PATH=/path/to/zoho-mcp.log
   ```

### Checking Server Logs

1. Look for the log file location:
   - If `LOG_FILE_PATH` is set, check that location
   - Otherwise, logs go to standard output

2. Common log file patterns:
   - General errors: `ERROR` level messages
   - Authentication issues: Look for `ZohoAuthError` entries
   - API problems: Look for `ZohoAPIError` entries
   - Transport issues: Look for `TransportError` entries

3. In debug mode, each API request and response will be logged

### Checking Client Logs

**Claude Desktop:**
1. Open the Claude menu and select "Show Logs"
2. Look for MCP-related entries:
   - `mcp.log` contains general MCP logging
   - `mcp-server-zoho-books.log` contains Zoho Books server-specific logs

**Cursor:**
1. Open Developer Tools (usually F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
2. Look for MCP-related messages in the Console tab
3. Network tab may show HTTP requests to the MCP server

## Common Error Messages

Below is a reference of common error messages and their likely causes:
